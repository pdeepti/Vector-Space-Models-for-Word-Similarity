german companies have expressed cautious optimism about upcoming business prospects .
a survey of german business confidence published on monday says nearly half of all companies expect production to expand . about 1,500 german companies took part in this year ‘ s spring survey , conducted by the cologne-based insitute for german economy , and to the surprise of many analysts their expectations were not at all gloom and doom .
in spite of high oil prices and a strong euro , german export industries in particular stand to profit once again from a robust demand for their products . thirty-eight percent of business leaders are convinced that the foreign trade boom will continue , making germany the world ’ s biggest exporter for a second year running .
but when it comes to domestic growth , the outlook is slightly bleaker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cell phone production at siemens michael hüther , who heads the institute says there has been a shift in the outlook for the domestic market .
" the optimism has cooled off a bit , but a relapse into stagnation is unlikely .
one sign of this is that companies are planning to start investing again . " investment plans and indeed one third of german companies said they would invest in new plant and technology in 2005 .
for the first time in many years , the number of businesses planning to invest outnumbers those which are not . production is also set to rise with 35 percent of companies in the east and 39 percent of those in the west expecting higher output .
with such predictions in the air , michael hüther sees little reason for pessimism .
" given the current economic data , we think a growth rate of between one and one point five percent would be realistic . " but not everyone shares in his optimism .
last week the eu commission forecast that german growth would drop to a meagre 0.8 percent this year . unfounded fears ? mr hüther also sought to dispel fears of a dramatic drop in tax revenues as a result of dwindling economic growth .
on monday , two other german economic institutes warned of a seven billion euro gap opening up in the current government budget as a result of the economic downturn .
finance minister hans eichel played down worries about a further shortfall , dismissing them as totally groundless . " tax revenues in march were most satisfactory , and in the entire first quarter of 2005 they lived up to estimates made last year .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point . " a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .

a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 german tv looks to us for salvation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these women are desperate ; german tv is reaching that point on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .
it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .

in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .

" their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .

last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production .

critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 german tv looks to us for salvation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these women are desperate ; german tv is reaching that point on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .
it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .

why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .

the man held the girls in a house in ennepetal , north rhine-westphalia , for five hours . the man , thought to be a 50-year-old iranian , pulled two knives on a bus that the children were taking home from school shortly before 1 p.m.
cet , eyewitnesses said .
he reportedly tied up ten of the children and forced them and the driver out of the bus .
several of the kids were then able to escape , but four girls , aged between 11 and 16 , failed to get away . the man pushed aside a woman unlocking the door to her house and forced the girls into the cellar , where he remained holed up with them for hours .
the police were able to make contact with the man , though he did n't issue any demands . special forces managed to overpower the man shortly after 6 p.m. and free the hostages . speaking to reporters , police said that one of the girls had a small , non-threatening knife wound , and that the others were unharmed .
their captive suffered some injuries when he was overpowered , though police refused to give any further details . the children were reunited with their families shortly after their release and were given psychological support .
witnesses said the man wanted his family to be brought from iran to germany .
" he said he was unhappy with the german government and that 's why he wanted to take hostages , " one of the girls who managed to escape told dpa .
police have cordoned off the area surrounding the house where the man held the girls .
neighborhood residents said he lived in a nearby street . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback if you would like to comment on this or any other dw-world article , please send us a message , including your full name and country . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point . " a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .
-lrb- april 09 , 2005 -rrb- can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?
as demonstrators take to germany 's streets again on monday to protest the government ’ s planned labor reforms , the spd is trying to diffuse the discontent by rekindling a public debate on minimum wages .
-lrb- aug .
23 , 2005 -rrb- the german struggle with a minimum wage contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .
-lrb- april 09 , 2005 -rrb- can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?
as demonstrators take to germany 's streets again on monday to protest the government ’ s planned labor reforms , the spd is trying to diffuse the discontent by rekindling a public debate on minimum wages .
-lrb- aug .
23 , 2005 -rrb- the german struggle with a minimum wage contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling .

are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .

we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

" if it becomes clear that the economy is getting weaker , then financial policy has to be aware not to make the problems bigger . " eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said the the european union 's executive commission is keeping a close eye on the budget situations of france and germany this year . but he said that the situation was more difficult in germany because of weak economic growth . the european commission estimated last week that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , would grow only 0.8 percent this year , the slowest rate in the 12-nation bloc .
it also forecast that germany would have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year , in excess of eu rules for deficits no greater than 3.0 percent . greece doing better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens is promising to get its finances in order eu finance ministers meanwhile accepted the promise by their greek colleague to keep his country 's deficit in check .
they agreed not to impose further sanctions against greece , which has said it will bring its deficit below the maximum level allowed by the eu 's stability and growth pact , which sets a limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . greece has not managed to stay below the limit so far and last year 's deficit is estimated to be 6.1 perceent . sanctions against italy ? italy now also faces sanctions by the eu : almunia said at tuesday 's meeting that he will present a report on the matter before the end of june .
according to eu officials , italy 's deficit will be 3.6 percent this year and 4.6 percent in 2006 and would hence violate the pact . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pact reform removes obstacles for east the road into the euro zone for countries in eastern europe has become smoother after the agreement by eu leaders last week to relax budget rules , ministers and analysts say .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .

advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .

advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .

" a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers really need a minimum wage ?
unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .

advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses .

according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the german struggle with a minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers need the protection of a minimum wage ?
contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses .

according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .

" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point .

" karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .
the fair is mainly a place for investors and inventors to meet but actual sales of products are restricted to a small area where 40 exhibitors show off their wares . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the german struggle with a minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers need the protection of a minimum wage ?
contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

" if it becomes clear that the economy is getting weaker , then financial policy has to be aware not to make the problems bigger . " eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said the the european union 's executive commission is keeping a close eye on the budget situations of france and germany this year . but he said that the situation was more difficult in germany because of weak economic growth . the european commission estimated last week that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , would grow only 0.8 percent this year , the slowest rate in the 12-nation bloc .
it also forecast that germany would have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year , in excess of eu rules for deficits no greater than 3.0 percent . greece doing better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens is promising to get its finances in order eu finance ministers meanwhile accepted the promise by their greek colleague to keep his country 's deficit in check .
they agreed not to impose further sanctions against greece , which has said it will bring its deficit below the maximum level allowed by the eu 's stability and growth pact , which sets a limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . greece has not managed to stay below the limit so far and last year 's deficit is estimated to be 6.1 perceent . sanctions against italy ? italy now also faces sanctions by the eu : almunia said at tuesday 's meeting that he will present a report on the matter before the end of june .
according to eu officials , italy 's deficit will be 3.6 percent this year and 4.6 percent in 2006 and would hence violate the pact . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pact reform removes obstacles for east the road into the euro zone for countries in eastern europe has become smoother after the agreement by eu leaders last week to relax budget rules , ministers and analysts say .

" mein kampf . "
it 's just one inconspicuous detail in a new donald duck comic which came on the german market in time for april fool 's day . the story finds donald 's nephews , huey , dewey and louie , rummaging around in a garbage dump .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.04.2005 the weird and wacky wow geneva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a navigation system for the blind caused jaws to drop in geneva the 33rd international exhibition of inventions in geneva has ended and while the motives of many were fame and fortune as inventors searched out investors , some were just there to make visitors go wow . the swiss city of geneva played host to some of the most creative minds on the planet : over 1000 inventions from 42 countries were on display at the 33rd annual geneva inventors fair with every single one being exhibited for the first time ever .
all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .

" in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .

a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .

a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

acccording to his research , they make up as much as a quarter of the vast clouds of fine dust in the atmosphere . jaenicke said it 's still unclear what effect the bio-pollutants might have on the world 's climate , but added that dandruff should certainly be taken into consideration by researchers . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .
the fair is mainly a place for investors and inventors to meet but actual sales of products are restricted to a small area where 40 exhibitors show off their wares . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

platthaus has combed through all the donald duck stories , looking for instances where the characters drag the nazis through the mud . sometimes , the originals have been retouched . but according to platthaus , " mein kampf " can also be found in the garbage dump in the american original .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers really need a minimum wage ?
unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point .

" karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .

in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .

critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .

many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .

a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

" eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said the the european union 's executive commission is keeping a close eye on the budget situations of france and germany this year . but he said that the situation was more difficult in germany because of weak economic growth . the european commission estimated last week that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , would grow only 0.8 percent this year , the slowest rate in the 12-nation bloc .

according to eu officials , italy 's deficit will be 3.6 percent this year and 4.6 percent in 2006 and would hence violate the pact . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pact reform removes obstacles for east the road into the euro zone for countries in eastern europe has become smoother after the agreement by eu leaders last week to relax budget rules , ministers and analysts say .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point . " a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .

and not for the first time , either .
disney comics frequently take ironic jabs at germany 's nazi past . in a heap along with a broken drum , an old tire and other garbage lies a green book , right where it belongs .
the title ?
" mein kampf . "
it 's just one inconspicuous detail in a new donald duck comic which came on the german market in time for april fool 's day . the story finds donald 's nephews , huey , dewey and louie , rummaging around in a garbage dump .
the balloon above hitler 's doctrine of hate reads : " they 're always good for an april fool 's joke .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .

other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2005 eu opens door to serbia and montenegro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade hopes to celebrate eu membership by 2012 the european commission on tuesday recommended the opening of negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement with serbia and montenegro , the first step towards the country 's eu integration . an agreement would give serbia and montenegro access to eu financial aid .
the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point . " a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 german tv looks to us for salvation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these women are desperate ; german tv is reaching that point on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .
it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the german struggle with a minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers need the protection of a minimum wage ?
contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .

advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .
-lrb- april 09 , 2005 -rrb- can minimum wage debate pacify protesters ?

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .

many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .
the fair is mainly a place for investors and inventors to meet but actual sales of products are restricted to a small area where 40 exhibitors show off their wares . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point . " a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the german struggle with a minimum wage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers need the protection of a minimum wage ?
contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

and not for the first time , either .
disney comics frequently take ironic jabs at germany 's nazi past . in a heap along with a broken drum , an old tire and other garbage lies a green book , right where it belongs .
the title ?
" mein kampf . "
it 's just one inconspicuous detail in a new donald duck comic which came on the german market in time for april fool 's day . the story finds donald 's nephews , huey , dewey and louie , rummaging around in a garbage dump .
the balloon above hitler 's doctrine of hate reads : " they 're always good for an april fool 's joke . " " the story originated in 1948 , so you have to see it in its historical context , " said andreas platthaus , head of d.o.n.a.l.d , a german fan organization dedicated to the study of ' donaldism ' . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " de-nazified " version : in some editions , the book on the garbage heap bears the title " mein kampf . "
platthaus has combed through all the donald duck stories , looking for instances where the characters drag the nazis through the mud . sometimes , the originals have been retouched . but according to platthaus , " mein kampf " can also be found in the garbage dump in the american original .
" that the americans would joke about it is hardly surprising , " he said . the donald comics ' german translator , erika fuchs - who herself fled the nazis - would also often build in references , the donaldist said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once upon a time , donald spoke of the wehrmacht in this balloon - now he refers to the " pioneers . "
" for example , in ' die braven brückenbauer ' -lrb- the chickadee challenge -rrb- there 's a boy scouts leader who in one edition was a former employee with the german army , but in another edition , she 's a former restaurant employee , " said platthaus .
" there are at least two or three dozen nazi references in the donald duck stories " he estimated . need to laugh and in no way should they be interpreted as a glorification of the regime , stressed d.o.n.a.l.d 's president patrick martin . whether it is books added to a garbage heap or particularly authoritative structures in the boy scouts : " germany still has an unnatural way of dealing with the past .
poking fun in this way is important , because you have to be allowed to laugh about it - within limits , of course . " while the nazi jibes in the 1950 's-era comics are hidden in tiny details , disney cartoons made during world war ii often contained overt anti-nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald 's nephews say " hallo " where they once said " heil . "
" the most famous film is ' the fuehrer 's face ' from 1943 , " platthaus said .
" in it , donald duck dreams that he is an assembly-line worker in nazi germany , and is forced to salute the führer every time his picture appears .
in the last shot , you see him hugging the statue of liberty . " superworker ? other comic heroes were also called upon to battle the nazis during wartime . " of course there were comics where superman beats up hitler , " platthaus said .
looney tunes and warner brothers explored similar anti-nazi themes . comic propaganda even persisted during communist times in east germany , for example with the 1970 's-era series " fröhlich sein und singen " -lrb- be happy and sing -rrb- - albeit featuring specially-developed worker-hero characters . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

acccording to his research , they make up as much as a quarter of the vast clouds of fine dust in the atmosphere . jaenicke said it 's still unclear what effect the bio-pollutants might have on the world 's climate , but added that dandruff should certainly be taken into consideration by researchers . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

" if it becomes clear that the economy is getting weaker , then financial policy has to be aware not to make the problems bigger . " eu economic affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said the the european union 's executive commission is keeping a close eye on the budget situations of france and germany this year . but he said that the situation was more difficult in germany because of weak economic growth . the european commission estimated last week that the german economy , the biggest in the eurozone , would grow only 0.8 percent this year , the slowest rate in the 12-nation bloc .
it also forecast that germany would have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year , in excess of eu rules for deficits no greater than 3.0 percent . greece doing better bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens is promising to get its finances in order eu finance ministers meanwhile accepted the promise by their greek colleague to keep his country 's deficit in check .
they agreed not to impose further sanctions against greece , which has said it will bring its deficit below the maximum level allowed by the eu 's stability and growth pact , which sets a limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . greece has not managed to stay below the limit so far and last year 's deficit is estimated to be 6.1 perceent . sanctions against italy ? italy now also faces sanctions by the eu : almunia said at tuesday 's meeting that he will present a report on the matter before the end of june .
according to eu officials , italy 's deficit will be 3.6 percent this year and 4.6 percent in 2006 and would hence violate the pact . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pact reform removes obstacles for east the road into the euro zone for countries in eastern europe has become smoother after the agreement by eu leaders last week to relax budget rules , ministers and analysts say .

the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.04.2005 eu opens door to serbia and montenegro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgrade hopes to celebrate eu membership by 2012 the european commission on tuesday recommended the opening of negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement with serbia and montenegro , the first step towards the country 's eu integration . an agreement would give serbia and montenegro access to eu financial aid .
the european commission linked the start of the negotiations with a feasibility study on serbia and montenegro prepared by finnish eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
european sources said this contained " a lot of conditions , " some of which are linked to the balkan state 's economy . the european central bank , for instance , expects a positive signal for foreign investors .
however , the main condition relates to the cooperation of serbia with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . solana praises cooperation eu foreign policy chief javier solana last week praised serbia 's recent cooperation with the un war crimes court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's president boris tadic -lrb- left -rrb- and solana at a meeting in belgrade last october " we hope very , very much that we will continue with the same commitment that we have seen in the last period of time , " he said .
" you know the importance the european union and the international community as a whole attaches to this point . " a total of 13 serbian or bosnian serb officers have surrendered to the icty during the past several months after serbia came under intense international pressure for failing to work closely with the court . belgrade under pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertising poster with wanted posters of the bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and his military commander gen.ratko mladic near the bosnian serb controlled village of celebici belgrade is still under pressure to help track down bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic and bosnian serb political leader radovan karadzic , wanted for the 1995 massacre in the eastern town of srebrenica , where bosnian serb forces killed some 8,000 muslim males in the worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . " karadzic and mladic have to stand trial , " the commissioner rehn said on tuesday , adding that no one can even begin thinking about an eu membership for serbia and montenegro until the country fully cooperates with the icty . the eu has shown it is not prepared to compromise on the question of war crimes in the former yugoslavia with eu foreign ministers refusing to open membership talks with croatia as scheduled on march 17 due to its failure to help find a war crimes fugitive , former general ante gotovina . politicians in serbia and montenegro , a loose federation of the two former yugoslav republics that was set up in 2003 , hope the eu 's feasibility study will help them gain political points at home if it comes to a positive conclusion . improved relations last week , serbia 's deputy prime minister , miroljub labus , visited germany and france in a bid to drum up support for his country .
he said on his return that the atmosphere between belgrade , berlin and paris had improved considerably over the last six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miroljub labus during his 2002 presidential bid " i expect the european union to produce a positive feasibility study , " he said .
" both germany and france want to support us technically , diplomatically and financially so that we can achieve our agenda . " this agenda is dubbed " europe 2012 . "
in seven years ' time at the latest , serbia and montenegro wants to be a part of the european union - despite the huge problems that still exist in the federation .
only last week , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had to mediate between the governments of the two sister-republics , which were squabbling over technical details . the publication of the feasibility study has already had to be postponed once , so the european commission will clearly be at pains not to send out the wrong signals to the balkan state when it takes its decision on tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de competing in the war criminals stakes croatia , known for cooperating with the un war crimes court at the hague , now finds it 's been caught up by serbia , and risks losing its advantage in terms of its international reputation , analysts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 german tv looks to us for salvation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these women are desperate ; german tv is reaching that point on tuesday , the us hit tv series “ desperate housewives ” hits the airwaves in germany .
it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .

the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .
the fair is mainly a place for investors and inventors to meet but actual sales of products are restricted to a small area where 40 exhibitors show off their wares . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing german innovation a recent study into the " to be or not to be " of self-employment revealed a national reluctance among germans to go it alone .

all exhibitors were looking for a patent , and a sponsor . inventors have long had to contend with being portrayed as wacky eccentrics stumbling from darkened laboratories to blink self-consciously in the light of publicity once their work is done . while the stereotype remains , the reality shows that inventors are no longer the bumbling social misfits whose imaginations forge the world around us .
many are driven as much by financial success and acclaim as by the desire to help humanity . despite the contemporary incentives of fame and fortune , the inventors at the international exhibition of inventions still managed to enforce the image that their ideas come predominantly from leftfield . the weird and wonderful on show among some of the wilder creations on show this year were the folding fins that allow divers to walk without falling over and the cycling crash helmet that unfolds from a backpack in the event of a fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding two coconut shells in his hands , dan palil of malaysia wears his invention , a motorcycle helmet using waste material of coconut fibers at the 33rd international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland one malaysian invention that has attracted attention is a coconut-husking machine , more so for the innovative use of the leftovers .
inventor dan pilal told reporters that the husks are ideal for making crash helmets which , he claimed , adhere to government safety standards . another invention which may turn out to be the next extreme sport fad , or not , was the freebouncing board , a mix of skateboarding and kitesurfing .
freebouncing , according to its swiss inventor , involves a skateboard being strapped to one 's feet and jumping up and down while hanging from a specially-adapted bungee rope slung from a bridge or some other structure . useful innovation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuart rees of australia presents his invention , the double chuck drill at the 33st international exhibition of inventions , new techniques and products in geneva , switzerland .
the electric hand drill features two distinct chucks that automatically change to allow different drill bits or drivers as required , allowing for safer and faster construction .
other inventions were more down-to-earth and useful , such as the device for collecting rainwater that can then be used to water a garden or flush toilets , or the tiny gps mini-chip that could help owners find lost pets .
fitted on a dog ’ s collar , it gives a location within a ten-meter radius . however , the jury prize went to an invention from france : a new , non-polluting method of cleaning the hulls of boats , without taking them out of the water . but the inventors oscar prize , went , perhaps surprisingly to ahmed alhashash from kuwait for his airbags which can be incorporated into shirts , jackets or suits , for motorcyclists .
a fair with international appeal the fair attracted inventors from all over the globe and has become very popular with some nations , in particular malaysia , russia , france and iran over its recent history .
the malaysians occupied around a quarter of the fair ’ s floor space , while 53 iranian exhibitors turned up after the iranian government decided to lend financial support to its delegation - last year , a local inventor returned with an award from the exhibition .
around two-thirds of the exhibitors were companies or institutes , with the remaining third made up of individual inventors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 donald fights the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi parody : huey , dewey and louie as boy scouts hitler 's " mein kampf " has surfaced in a new mickey mouse comic book - on the garbage heap .
and not for the first time , either .
disney comics frequently take ironic jabs at germany 's nazi past . in a heap along with a broken drum , an old tire and other garbage lies a green book , right where it belongs .
the title ?
" mein kampf . "
it 's just one inconspicuous detail in a new donald duck comic which came on the german market in time for april fool 's day . the story finds donald 's nephews , huey , dewey and louie , rummaging around in a garbage dump .
the balloon above hitler 's doctrine of hate reads : " they 're always good for an april fool 's joke . " " the story originated in 1948 , so you have to see it in its historical context , " said andreas platthaus , head of d.o.n.a.l.d , a german fan organization dedicated to the study of ' donaldism ' . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " de-nazified " version : in some editions , the book on the garbage heap bears the title " mein kampf . "
platthaus has combed through all the donald duck stories , looking for instances where the characters drag the nazis through the mud . sometimes , the originals have been retouched . but according to platthaus , " mein kampf " can also be found in the garbage dump in the american original .
" that the americans would joke about it is hardly surprising , " he said . the donald comics ' german translator , erika fuchs - who herself fled the nazis - would also often build in references , the donaldist said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once upon a time , donald spoke of the wehrmacht in this balloon - now he refers to the " pioneers . "
" for example , in ' die braven brückenbauer ' -lrb- the chickadee challenge -rrb- there 's a boy scouts leader who in one edition was a former employee with the german army , but in another edition , she 's a former restaurant employee , " said platthaus .
" there are at least two or three dozen nazi references in the donald duck stories " he estimated . need to laugh and in no way should they be interpreted as a glorification of the regime , stressed d.o.n.a.l.d 's president patrick martin . whether it is books added to a garbage heap or particularly authoritative structures in the boy scouts : " germany still has an unnatural way of dealing with the past .
poking fun in this way is important , because you have to be allowed to laugh about it - within limits , of course . " while the nazi jibes in the 1950 's-era comics are hidden in tiny details , disney cartoons made during world war ii often contained overt anti-nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald 's nephews say " hallo " where they once said " heil . "
" the most famous film is ' the fuehrer 's face ' from 1943 , " platthaus said .
" in it , donald duck dreams that he is an assembly-line worker in nazi germany , and is forced to salute the führer every time his picture appears .
in the last shot , you see him hugging the statue of liberty . " superworker ? other comic heroes were also called upon to battle the nazis during wartime . " of course there were comics where superman beats up hitler , " platthaus said .
looney tunes and warner brothers explored similar anti-nazi themes . comic propaganda even persisted during communist times in east germany , for example with the 1970 's-era series " fröhlich sein und singen " -lrb- be happy and sing -rrb- - albeit featuring specially-developed worker-hero characters . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do german workers really need a minimum wage ?
unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .

experts from the university of cologne launched a research project in 1963 to record the rock art by copying the drawings onto foils including the so-called white lady , a figure in white leggings carrying a lotus flower that is said to be 2,000 years old .
" the documentation in the form of copies of these unique pieces of ancient art in namibia will now find their place at the national archives of namibia , their natural home , " said university of cologne rector tassilo kupper at the opening of an international rock art conference in windhoek on monday .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.04.2005 the pros and cons of a minimum wage back to first page back 2/2 dw-world : there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .
i have complete faith in the german people , the german unions and other institutions that they will make a good decision for germany . michael knigge -lrb- tkw -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

are you for or against it ? john monks : we do n't represent one stance or the other in the european trade union confederation .
we have respected the special situation in germany and other northern countries in which wages are agreed by both employers and union representatives , rather than having a blanket minimum wage .
i come from britain , where we did n't have a minimum wage until 1998 .
but now that we do have one , i see its great advantages such as preventing employers from exploiting new workers and migrants . opponents to the minimum wage say rather than securing jobs in high-wage countries from the threat of cheap labor from eastern europe , it shifts jobs into low wage countries .
what is your opinion ? again , i can only stress the british example .
the level of the minimum wage is a very important factor .
if you have a minimum wage of say , 15 euros -lrb- $ 19 -rrb- , there would be a great danger that low-wage jobs would move to other countries .
there is a correct level and the british minimum wage is currently set at five pounds , which is just under eight euros , against a backdrop of falling unemployment .
some employers say it prompts employers to move jobs abroad , but all statistical evidence shows that if you find the right level for the minimum wage - and i do n't know what that would currently be in germany - it would not have a greatly negative impact on jobs . critics of the minimum wage say that minimum wage policies are nothing but protectionism against unwanted competition .
what do you say to that ? i think there are all kinds of societies in western europe which can be accused of protectionism .
but i actually believe that minimum wages , at least in britain - and i think it is similar in france and belgium - can be advantageous for foreign workers .
people who come from low-wage countries to those with normally much higher wages are extremely vulnerable - unless they are protected by a collective agreement or a powerful legal minimum wage machine .
i think minimum wages help to protect inhabitants from industrial countries and i do n't think it is protectionist .
the effect is almost entirely beneficial . what would you say to your german union friends if they were to ask for your advice ? i know my german union friends very well and they are able to form their own opinions on this subject without my advice .
but i shared my experience with them when britain shifted from a dismissive to a supportive attitude towards the minimum wage .
we are on the board which dictates the level of the minimum wage .
maybe germany can draw on some good advice if there is a decision to press ahead with a minimum wage .
i would say that if and when the time comes , it would be crucial to involve the unions in the whole process . do minimum wages in different countries really make any sense in this globalized world of ours ?
do we not at least need an eu-wide minimum wage for it to have any effect ? we would be doing the europeans a favor if we were to introduce a europe-wide minimum wage .
but realistically speaking , i think the differences between the countries are too great at the moment for that .
a minimum wage which would be acceptable in latvia would be too low for germany , and a sum which would work for slovakia would n't be enough for belgium .
at present the differences are simply too great for a harmonized minimum wage . one last question : if you had to vote on whether or not germany should have a minimum wage , how would you cast your ballot ? i 'm not german and therefore i do n't think i have the right to vote here .

unlike other eu countries , germany does not have a minimum wage .
dw-world talked to the head economist of barclays capital , thorsten polleit and general secretary of the european trade union confederation , john monks . dw-world .
there is heated debate in both germany and the european union about the minimum wage .
how worthwhile do you consider it to be ? thorsten polleit : when it comes to strengthening growth and employment across europe , the minimum wage is definitely the wrong instrument .
wages in parts of the continent are too high and minimum wages would not help to create much needed jobs in the low-wage areas . many politicians consider legally-binding minimum wages as a means of fighting wage dumping through workers from eastern europe .
how do you see that ? to refer to social dumping is to play with false morals .
we know that it is the consumer and those workers who are refused entry to the labor market who suffer from reducing competition through a minimum wage . cutting off the market would paralyze the most important sources of growth and employment .
with this in mind , it is misleading to make reference to social dumping . germany is one of very few industrial nations which does not have a minimum wage .
even exemplary countries such as the us , britain and the netherlands have had a minimum wage for many years .
why would it be such a bad thing for germany ? there are a number of countries which do n't have a minimum wage , and it is important to take into consideration the fact that wages in germany are already way above the average in other countries .
a minimum wage would deepen the gap in wage discrepencies . so would you say that the minimum wage kills jobs ? minimum wages clearly prohibit the less productive workers from getting onto the labor market .
this. in turn creates an increase in underemployment and the only way to solve that problem is with an open game of supply versus demand .
a minimum wage would n't help the situation . how would you suggest politicians go about creating more jobs ? we have to take into consideration that here in europe , not only in germany , we are in competition with many other nations such as india , china and other asian nations .
we also know that ultimately , affluence can only be created and maintained through the generation of better and cheaper solutions . we need less state intervention and more courage for reform , more courage for free market systems in europe . click on the second part to read what john monks thinks of a minimum wage . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

contrary to most other industrialised nations , germany does not have a fixed minimum wage .
the pro and contra camps are at loggerheads over the sense of introducing such a ruling . tradition in germany dictates that wage agreements are negotiated jointly by employers and unions .
but in reality this tradition has been steadily crumbling over the past years . in this age of a globalized economy , foreign workers who are willing and able to work for lower wages than their indigenous counterparts have been pushing their way onto the german market .
simultaneously there is increased pressure on companies to set up shop wherever production conditions are at their cheapest . construction ruling there might not be a legally binding minimum wage in germany , but the construction sector is governed by a fairly strict ruling .
since 1997 the rules of german construction workers ' contracts have also applied to employees of foreign companies working in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is some protection for construction workers in germany the ruling came about in response to foreign companies using their own teams of cheap laborers , thus giving them an advantage over german companies , causing prices to tumble and local workers to be squeezed further out of the employment frame .
in addition , working conditions for the foreign builders were not in keeping with germany 's social standards . in the european union , 18 of the 25 member states , including greece , spain , great britain and france have a minimum wage .
it is more often referred to in terms of a minimum monthly wage than a per hour rate , and there is a massive descrepancies from one end of the spectrum to the other . last year 's monthly rate for latvia was 116 euros -lrb- $ 150 -rrb- compared to 1369 euros in luxembourg .
advocates for the introduction of a minimum wage in germany argue from a platform of social justice and existential security .
but opponents to the plans say they would be counterproductive as jobs which pay less than the minimum wage would be cut , and unemployment would be pushed up even further .
the counter argument , however , is that the subsistence level in germany is secured through social welfare benefits and unemployment payments . monthly minimum wages - in euros , january 2003 belgium : 1163 greece : 605 spain : 526 france : 1154 ireland : 1073 luxembourg : 1369 netherlands : 1249 portugal : 416 united kingdom : 1105 bulgaria : 56 estonia : 138 lithuania : 125 latvia : 116 malta : 535 poland : 201 romania : 73 slovakia : 118 slovenia : 451 czech republic : 199 turkey : 89 hungary : 212 united states : 877 source : eurostat mik -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 donald fights the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi parody : huey , dewey and louie as boy scouts hitler 's " mein kampf " has surfaced in a new mickey mouse comic book - on the garbage heap .
and not for the first time , either .
disney comics frequently take ironic jabs at germany 's nazi past . in a heap along with a broken drum , an old tire and other garbage lies a green book , right where it belongs .
the title ?
" mein kampf . "
it 's just one inconspicuous detail in a new donald duck comic which came on the german market in time for april fool 's day . the story finds donald 's nephews , huey , dewey and louie , rummaging around in a garbage dump .
the balloon above hitler 's doctrine of hate reads : " they 're always good for an april fool 's joke . " " the story originated in 1948 , so you have to see it in its historical context , " said andreas platthaus , head of d.o.n.a.l.d , a german fan organization dedicated to the study of ' donaldism ' . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " de-nazified " version : in some editions , the book on the garbage heap bears the title " mein kampf . "
platthaus has combed through all the donald duck stories , looking for instances where the characters drag the nazis through the mud . sometimes , the originals have been retouched . but according to platthaus , " mein kampf " can also be found in the garbage dump in the american original .
" that the americans would joke about it is hardly surprising , " he said . the donald comics ' german translator , erika fuchs - who herself fled the nazis - would also often build in references , the donaldist said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once upon a time , donald spoke of the wehrmacht in this balloon - now he refers to the " pioneers . "
" for example , in ' die braven brückenbauer ' -lrb- the chickadee challenge -rrb- there 's a boy scouts leader who in one edition was a former employee with the german army , but in another edition , she 's a former restaurant employee , " said platthaus .
" there are at least two or three dozen nazi references in the donald duck stories " he estimated . need to laugh and in no way should they be interpreted as a glorification of the regime , stressed d.o.n.a.l.d 's president patrick martin . whether it is books added to a garbage heap or particularly authoritative structures in the boy scouts : " germany still has an unnatural way of dealing with the past .
poking fun in this way is important , because you have to be allowed to laugh about it - within limits , of course . " while the nazi jibes in the 1950 's-era comics are hidden in tiny details , disney cartoons made during world war ii often contained overt anti-nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald 's nephews say " hallo " where they once said " heil . "
" the most famous film is ' the fuehrer 's face ' from 1943 , " platthaus said .
" in it , donald duck dreams that he is an assembly-line worker in nazi germany , and is forced to salute the führer every time his picture appears .
in the last shot , you see him hugging the statue of liberty . " superworker ? other comic heroes were also called upon to battle the nazis during wartime . " of course there were comics where superman beats up hitler , " platthaus said .
looney tunes and warner brothers explored similar anti-nazi themes . comic propaganda even persisted during communist times in east germany , for example with the 1970 's-era series " fröhlich sein und singen " -lrb- be happy and sing -rrb- - albeit featuring specially-developed worker-hero characters . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .

it ’ s the latest in american imports that german commercial networks , desperately looking for ratings and cash , hope will save the day . everything 's perfect on wisteria lane .
the lawns are manicured and surrounded by white picket fences .
the suvs are tucked safely in their garages ; the swimming pools are always sparkling .
but behind the immaculate facades , life in this suburban idyll turns out to be , in part , a waking nightmare .
one woman gives up her high-powered career to raise children and bake cakes , and bitterly regrets it .
her ex-model neighbor ca n't endure the excruciating daytime boredom and begins a steamy affair with the gardener .
another stay-at-home mom steers her family onto the rocks with her martha stewart-style perfectionism . bildunterschrift : " desperate housewives " it 's all in a day , or episode , of " desperate housewives , " the surprise hit series for the american network abc that draws in 25 million viewers every sunday night .
the show , both a critical and commercial success in the us , has given long-struggling abc a new lease on life . germany 's commercial prosieben network wants a repeat of that story , badly . it has imported the series and dubbed it into german in record time .
it hopes - not quite desperately , but getting there - that " housewives " will pull the station out of the ratings doldrums and convince advertisers who have slashed their tv budgets over the past few years to come back to the fold . quality " made in usa " the series , which is being heavily promoted on billboards , in print and other media , is one more example of an american renaissance of sorts on the german tv landscape over the last few years .
in the fifties , sixties and seventies , television in germany was crowded with american imports . that fell off in the latter part of the 80s and 90s when german television production started coming into its own .
professional standards in germany increased , better scripts were written , and a home-grown tv culture began to take root .
american series were actually frowned upon in some quarters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but that has changed .
more recently , as german television viewers have become more sophisticated and ratings for german productions have dropped off , network heads are again looking back across the atlantic for a knight in shining armor .
while they are surely happy to satisfy germans ' desire for more quality tv , their primary goal is to save their own skins as well . " their survival depends on a recovery in the television market , even in the overall german consumer market , " said lutz erbring , a media studies professor at berlin 's free university . cash losses the german tv landscape is divided into two major camps , the commercial stations , such as prosieben , and the public broadcasters .
the latter group , which in germany includes two main national broadcasters along with regional stations , is financed by a fee that everyone owning a television or radio is obligated to pay .
the commercial stations get their revenue from advertising . that revenue stream , however , has been drying up .
between 2000 and 2003 , the advertising market in germany lost 3.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
once powerful commercial stations like rtl have watched ratings in the all-important 14- to 49-year-old group shrink from 21.2 percent to 16.8 percent over a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all of the commercial stations are looking for a way to lift these kinds of numbers , and the liferaft appears to be quality us programming , instead of home-grown formats .
" housewives " is meant to be the successor to the wildly successful run of " sex and the city " in germany , which spawned viewing parties in cities across the country and was able to convince wary advertisers to again take a chance on tv . other shows such as " six feet under " and " nip / tuck " have been brought over in the hopes that they 'd generate the same kind of excitement and revenue .
last week , the castaways on " lost " also made their german debut . " american tv culture itself has gone through an immensely interesting period , " said jo gröbel , director of the european institute for the media .
" there is a subtlety that you hardly ever see with german production . " germans behind the game indeed , some complain that german networks have to depend on foreign imports because their own domestic productions are weak , even though much of what actually airs on german screens are still copies of american or british shows .
while some work , many do n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tatort " on german public television there has been much hand-wringing in the press - some say overblown - about the decline of quality in german television .
critics argue executives are just playing it safe , afraid to take any kind of creative chance for fear of scaring off viewers .
they say that has lead to dull , predictable programming . others point to several recent embarrassing reality show productions when discussing german television 's slide .
one big brother-like show called " the castle " had a group of people living in medieval conditions .
its lowest point - among many low ones - was likely when one man urinated in another contestant 's bathwater while she was disrobing in the next room . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald schmidt such gimmicks have led one leading german tv personality , comedian harald schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to label the output of commercial stations " tv for the underclasses . " in search of … german networks are constantly on searching for scriptwriters who can write to the level of the best tv the us has to offer , although so far , most agree that only a very few shows , such as the detective series " tatort " or the lawyer drama " edel und starck , " can hold their own with quality american programming .
according to jo gröbel , the reason behind this is often , simply enough , money . " all these -lsb- us -rsb- series are immensely expensive productions .
a german tv producer would never reach the cost-benefit relation that those in the us can , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sex and the city cast : sarah jessica parker , kristin davis , cynthia nixon and kim cattrall -lrb- l-r -rrb- , photo the domestic market in the us is nearly four times larger than germany 's , and when potential global export revenue is taken into the equation , it is not difficult to see why american network executives are willing to lay out the kind of money they do for the expensive manhattan settings of " sex and the city " or the tropical island backdrop of " lost . " as far as talent goes , germany is not exactly lacking when it comes to television producers , although its history is shorter .
it only got started with serious production some 20 years ago , whereas the americans have been at it for almost three times that long .
and according to gröbel , statistically speaking , the us , with its larger population , has a larger pool of potential television production genius to pull from .
" but also the long tradition of supporting and honing this talent does n't exist in germany , " he added .
" maybe the obsession with the craft , the hunger , is more developed in the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.04.2005 donald fights the nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi parody : huey , dewey and louie as boy scouts hitler 's " mein kampf " has surfaced in a new mickey mouse comic book - on the garbage heap .
and not for the first time , either .
disney comics frequently take ironic jabs at germany 's nazi past . in a heap along with a broken drum , an old tire and other garbage lies a green book , right where it belongs .
the title ?
" mein kampf . "
it 's just one inconspicuous detail in a new donald duck comic which came on the german market in time for april fool 's day . the story finds donald 's nephews , huey , dewey and louie , rummaging around in a garbage dump .
the balloon above hitler 's doctrine of hate reads : " they 're always good for an april fool 's joke . " " the story originated in 1948 , so you have to see it in its historical context , " said andreas platthaus , head of d.o.n.a.l.d , a german fan organization dedicated to the study of ' donaldism ' . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " de-nazified " version : in some editions , the book on the garbage heap bears the title " mein kampf . "
platthaus has combed through all the donald duck stories , looking for instances where the characters drag the nazis through the mud . sometimes , the originals have been retouched . but according to platthaus , " mein kampf " can also be found in the garbage dump in the american original .
" that the americans would joke about it is hardly surprising , " he said . the donald comics ' german translator , erika fuchs - who herself fled the nazis - would also often build in references , the donaldist said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once upon a time , donald spoke of the wehrmacht in this balloon - now he refers to the " pioneers . "
" for example , in ' die braven brückenbauer ' -lrb- the chickadee challenge -rrb- there 's a boy scouts leader who in one edition was a former employee with the german army , but in another edition , she 's a former restaurant employee , " said platthaus .
" there are at least two or three dozen nazi references in the donald duck stories " he estimated . need to laugh and in no way should they be interpreted as a glorification of the regime , stressed d.o.n.a.l.d 's president patrick martin . whether it is books added to a garbage heap or particularly authoritative structures in the boy scouts : " germany still has an unnatural way of dealing with the past .
poking fun in this way is important , because you have to be allowed to laugh about it - within limits , of course . " while the nazi jibes in the 1950 's-era comics are hidden in tiny details , disney cartoons made during world war ii often contained overt anti-nazi propaganda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald 's nephews say " hallo " where they once said " heil . "
" the most famous film is ' the fuehrer 's face ' from 1943 , " platthaus said .
" in it , donald duck dreams that he is an assembly-line worker in nazi germany , and is forced to salute the führer every time his picture appears .
in the last shot , you see him hugging the statue of liberty . " superworker ? other comic heroes were also called upon to battle the nazis during wartime . " of course there were comics where superman beats up hitler , " platthaus said .
looney tunes and warner brothers explored similar anti-nazi themes . comic propaganda even persisted during communist times in east germany , for example with the 1970 's-era series " fröhlich sein und singen " -lrb- be happy and sing -rrb- - albeit featuring specially-developed worker-hero characters . rafael heiling -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .

it is being done in the name of anti-separatism and counter-terrorism , says a joint report by human rights watch and human rights in china .
it is said to be taking place in the western xinjiang region , where more than half the population is uighur .
china has denied that it suppresses islam in xinjiang .
it says it only wants to stop the forces of separatism , terrorism and religious extremism in the region , which uighur separatists call east turkestan .
detentions and executions the report accuses china of " opportunistically using the post-11 september environment to make the outrageous claim that individuals disseminating peaceful religious and cultural messages in xinjiang are terrorists who have simply changed tactics " .
china 's uighurs ethnically turkic muslims , mainly in xinjiang made bid for independent state in 1940s sporadic violence in xinjiang since 1991 uighurs worried about chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture the authors of the report say it is based on previously undisclosed communist party and chinese government documents , local regulations , press reports and local interviews .
the report says the systematic repression of religion in xinjiang was continuing as " a matter of considered state policy " .
such repression ranges from vetting imams and closing mosques to executions and the detention of thousands of people every year , it claims .
" religious regulation in xinjiang is so pervasive that it creates a legal net that can catch just about anyone the authorities want to target , " said sharon hom , executive director of human rights in china .
the report also reveals that almost half the detainees in xinjiang 's re-education camps are there for engaging in illegal religious activities .
uighurs make up about eight million of the 19 million people in xinjiang .
many of them favour greater autonomy , and china views separatist sentiments as a threat to the state .

or even a helicopter .
but , breakfast 's declan curry is covering the general election from a motorcycle side-car .
for the next few weeks , declan will be out on the road , finding out what really matters to ordinary voters across the uk .
he 's already nick-named his transport " the flying lozenge " .
and , he 's just filed this web-log , from his chichester , his third port of call on his uk tour : the old dear had been sickly for a few days .
but this morning , she got much worse .
frankly , it was not the news we wanted when we were talking about health .
despite some intensive care , our trusty motorbike simply refused to start .
a combination of the damp air at chichester 's marina and a weekend off the road left her incapable of anything more than a few feeble splutters .
it was all slightly embarrassing , as our last live broadcast of the morning was already underway and dermott and natasha were waving us off onto our next destination .
even a hefty push from two helpful ambulance men could n't coax her into life .
so , if a shove would n't work , the only option left was a tow .
the bike and sidecar were loaded up into a horse-box , and the entire contraption hooked onto the back of our team 's minibus .
meanwhile , our mystery driver sped off to a local diy store to look for a battery charger .
positive in the back of the bus , i caught up with your comments about the nhs .
health was our big topic of the day , and according to the opinion polls it 's the most important issue for more voters than any other .
a few weeks ago , we spent some time behind the scenes - and behind the screens - at st richard 's , the local hospital in chichester .
it 's seen as one of the best hospitals in the country .
many of you thought our film showed a very positive picture of the nhs ; too positive , according to some .
the hospital was clean , targets meant patients were treated more quickly , and extra funding was helping to deliver a better service .
but the message was more complex than all that .
the hospital 's chief executive also said the nhs will always demand more money , and we needed to make hard choices about what we should pay for - and what we should not .
antiseptic the senior casualty nurse said a & e targets were working , but only because the whole hospital had changed how it operated .
and the hospital was clean because antiseptic sprays had been installed by every door , and the chief housekeeper jill ruled her wards with a rod of iron .
and - as we said during the broadcasts - this was just one hospital 's story .
mrsa we also spoke to jacqui , whose father died at the start of this year in a surrey hospital .
she and her family were horrified by the lack of care for patients in that hospital ; she told us it needed many more staff on the wards .
we also heard from bill , who caught the hospital superbug in the early 1990s - when the conservatives were last in government .
he said many of the members of his mrsa support group did n't think things had improved under labour 's 8 years .
the argument over clean hospitals dominated your text messages and emails to us .
your views daniel in west sussex said his friend in hospital had not seen the floor cleaned in three days .
lucy in wakefield thinks some cleaners do n't know how to clean properly , and we should " bring in some of the old charwomen to show them how it 's done ! "
but why have there been more cases of mrsa infection in recent years ?
mike in oxford and chris in norwich both blame hospital staff , for wearing their uniforms outside the hospital .
barbara in kenilworth and peter in high wycombe said patients also shared some of the responsibility .
and what of the conservative promise - included in monday 's manifesto launch - to deliver cleaner wards by giving matron 's more power ?
hk ward in bristol wrote , " bringing back matrons will only add another layer of management . "
chris in tipton said , " we do n't need matrons to close down wards , we need more cleaners to make wards clean . "
many of you echoed jacqui 's concerns about the amount of care and attention patients get on hospital wards .
v. richards in dunstable said one of her friends had to be moved from an nhs ward to a private ward because the nurses were " far too overworked to give her any time and attention " .
jennie , emailing from the west midlands , said her mother had to wait for " 6 hours or more " in the emergency assessment unit of her local hospital .
and st richards in chichester - the hospital we visited - was criticised by several viewers , including amanda in midhurst who claimed staff showed her mother " no interest or kindness .
she fell and bruised herself badly . "
but other correspondents wanted to praise their local hospital .
harold in hextable said he and his wife got " quick and efficient " care in the darent valley hospital at dartford , also adding that it " sparkled with cleanliness " .
alan , who recently had a knee operation in nottingham , wondered why " isolated cases " are " taken as the criteria for treatment and cleanliness " .
linda in cirencester said she could not " speak more highly " of cirencester casualty unit .
and back in chichester , helen noted , " whatever it is that st richard 's does , other hospitals need to take note " .
that brings us back to a point raised by our guests after one of our broadcasts .
jacqui asked why the hospital that treated her father was not just as good at chichester 's .
angie suggested st richard 's is better run .
if that really is the answer - that the hospital has better management and its staff is more motivated - does n't that suggest some of that money we spend on " nhs bureaucrats " is more investment than waste ?
after all , we demand - and reward - top class managers at sainsbury , marks & spencer and bt .
why do n't we have the same attitude towards the nhs , which employs more staff than any of those big name companies ?
and where the results are much more vital ?

v. richards in dunstable said one of her friends had to be moved from an nhs ward to a private ward because the nurses were " far too overworked to give her any time and attention " .
jennie , emailing from the west midlands , said her mother had to wait for " 6 hours or more " in the emergency assessment unit of her local hospital .
and st richards in chichester - the hospital we visited - was criticised by several viewers , including amanda in midhurst who claimed staff showed her mother " no interest or kindness .
she fell and bruised herself badly . "
but other correspondents wanted to praise their local hospital .
harold in hextable said he and his wife got " quick and efficient " care in the darent valley hospital at dartford , also adding that it " sparkled with cleanliness " .
alan , who recently had a knee operation in nottingham , wondered why " isolated cases " are " taken as the criteria for treatment and cleanliness " .
linda in cirencester said she could not " speak more highly " of cirencester casualty unit .
and back in chichester , helen noted , " whatever it is that st richard 's does , other hospitals need to take note " .
that brings us back to a point raised by our guests after one of our broadcasts .
jacqui asked why the hospital that treated her father was not just as good at chichester 's .
angie suggested st richard 's is better run .
if that really is the answer - that the hospital has better management and its staff is more motivated - does n't that suggest some of that money we spend on " nhs bureaucrats " is more investment than waste ?
after all , we demand - and reward - top class managers at sainsbury , marks & spencer and bt .
why do n't we have the same attitude towards the nhs , which employs more staff than any of those big name companies ?
and where the results are much more vital ?

frankly , it was not the news we wanted when we were talking about health .
despite some intensive care , our trusty motorbike simply refused to start .
a combination of the damp air at chichester 's marina and a weekend off the road left her incapable of anything more than a few feeble splutters .
it was all slightly embarrassing , as our last live broadcast of the morning was already underway and dermott and natasha were waving us off onto our next destination .

health was our big topic of the day , and according to the opinion polls it 's the most important issue for more voters than any other .
a few weeks ago , we spent some time behind the scenes - and behind the screens - at st richard 's , the local hospital in chichester .
it 's seen as one of the best hospitals in the country .
many of you thought our film showed a very positive picture of the nhs ; too positive , according to some .
the hospital was clean , targets meant patients were treated more quickly , and extra funding was helping to deliver a better service .
but the message was more complex than all that .
the hospital 's chief executive also said the nhs will always demand more money , and we needed to make hard choices about what we should pay for - and what we should not .
antiseptic the senior casualty nurse said a & e targets were working , but only because the whole hospital had changed how it operated .
and the hospital was clean because antiseptic sprays had been installed by every door , and the chief housekeeper jill ruled her wards with a rod of iron .
and - as we said during the broadcasts - this was just one hospital 's story .
mrsa we also spoke to jacqui , whose father died at the start of this year in a surrey hospital .
she and her family were horrified by the lack of care for patients in that hospital ; she told us it needed many more staff on the wards .
we also heard from bill , who caught the hospital superbug in the early 1990s - when the conservatives were last in government .
he said many of the members of his mrsa support group did n't think things had improved under labour 's 8 years .
the argument over clean hospitals dominated your text messages and emails to us .
your views daniel in west sussex said his friend in hospital had not seen the floor cleaned in three days .
lucy in wakefield thinks some cleaners do n't know how to clean properly , and we should " bring in some of the old charwomen to show them how it 's done ! "
but why have there been more cases of mrsa infection in recent years ?
mike in oxford and chris in norwich both blame hospital staff , for wearing their uniforms outside the hospital .
barbara in kenilworth and peter in high wycombe said patients also shared some of the responsibility .
and what of the conservative promise - included in monday 's manifesto launch - to deliver cleaner wards by giving matron 's more power ?
hk ward in bristol wrote , " bringing back matrons will only add another layer of management . "

meanwhile , our mystery driver sped off to a local diy store to look for a battery charger .
positive in the back of the bus , i caught up with your comments about the nhs .
health was our big topic of the day , and according to the opinion polls it 's the most important issue for more voters than any other .
a few weeks ago , we spent some time behind the scenes - and behind the screens - at st richard 's , the local hospital in chichester .
it 's seen as one of the best hospitals in the country .
many of you thought our film showed a very positive picture of the nhs ; too positive , according to some .
the hospital was clean , targets meant patients were treated more quickly , and extra funding was helping to deliver a better service .
but the message was more complex than all that .
the hospital 's chief executive also said the nhs will always demand more money , and we needed to make hard choices about what we should pay for - and what we should not .
antiseptic the senior casualty nurse said a & e targets were working , but only because the whole hospital had changed how it operated .
and the hospital was clean because antiseptic sprays had been installed by every door , and the chief housekeeper jill ruled her wards with a rod of iron .
and - as we said during the broadcasts - this was just one hospital 's story .
mrsa we also spoke to jacqui , whose father died at the start of this year in a surrey hospital .
she and her family were horrified by the lack of care for patients in that hospital ; she told us it needed many more staff on the wards .
we also heard from bill , who caught the hospital superbug in the early 1990s - when the conservatives were last in government .
he said many of the members of his mrsa support group did n't think things had improved under labour 's 8 years .
the argument over clean hospitals dominated your text messages and emails to us .
your views daniel in west sussex said his friend in hospital had not seen the floor cleaned in three days .
lucy in wakefield thinks some cleaners do n't know how to clean properly , and we should " bring in some of the old charwomen to show them how it 's done ! "
but why have there been more cases of mrsa infection in recent years ?
mike in oxford and chris in norwich both blame hospital staff , for wearing their uniforms outside the hospital .
barbara in kenilworth and peter in high wycombe said patients also shared some of the responsibility .
and what of the conservative promise - included in monday 's manifesto launch - to deliver cleaner wards by giving matron 's more power ?
hk ward in bristol wrote , " bringing back matrons will only add another layer of management . "
chris in tipton said , " we do n't need matrons to close down wards , we need more cleaners to make wards clean . "
many of you echoed jacqui 's concerns about the amount of care and attention patients get on hospital wards .
v. richards in dunstable said one of her friends had to be moved from an nhs ward to a private ward because the nurses were " far too overworked to give her any time and attention " .
jennie , emailing from the west midlands , said her mother had to wait for " 6 hours or more " in the emergency assessment unit of her local hospital .
and st richards in chichester - the hospital we visited - was criticised by several viewers , including amanda in midhurst who claimed staff showed her mother " no interest or kindness .
she fell and bruised herself badly . "
but other correspondents wanted to praise their local hospital .
harold in hextable said he and his wife got " quick and efficient " care in the darent valley hospital at dartford , also adding that it " sparkled with cleanliness " .
alan , who recently had a knee operation in nottingham , wondered why " isolated cases " are " taken as the criteria for treatment and cleanliness " .
linda in cirencester said she could not " speak more highly " of cirencester casualty unit .
and back in chichester , helen noted , " whatever it is that st richard 's does , other hospitals need to take note " .
that brings us back to a point raised by our guests after one of our broadcasts .
jacqui asked why the hospital that treated her father was not just as good at chichester 's .
angie suggested st richard 's is better run .
if that really is the answer - that the hospital has better management and its staff is more motivated - does n't that suggest some of that money we spend on " nhs bureaucrats " is more investment than waste ?
after all , we demand - and reward - top class managers at sainsbury , marks & spencer and bt .
why do n't we have the same attitude towards the nhs , which employs more staff than any of those big name companies ?
and where the results are much more vital ?

only a few areas , including genetics and fertilisation , are not devolved .
the general election will be fought on a uk manifesto , with parties outlining health policies which could be irrelevant to wales .
but health is still likely to be a key issue for voters , and whoever wins power in westminster will need policies which work alongside the assembly .
waiting lists on welsh nhs total population -lrb- 2002 -rrb- - 2,918,700 people on hospital outpatient waiting lists - 219,600 people on hospital inpatient and day case waiting lists - 74,700 inpatients waiting more than a year - 8,500 source : welsh assembly health statistics 2004 voters are concerned about issues which directly affect them and , when at the ballot box , may not recognise the distinction between matters devolved to cardiff bay or decided at westminster .
the election of a government at westminster is certainly significant .
it is where the budget for the welsh assembly government - currently around £ 12 billion a year - is set .
health spending in wales - £ 4.9 billion - makes up the largest slice of this budget .
wales and westminster the health strategy of the assembly government has consistently ploughed a different furrow to successive uk secretaries of state .
department of health-led reforms concentrating on performance-managed waiting lists targets , star ratings , and foundation hospitals were rejected by the former welsh health minister jane hutt in favour of traditional , centrally-dictated policies run by 22 newly created local health boards .
first minister rhodri morgan has chosen to put " clear red water " between the assembly government and new labour in westminster .
chronic illness in wales around one million people in wales suffer from chronic -lrb- long-term -rrb- illness most common are back pain -lrb- 30 % -rrb- , arthritis -lrb- 25 % -rrb- , respiratory conditions -lrb- 23 % -rrb- and heart disease -lrb- 21 % -rrb- chronic illnesses account for more than 25 % of gp consultations in wales estimated that 80 % of all prescriptions are required to treat chronic conditions every year source : welsh assembly his vision is of a " health " rather than a " sickness " service , and encouraging health promotion , has been at the core of the assembly government 's policy .
labour has announced that more than £ 70m will be invested in health promotion by 2007-08 .
there are 62 projects across wales including one in ely , cardiff , where cardiff and vale nhs trust staff run a scheme to help patients at risk of heart disease .
specialist staff provide advice on lifestyle , smoking , diet and exercise , while participants take part in exercise glasses , gym work , stress management workshops and occupational therapy .
project coordinator cath washbrook said : " coronary heart disease is one of the biggest problems in the community and obesity is on the increase .
" health promotion needs to be kept at the top of the agenda to prevent the long-term health issues that come from poor lifestyle . "
waiting times observers have pointed to a change by the assembly government over the past 12 months , with waiting times made a more visible priority .
marcus longley , from the welsh institute of health and social care , told bbc radio wales : " when it came to power ... the main emphasis of the assembly government was improving people 's health and it almost seemed as though waiting times were a secondary issue .
waiting times are a key battleground in the health debate " we had a number of quite critical reports from the audit commission and others , and about 9-12 months ago there was a discernable shift as jane hutt , who was then the minister , appeared in public to recognise the fact that you could n't leave waiting lists on the back burner . "
the assembly government 's second offer scheme , introduced in april 2004 , gives patients with the longest waits the chance of treatment at a hospital elsewhere .
so far it says its provided more than 8,700 operations and the assembly government said the scheme had " made great strides in cutting long waits in wales " .
recent waiting list fall figures for the month ending february 2005 showed the number of patients waiting more than 12 months for admission to hospital as an inpatient or day case has fallen from 5,186 to 3,555 -lrb- 31.5 % -rrb- .
the number of people waiting more than 18 months for a first outpatient appointment fell from 5,485 to 3,381 -lrb- 38.4 % -rrb- .
people waiting more than 10 months for cardiac surgery fell by 12 to nine .
the number of people waiting more than 18 months for orthopaedic surgery fell by 17 to 15 .
source : welsh assembly the new health minister , brian gibbons , also announced new waiting time targets .
by 2009 , the maximum wait for patients from the time they visit the gp to having treatment will be 26 weeks - still higher than the 18-week target set for england by 2008 .
in february , the assembly government announced £ 32m in funding to tackle waiting lists .
but labour 's critics point to the disparity over waiting time figures with england and argue its stance has materially worsened the level of care provision in wales .
so how would the other parties tackle the problem ?
in march , plaid cymru published its 12-point action plan to improve waiting times and waiting lists .
its strategy would be to provide 500 additional beds in nhs hospitals and increase the number of intensive care beds by 50 .
brian gibbons took over as health minister from jane hutt the welsh liberal democrats have identified cutting waiting lists as a top priority .
the lib dems ' health plan includes setting up walk-in health centres , which already exist in england , and extending the second offer scheme to patients waiting longer than nine months .
the conservatives promised to use " spare capacity in english hospitals and the private sector to treat the enormous backlog of waiting patients " and would introduce walk-in centres in urban areas to relieve pressures on a & e departments .
