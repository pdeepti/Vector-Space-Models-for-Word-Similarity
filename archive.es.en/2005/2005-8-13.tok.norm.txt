the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .
some things have n't changed the beginning of george w. bush 's second term was marked by a conscious effort by new secretary of state condoleezza rice to improve the strained relations between the us and those europeans countries opposed to the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder after possibly his last visit to the white house as geman chancellor in june 2005 one area where germany and the us still do n't see eye to eye , however , is the environment .
america 's refusal to sign the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rubbed many germans , and particularly those in the green party , the wrong way .
the newest disagreement has been germany 's attempt to win a permanent seat on the un security council .
fischer , despite his efforts , was unable to win washington 's backing for the measure .
although the relationship between chancellor schröder and president bush has defrosted somewhat , during a visit to washington in june , schröder did not come away with the impression that bush would like to see him have a third term as chancellor .
" he did wish me luck in life , " said schröder later . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .
in clear weather you can even see the foothills of the black forest far off on the horizon . country clubs through the centuries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg 's university is over 600 years old the surroundings of the former capital of the electoral palatinate are certainly worth an excursion .
only a few miles to the southwest lies the castle schwetzingen , which was the summer residence of the palatinate electors in the eighteenth century .
forty rooms of the sumptuous palace are open for public viewing , but it is the masterful baroque palace garden that is the biggest draw of all . elector carl theodore had his 73-hectare -lrb- 180-acre -rrb- park embellished with temples , leafy arcades , and even a mosque .
at the time , oriental design was en mode .
nowadays the fashion is golf .
the country club st. leon-rot enjoys a worldwide reputation as a top golfer 's destination , and not just since tiger woods won the deutsche bank / sap open three times here . … … … five heidelberger musts the castle : over five centuries the wittelsbacher family of palatinate electors ruled from the safety of the heidelberg castle . among them was ruprecht i. , who in 1386 founded the eponymous university , germany 's first .
any visit to heidelberg today is incomplete without a visit to this impressive , medieval fortress . the university : heidelberg university is over six centuries old , although its main building today dates from 1712 .
for the 500th anniversary of its founding in 1885 , the interior of the old aula received a glorious renovation .
heidelberg student life was famously recorded by mark twain during his 1878 trip here in a tramp abroad . the philosopher 's path : from the philosopher 's path visitors can enjoy an expansive view over all of heidelberg from the same spots where hölderlin , goethe , or heidegger would take pause .
from here you can best view the " heidelberg trinity " of castle , river , and bridge . main street -lrb- die hauptstraße -rrb- : the pedestrian zone , which has been car-free for 29 years. is an ideal place to stroll and window shop , or stop in to any of the international boutiques . the old bridge -lrb- karl theodor brücke -rrb- : the old stone bridge spanning the neckar has become a symbol of heidelberg , even though it is relatively young in relation to the castle .
elector carl theodore had it built in 1786 to 1788 , a wise move given that the previous four bridges at this spot , all made of wood , had been destroyed by fires or floods .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .

he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .

while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 the rocky german-american landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder can smile together - only in front of cameras german-american relations have seldom experienced the strains that have developed during gerhard schröder 's time as chancellor .
the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .

but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " back to first page back 2/2 so are you sayi n g you wa n t to lead the spd back to its social democratic past , a n d the n you could imagi n e worki n g with them ? well i would say that oskar lafontaine maybe wants that more than me - he was once the spd leader , after all .
i was never a member of the spd .
but in terms of a coalition - that would be a prerequisite , yes .
because then we would have similar goals and we would be able to reach compromises together .
but when our goals are so different - how could you find any middle ground ? oskar lafo n tai n e is n ' t just a former spd leader - he 's also the declared arch-e n emy of cha n cellor schröder .
do you worry that you are just givi n g him the opportu n ity to take some ki n d of perso n al reve n ge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine hugs gerhard schröder after his election as chancellor in 1998 .
the two had a falling out soon after no , that does n't worry me .
gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .
oskar lafontaine knows that , too .
he knows that he probably wo n't even see schröder in parliament any more .
lafontaine knows that our new party - to the left of the social democrats - will be a significant political force .
and in years to come , we might be able to work with the spd if they return to their roots .
of course people might think there are other factors motivating oskar lafontaine - that 's perfectly legitimate .
who would n't think that ?
but in my opinion , it has very little to do with gerhard schröder any more . the east germa n sed became the sed-pds , the n the pds .
now it 's the left party .
what will you be called i n five years ? i honestly ca n't say .
because the truth is , we have not merged with the wasg in western germany .
the wasg has decided not to stand at the election .
we are standing .
i do n't want to go into the legal details right now .
but if we get into parliament - and i hope we will - then for the first time , we will have more members of parliament from the west than from the east .
for the other parties that 's perfectly normal - but not for mine .
these are new challenges .
in time , the leadership of the two parties will realize that the only sensible option is to merge .
and in 80 percent of our policies , that wo n't be a problem .
for 15 percent , some discussion will be needed .
and for 5 percent it will be really difficult .
but we 'll get there .
and then there will be a new name . which might be what ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and pds leader norbert bisky oh please do n't ask such difficult questions !
i think the main thing will be " the left . "
that 's easy to remember .
it 's what we 're already labeled as , and that 's fine .
at least you know then where you stand with us .
we certainly wo n't succumb to the ridiculous temptation to campaign as the party of the new center . christian f. trippe interviewed gregor gysi back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?

we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .

18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .
" it 's crazy … if i make a mistake here , rosicky is gone with the ball , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 the rocky german-american landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder can smile together - only in front of cameras german-american relations have seldom experienced the strains that have developed during gerhard schröder 's time as chancellor .
the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .
some things have n't changed the beginning of george w. bush 's second term was marked by a conscious effort by new secretary of state condoleezza rice to improve the strained relations between the us and those europeans countries opposed to the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder after possibly his last visit to the white house as geman chancellor in june 2005 one area where germany and the us still do n't see eye to eye , however , is the environment .
america 's refusal to sign the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rubbed many germans , and particularly those in the green party , the wrong way .
the newest disagreement has been germany 's attempt to win a permanent seat on the un security council .
fischer , despite his efforts , was unable to win washington 's backing for the measure .
although the relationship between chancellor schröder and president bush has defrosted somewhat , during a visit to washington in june , schröder did not come away with the impression that bush would like to see him have a third term as chancellor .
" he did wish me luck in life , " said schröder later . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .
for weeks , opinion polls have pointed to the likelihood that the party will become germany 's third-largest political party after the cdu and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . with its populist rhetoric , wacky economics and dangerously naïve attitudes toward foreign policy , it is certainly not in germany 's interest to have the left party do well in the upcoming vote .
but it is still seen by the majority of germans as the party with easterners ' interests most at heart . reinforcing bad perceptions stoiber 's little bout of ossi-bashing is only bound to reinforce the perception that many westerns consider easterners second-class citizens and help nurture an unhealthy chip on the shoulders of many in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east has n't rebounded yet .
as for his lament that those " frustrated " easterners could decide the election , well , i 've got news for you ed .
the frustrated decide every election .
and with unemployment in the formerly communist states double that in the west , eastern germans have plenty of reasons to be frustrated these days .
they will remain so until german politicians are able to tackle the problems that threaten to turn the region into a teutonic mezzogiorno . besides , stoiber should show a little more gratitude towards easterners .
bavaria , with its famously touted mix of " laptops and lederhosen , " might be doing just splendidly these days , but many of its top companies such as allianz and siemens only came to the state after they fled berlin after world war ii . if a good chunk of germany had n't been locked up behind the iron curtain for 40 years , bavaria might still be the farming backwater that it once was . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel aims to win back eastern voters chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .
his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls .

she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .
for weeks , opinion polls have pointed to the likelihood that the party will become germany 's third-largest political party after the cdu and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . with its populist rhetoric , wacky economics and dangerously naïve attitudes toward foreign policy , it is certainly not in germany 's interest to have the left party do well in the upcoming vote .
but it is still seen by the majority of germans as the party with easterners ' interests most at heart . reinforcing bad perceptions stoiber 's little bout of ossi-bashing is only bound to reinforce the perception that many westerns consider easterners second-class citizens and help nurture an unhealthy chip on the shoulders of many in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east has n't rebounded yet .
as for his lament that those " frustrated " easterners could decide the election , well , i 've got news for you ed .
the frustrated decide every election .
and with unemployment in the formerly communist states double that in the west , eastern germans have plenty of reasons to be frustrated these days .
they will remain so until german politicians are able to tackle the problems that threaten to turn the region into a teutonic mezzogiorno . besides , stoiber should show a little more gratitude towards easterners .
bavaria , with its famously touted mix of " laptops and lederhosen , " might be doing just splendidly these days , but many of its top companies such as allianz and siemens only came to the state after they fled berlin after world war ii . if a good chunk of germany had n't been locked up behind the iron curtain for 40 years , bavaria might still be the farming backwater that it once was . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel aims to win back eastern voters chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " back to first page back 2/2 so are you sayi n g you wa n t to lead the spd back to its social democratic past , a n d the n you could imagi n e worki n g with them ? well i would say that oskar lafontaine maybe wants that more than me - he was once the spd leader , after all .
i was never a member of the spd .
but in terms of a coalition - that would be a prerequisite , yes .
because then we would have similar goals and we would be able to reach compromises together .
but when our goals are so different - how could you find any middle ground ? oskar lafo n tai n e is n ' t just a former spd leader - he 's also the declared arch-e n emy of cha n cellor schröder .
do you worry that you are just givi n g him the opportu n ity to take some ki n d of perso n al reve n ge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine hugs gerhard schröder after his election as chancellor in 1998 .
the two had a falling out soon after no , that does n't worry me .
gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .
oskar lafontaine knows that , too .
he knows that he probably wo n't even see schröder in parliament any more .
lafontaine knows that our new party - to the left of the social democrats - will be a significant political force .
and in years to come , we might be able to work with the spd if they return to their roots .
of course people might think there are other factors motivating oskar lafontaine - that 's perfectly legitimate .
who would n't think that ?
but in my opinion , it has very little to do with gerhard schröder any more . the east germa n sed became the sed-pds , the n the pds .
now it 's the left party .
what will you be called i n five years ? i honestly ca n't say .
because the truth is , we have not merged with the wasg in western germany .
the wasg has decided not to stand at the election .
we are standing .
i do n't want to go into the legal details right now .
but if we get into parliament - and i hope we will - then for the first time , we will have more members of parliament from the west than from the east .
for the other parties that 's perfectly normal - but not for mine .
these are new challenges .
in time , the leadership of the two parties will realize that the only sensible option is to merge .
and in 80 percent of our policies , that wo n't be a problem .
for 15 percent , some discussion will be needed .
and for 5 percent it will be really difficult .
but we 'll get there .
and then there will be a new name . which might be what ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and pds leader norbert bisky oh please do n't ask such difficult questions !
i think the main thing will be " the left . "
that 's easy to remember .
it 's what we 're already labeled as , and that 's fine .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .
in clear weather you can even see the foothills of the black forest far off on the horizon . country clubs through the centuries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg 's university is over 600 years old the surroundings of the former capital of the electoral palatinate are certainly worth an excursion .
only a few miles to the southwest lies the castle schwetzingen , which was the summer residence of the palatinate electors in the eighteenth century .
forty rooms of the sumptuous palace are open for public viewing , but it is the masterful baroque palace garden that is the biggest draw of all . elector carl theodore had his 73-hectare -lrb- 180-acre -rrb- park embellished with temples , leafy arcades , and even a mosque .
at the time , oriental design was en mode .
nowadays the fashion is golf .
the country club st. leon-rot enjoys a worldwide reputation as a top golfer 's destination , and not just since tiger woods won the deutsche bank / sap open three times here . … … … five heidelberger musts the castle : over five centuries the wittelsbacher family of palatinate electors ruled from the safety of the heidelberg castle . among them was ruprecht i. , who in 1386 founded the eponymous university , germany 's first .
any visit to heidelberg today is incomplete without a visit to this impressive , medieval fortress . the university : heidelberg university is over six centuries old , although its main building today dates from 1712 .

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .
in clear weather you can even see the foothills of the black forest far off on the horizon . country clubs through the centuries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg 's university is over 600 years old the surroundings of the former capital of the electoral palatinate are certainly worth an excursion .
only a few miles to the southwest lies the castle schwetzingen , which was the summer residence of the palatinate electors in the eighteenth century .
forty rooms of the sumptuous palace are open for public viewing , but it is the masterful baroque palace garden that is the biggest draw of all . elector carl theodore had his 73-hectare -lrb- 180-acre -rrb- park embellished with temples , leafy arcades , and even a mosque .
at the time , oriental design was en mode .
nowadays the fashion is golf .
the country club st. leon-rot enjoys a worldwide reputation as a top golfer 's destination , and not just since tiger woods won the deutsche bank / sap open three times here . … … … five heidelberger musts the castle : over five centuries the wittelsbacher family of palatinate electors ruled from the safety of the heidelberg castle . among them was ruprecht i. , who in 1386 founded the eponymous university , germany 's first .
any visit to heidelberg today is incomplete without a visit to this impressive , medieval fortress . the university : heidelberg university is over six centuries old , although its main building today dates from 1712 .
for the 500th anniversary of its founding in 1885 , the interior of the old aula received a glorious renovation .

she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .
for weeks , opinion polls have pointed to the likelihood that the party will become germany 's third-largest political party after the cdu and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . with its populist rhetoric , wacky economics and dangerously naïve attitudes toward foreign policy , it is certainly not in germany 's interest to have the left party do well in the upcoming vote .
but it is still seen by the majority of germans as the party with easterners ' interests most at heart . reinforcing bad perceptions stoiber 's little bout of ossi-bashing is only bound to reinforce the perception that many westerns consider easterners second-class citizens and help nurture an unhealthy chip on the shoulders of many in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east has n't rebounded yet .

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .
in clear weather you can even see the foothills of the black forest far off on the horizon . country clubs through the centuries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg 's university is over 600 years old the surroundings of the former capital of the electoral palatinate are certainly worth an excursion .
only a few miles to the southwest lies the castle schwetzingen , which was the summer residence of the palatinate electors in the eighteenth century .
forty rooms of the sumptuous palace are open for public viewing , but it is the masterful baroque palace garden that is the biggest draw of all . elector carl theodore had his 73-hectare -lrb- 180-acre -rrb- park embellished with temples , leafy arcades , and even a mosque .

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .
in clear weather you can even see the foothills of the black forest far off on the horizon . country clubs through the centuries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg 's university is over 600 years old the surroundings of the former capital of the electoral palatinate are certainly worth an excursion .
only a few miles to the southwest lies the castle schwetzingen , which was the summer residence of the palatinate electors in the eighteenth century .
forty rooms of the sumptuous palace are open for public viewing , but it is the masterful baroque palace garden that is the biggest draw of all . elector carl theodore had his 73-hectare -lrb- 180-acre -rrb- park embellished with temples , leafy arcades , and even a mosque .

i was never a member of the spd .
but in terms of a coalition - that would be a prerequisite , yes .
because then we would have similar goals and we would be able to reach compromises together .
but when our goals are so different - how could you find any middle ground ? oskar lafo n tai n e is n ' t just a former spd leader - he 's also the declared arch-e n emy of cha n cellor schröder .

the two had a falling out soon after no , that does n't worry me .
gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .
oskar lafontaine knows that , too .
he knows that he probably wo n't even see schröder in parliament any more .
lafontaine knows that our new party - to the left of the social democrats - will be a significant political force .
and in years to come , we might be able to work with the spd if they return to their roots .
of course people might think there are other factors motivating oskar lafontaine - that 's perfectly legitimate .
who would n't think that ?
but in my opinion , it has very little to do with gerhard schröder any more . the east germa n sed became the sed-pds , the n the pds .
now it 's the left party .
what will you be called i n five years ? i honestly ca n't say .
because the truth is , we have not merged with the wasg in western germany .
the wasg has decided not to stand at the election .
we are standing .
i do n't want to go into the legal details right now .
but if we get into parliament - and i hope we will - then for the first time , we will have more members of parliament from the west than from the east .
for the other parties that 's perfectly normal - but not for mine .
these are new challenges .
in time , the leadership of the two parties will realize that the only sensible option is to merge .
and in 80 percent of our policies , that wo n't be a problem .
for 15 percent , some discussion will be needed .
and for 5 percent it will be really difficult .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .

dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .

how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?

yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .

only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

4 , 2005 -rrb- the comeback kid former spd chairman oskar lafontaine has had a tumultuous career in politics , withdrawing twice from the limelight in the past three decades .
but this pugnacious and passionate " napoleon " is back for his waterloo .
social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

un chief kofi annan now says finding a compromise will take longer than expected .
the plan pushed by germany is likely doomed . faced with an impasse over a proposed expansion of the un security council , secretary-general kofi annan was this week forced to concede that the contentious issue is unlikely to be settled before a summit of world leaders here in september . annan had made security council expansion a key plank of a sweeping un reform package to be ready for consideration by world leaders at a september 14-16 summit ahead of the general assembly session .
he had set a september deadline for agreement by member states . " i 'm one of those who believe that the reform of the united nations will not be complete without the reform of the security council , " the un chief said wednesday .
" so i would urge the member states to find a solution to this issue as soon as possible . " but a day later , annan appeared to bow to the political reality . " ideally , it should be done by september .
that was my own initial recommendation , " he said .
" but if that were to slip , i think the member states should remain focused , determined , and engaged , and try and do it by the end of the year because it is urgent . " us : no " artificial deadline " thursday , the new us ambassador to the un , john bolton , reaffirmed washington 's opposition to " an artificial deadline for possible changes to the security council . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un ambassador john bolton -lrb- right -rrb- with us president george w. bush " if you 're looking at the historical record , it would be hard to argue that putting any kind of deadline in place is necessarily conducive to success , " he added . the impasse over security council expansion is to a large extent due to the strong opposition by two veto-wielding permanent council members , china and the united states , to what had appeared to be the most promising proposal . more broadly , the united states wants the un to focus on management reform after a scandal over evidence of corruption in its oil-for-food program for iraq and widespread criticism of its structure and management practices . washington also wants to establish a panel to oversee peacekeeping missions , to reform the un human rights commission and exclude offending countries , and to set up a fund to promote democracy worldwide . g4 plan losing steam a draft resolution introduced in the general assembly by the so-called g4 - brazil , germany , india and japan - would boost council membership to 25 , with six new permanent non-veto-wielding seats - one for each of the so-called g4 members and two for africa - and four non-permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council washington instead would like to see only two permanent seats , including one for japan , and two or three non-permanent seats added to the council . china for its part is adamantly opposed to japan gaining a permanent seat , saying that tokyo must do more to show it regrets its militarist past . the g4 had hoped to enlist the backing of the 53-member african union to have any chance of securing the two-thirds majority in the 191-member general assembly for adoption of their draft . but at a recent summit in addis ababa , the africans refused to fall behind the g4 and instead stuck to their demand for veto power for the two seats to be allocated to africa . although it is backed by 30 countries , including council permanent members britain and france , the g4 proposal is now virtually doomed as it is also opposed by a group led by italy and canada that wants an enlarged council with 20 non-permanent members with no veto right along with the five veto-wielding permanent members . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us wary of german security council bid washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority .

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .

" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .

" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 13.08.2005 opinion : fear and loathing in bavaria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said not all germans were as smart as his fellow bavarians angela merkel hopes to become the first chancellor from eastern germany .
she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .
for weeks , opinion polls have pointed to the likelihood that the party will become germany 's third-largest political party after the cdu and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . with its populist rhetoric , wacky economics and dangerously naïve attitudes toward foreign policy , it is certainly not in germany 's interest to have the left party do well in the upcoming vote .
but it is still seen by the majority of germans as the party with easterners ' interests most at heart . reinforcing bad perceptions stoiber 's little bout of ossi-bashing is only bound to reinforce the perception that many westerns consider easterners second-class citizens and help nurture an unhealthy chip on the shoulders of many in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east has n't rebounded yet .
as for his lament that those " frustrated " easterners could decide the election , well , i 've got news for you ed .
the frustrated decide every election .
and with unemployment in the formerly communist states double that in the west , eastern germans have plenty of reasons to be frustrated these days .
they will remain so until german politicians are able to tackle the problems that threaten to turn the region into a teutonic mezzogiorno . besides , stoiber should show a little more gratitude towards easterners .
bavaria , with its famously touted mix of " laptops and lederhosen , " might be doing just splendidly these days , but many of its top companies such as allianz and siemens only came to the state after they fled berlin after world war ii . if a good chunk of germany had n't been locked up behind the iron curtain for 40 years , bavaria might still be the farming backwater that it once was . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel aims to win back eastern voters chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .
his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls .

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .

dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .

what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .

dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .

what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .

yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " back to first page back 2/2 so are you sayi n g you wa n t to lead the spd back to its social democratic past , a n d the n you could imagi n e worki n g with them ? well i would say that oskar lafontaine maybe wants that more than me - he was once the spd leader , after all .
i was never a member of the spd .
but in terms of a coalition - that would be a prerequisite , yes .
because then we would have similar goals and we would be able to reach compromises together .
but when our goals are so different - how could you find any middle ground ? oskar lafo n tai n e is n ' t just a former spd leader - he 's also the declared arch-e n emy of cha n cellor schröder .
do you worry that you are just givi n g him the opportu n ity to take some ki n d of perso n al reve n ge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine hugs gerhard schröder after his election as chancellor in 1998 .
the two had a falling out soon after no , that does n't worry me .
gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .
oskar lafontaine knows that , too .
he knows that he probably wo n't even see schröder in parliament any more .
lafontaine knows that our new party - to the left of the social democrats - will be a significant political force .
and in years to come , we might be able to work with the spd if they return to their roots .
of course people might think there are other factors motivating oskar lafontaine - that 's perfectly legitimate .
who would n't think that ?
but in my opinion , it has very little to do with gerhard schröder any more . the east germa n sed became the sed-pds , the n the pds .
now it 's the left party .
what will you be called i n five years ? i honestly ca n't say .
because the truth is , we have not merged with the wasg in western germany .
the wasg has decided not to stand at the election .
we are standing .
i do n't want to go into the legal details right now .
but if we get into parliament - and i hope we will - then for the first time , we will have more members of parliament from the west than from the east .
for the other parties that 's perfectly normal - but not for mine .
these are new challenges .
in time , the leadership of the two parties will realize that the only sensible option is to merge .
and in 80 percent of our policies , that wo n't be a problem .
for 15 percent , some discussion will be needed .
and for 5 percent it will be really difficult .
but we 'll get there .
and then there will be a new name . which might be what ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and pds leader norbert bisky oh please do n't ask such difficult questions !
i think the main thing will be " the left . "
that 's easy to remember .
it 's what we 're already labeled as , and that 's fine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 13.08.2005 opinion : fear and loathing in bavaria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber said not all germans were as smart as his fellow bavarians angela merkel hopes to become the first chancellor from eastern germany .
she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .
for weeks , opinion polls have pointed to the likelihood that the party will become germany 's third-largest political party after the cdu and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . with its populist rhetoric , wacky economics and dangerously naïve attitudes toward foreign policy , it is certainly not in germany 's interest to have the left party do well in the upcoming vote .
but it is still seen by the majority of germans as the party with easterners ' interests most at heart . reinforcing bad perceptions stoiber 's little bout of ossi-bashing is only bound to reinforce the perception that many westerns consider easterners second-class citizens and help nurture an unhealthy chip on the shoulders of many in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east has n't rebounded yet .
as for his lament that those " frustrated " easterners could decide the election , well , i 've got news for you ed .
the frustrated decide every election .
and with unemployment in the formerly communist states double that in the west , eastern germans have plenty of reasons to be frustrated these days .
they will remain so until german politicians are able to tackle the problems that threaten to turn the region into a teutonic mezzogiorno . besides , stoiber should show a little more gratitude towards easterners .
bavaria , with its famously touted mix of " laptops and lederhosen , " might be doing just splendidly these days , but many of its top companies such as allianz and siemens only came to the state after they fled berlin after world war ii . if a good chunk of germany had n't been locked up behind the iron curtain for 40 years , bavaria might still be the farming backwater that it once was . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel aims to win back eastern voters chancellor candidate angela merkel sought to distance herself from remarks made by her key ally in bavaria , edmund stoiber .
his comments on eastern voters are being linked to the conservatives ' slide in the polls .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .
some things have n't changed the beginning of george w. bush 's second term was marked by a conscious effort by new secretary of state condoleezza rice to improve the strained relations between the us and those europeans countries opposed to the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder after possibly his last visit to the white house as geman chancellor in june 2005 one area where germany and the us still do n't see eye to eye , however , is the environment .
america 's refusal to sign the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rubbed many germans , and particularly those in the green party , the wrong way .
the newest disagreement has been germany 's attempt to win a permanent seat on the un security council .
fischer , despite his efforts , was unable to win washington 's backing for the measure .
although the relationship between chancellor schröder and president bush has defrosted somewhat , during a visit to washington in june , schröder did not come away with the impression that bush would like to see him have a third term as chancellor .
" he did wish me luck in life , " said schröder later . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.08.2005 dfb wants turkish prodigy for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bvb 's sahin makes his presence felt at 16 years and 335 days when 16-year old nuri sahin took to the field last weekend for borussia dortmund , he became the youngest ever bundesliga player .
now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 the rocky german-american landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder can smile together - only in front of cameras german-american relations have seldom experienced the strains that have developed during gerhard schröder 's time as chancellor .
the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .
some things have n't changed the beginning of george w. bush 's second term was marked by a conscious effort by new secretary of state condoleezza rice to improve the strained relations between the us and those europeans countries opposed to the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder after possibly his last visit to the white house as geman chancellor in june 2005 one area where germany and the us still do n't see eye to eye , however , is the environment .
america 's refusal to sign the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rubbed many germans , and particularly those in the green party , the wrong way .
the newest disagreement has been germany 's attempt to win a permanent seat on the un security council .
fischer , despite his efforts , was unable to win washington 's backing for the measure .
although the relationship between chancellor schröder and president bush has defrosted somewhat , during a visit to washington in june , schröder did not come away with the impression that bush would like to see him have a third term as chancellor .
" he did wish me luck in life , " said schröder later . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

tourists just ca n't get enough of the castle ruins , the narrow alleys and historical flair . throngs of tourists stream through the slender streets of the old town and make their way up the steep incline to the heidelberg castle high above .
one hears a motley mix of languages : strains of english , japanese , and french commingle while video cameras hum , trying to capture all of the scenic beauty . cameras click , lenses aimed at the red sandstone castle , one of germany 's most photographed ruins .
year after year , the tourists come by the millions to old , romantic heidelberg . asparagus and philosophers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wander the streets of heidelberg and take in the colors heidelberg : the name itself conjures vivid images of the quintessential romantic german city .
the castle ruins tower above the old town , itself surrounded by lush green forests .
the river neckar flows by serenely by , its breadth spanned by a stately arched bridge from the middle ages . the old town , untouched by bombs in world war ii , lies picturesquely embedded in the gentle foothills of the odenwald forest .
the salubrious , nearly mediterranean climate allows the cultivation of asparagus and wine .
in heidelberg , nature and history , but also spirit and a lust for life come together in uncommon harmony . many a famous person has sojourned in this pretty city and more than a few renowned poets have been inspired by its wild-romantic scenery .
thinkers like johann wolfgang von goethe , clemens von brentano and josef von eichendorff ambled along the philosopher 's path in their day , one of europe 's loveliest hiking trails . after a steep climb , the walker is presented with a dramatic view over the valley , with the old town far below and the castle resting on the opposing hillside .
in clear weather you can even see the foothills of the black forest far off on the horizon . country clubs through the centuries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidelberg 's university is over 600 years old the surroundings of the former capital of the electoral palatinate are certainly worth an excursion .
only a few miles to the southwest lies the castle schwetzingen , which was the summer residence of the palatinate electors in the eighteenth century .
forty rooms of the sumptuous palace are open for public viewing , but it is the masterful baroque palace garden that is the biggest draw of all . elector carl theodore had his 73-hectare -lrb- 180-acre -rrb- park embellished with temples , leafy arcades , and even a mosque .
at the time , oriental design was en mode .
nowadays the fashion is golf .
the country club st. leon-rot enjoys a worldwide reputation as a top golfer 's destination , and not just since tiger woods won the deutsche bank / sap open three times here . … … … five heidelberger musts the castle : over five centuries the wittelsbacher family of palatinate electors ruled from the safety of the heidelberg castle . among them was ruprecht i. , who in 1386 founded the eponymous university , germany 's first .
any visit to heidelberg today is incomplete without a visit to this impressive , medieval fortress . the university : heidelberg university is over six centuries old , although its main building today dates from 1712 .
for the 500th anniversary of its founding in 1885 , the interior of the old aula received a glorious renovation .
heidelberg student life was famously recorded by mark twain during his 1878 trip here in a tramp abroad . the philosopher 's path : from the philosopher 's path visitors can enjoy an expansive view over all of heidelberg from the same spots where hölderlin , goethe , or heidegger would take pause .
from here you can best view the " heidelberg trinity " of castle , river , and bridge . main street -lrb- die hauptstraße -rrb- : the pedestrian zone , which has been car-free for 29 years. is an ideal place to stroll and window shop , or stop in to any of the international boutiques . the old bridge -lrb- karl theodor brücke -rrb- : the old stone bridge spanning the neckar has become a symbol of heidelberg , even though it is relatively young in relation to the castle .
elector carl theodore had it built in 1786 to 1788 , a wise move given that the previous four bridges at this spot , all made of wood , had been destroyed by fires or floods .
today the old bridge offers a fine view of the old town and the neckar landscape . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuschwanstein : mad ludwig 's magical refuge from reality no visit to germany would be complete without seeing the castle that inspired disney 's magical kingdom .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .
" it 's crazy … if i make a mistake here , rosicky is gone with the ball , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dortmund may need to sell star players are the vultures already circling troubled german soccer club borussia dortmund ?

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

the icy relations have thawed somewhat but differences of opinion remain . the first storm clouds appeared on the german-american horizon in may 2002 .
during george w. bush 's visit to germany , the us president was confronted with large crowds protesters who roundly jeered him .
it was a very different kind of reception than the ones his predecessors received .
george w. bush did express his appreciation for german support after the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , but that did little to quiet the angry voices that rose up in the street .
since 9/11 , bush had turned up the pressure on baghdad , calling the middle eastern state under saddam hussein a threat to the free world .
" i know that some people act as if the danger is not real , " bush said in berlin .
" i am saying that it is very real and a danger for everyone who loves freedom . "
harsh words from both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors carry a banner during a demonstration against us president bush in berlin in may 2002 the timing of the us threats toward iraq could n't have come at a more opportune time for schröder .
he made it a major issue in the general elections in september 2002 , saying that germany would not participate in an " adventure " in iraq .
in addition , the tone towards the germany 's once-close ally got increasingly harsher .
justice minister hertha däubler-gmelin 's even compared bush to adolf hitler , and promptly lost her job .
the reaction from the white house was one of outrage and even unbiased observers said the comment was uncalled for .
" that was a very dumb comment .
a grotesque exaggeration .
the angry reaction from the white house is , i think , in line .
i think this egregious comment will harm relations because bush takes something like that personally , " said the american professor for german history , gerald livingstone .
bildunterschrift : us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld divided europe into the " old " and the " new " despite däubler-gmelin 's resignation from the schröder administration , the reply from washington to the comparison came without delay from us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld .
while talking about opposition to a war , rumsfeld mentioned germany in the same breath as cuba and libya .
france was also not spared his vitriol .
" when you think of europe , you think of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's old europe , " the hawkish defense secretary said .
a time for war , a time for peace with rumsfeld 's comment , the apex of the verbal volleys across the atlantic had been reached .
with a firm hand , german foreign minister joschka fischer attempted to bring the matter to an end , telling all the parties involved to calm down .
the jabbing may have stopped , but the german government 's position did not change .
schröder and fischer refused to support the us in waging a war against saddam hussein .
bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan the hostility between the bush and schröder administrations has been more or less laid to rest by finding common ground , for example , germany 's presence in afghanistan .
even rumsfeld has rested his sharp tongue , saying relations between the two are not poisonous .
some things have n't changed the beginning of george w. bush 's second term was marked by a conscious effort by new secretary of state condoleezza rice to improve the strained relations between the us and those europeans countries opposed to the iraq war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schroeder after possibly his last visit to the white house as geman chancellor in june 2005 one area where germany and the us still do n't see eye to eye , however , is the environment .
america 's refusal to sign the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions rubbed many germans , and particularly those in the green party , the wrong way .
the newest disagreement has been germany 's attempt to win a permanent seat on the un security council .
fischer , despite his efforts , was unable to win washington 's backing for the measure .
although the relationship between chancellor schröder and president bush has defrosted somewhat , during a visit to washington in june , schröder did not come away with the impression that bush would like to see him have a third term as chancellor .
" he did wish me luck in life , " said schröder later . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder in washington to meet bush on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder is meeting us president george bush in the white house for talks on the situation in iraq and afghanistan , the developments in the middle east and the eu .

dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .

how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .

so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .

it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .

now the german national team wants to recuit him . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- want turkey 's under-17 international prodigy nuri sahin to play for their national team . last saturday borussia dortmund midfielder sahin became the youngest player to grace the bundesliga at the age of 16 years and 335 days and that has put germany on red alert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard mayer-vorfelder " we would like to invite nuri sahin to a training course with us , " declared dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder .
" the main condition for this is that he wants to play for germany .
he grew up in germany and learnt to play football here so why should he not play for germany ? " sahin was born in the small west german city of luedenscheid but played for turkey as they won the recent under-17 european championship .
" i was actually born in germany but feel more turkish , " said sahin . but if sahin obtains german citizenship before his 21st birthday and does not represent turkey at full international level , he would be permitted to choose between the two nations . germany have not been afraid of capping players from mixed backgrounds with many of jürgen klinsmann 's team born abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi and gerald asamoah are striking partners at club and international level schalke 04 marksman kevin kuranyi was born in rio and grew up in brazil while his schalke and germany striking partner gerald asamoah was born in mampong in ghana .
another germany forward , mirolsav klose , who has won a recall to the germany squad for the friendly against the netherlands this month , was born in opole , poland the interest in the young sahin caps an incredible week for the dortmunder . sahin admitted he was thrilled at writing himself into the bundesliga history books after becoming the youngest player to grace the german top-flight in last saturday 's 2-2 draw with vfl wolfsburg . at the age of 16 years and 335 days sahin eclipsed the previous record of eintracht frankfurt goalkeeper jürgen friedl , who made his bow at the age of 17 years and 26 days , and the young turk even had the honor of facing argentine international andres d 'alessandro in his first match . " i had goose bumps before the game but i would not say i was nervous , " said sahin .
" i think it was a decent performance on my bundesliga debut and facing d 'alessandro was a fantastic experience . " but i did not think about that too much .
as soon as you step on the pitch you block out everything else and focus on football . " bvb salivating over sahin 's talents sahin , voted best player at the last under-17 european championship , has given suffering dortmund fans something to cheer with bvb coach bert van marwijk describing him as one of the biggest talents he has ever seen .
" he plays as smart as a 24-year-old , almost as though he has played with us for a long time , " lauded van marwijk the coach is not the only member of the dortmund hierarchy who is salivating over the talents of the youngster . " he is the biggest talent that i 've seen in a long time , " said dortmund business manager hans-joachim watzke , who is determined to reverse bvb 's trend of buying stars in the hope of repeating its 1997 champions league triumph , a policy that contributed to dortmund 's near bankruptcy .
" the young players are our future and therefore wo n't be sold , " watzke added . the lesson of lars with all the praise heading his way , sahin will need tendering if he is to keep his feet on the ground .
but if the turk needs any warning that the flush of youth and the hype that follows precocious talents then he has only to look across the dressing room at former german international midfielder lars ricken . at the tender age of 17 ricken was hailed as the golden boy of german football after scoring a fantastic 30 meter lob to seal dortmund 's 3-1 champions league final win over juventus in 1997 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's lars ricken celebrates after scoring against schalke 04 last season .
ricken went on to play for the german national side but never really made an impact and at the age of 28 he is trying to resurrect his ailing career . sahin can not be labeled the golden boy of german football , mainly because he has a turkish passport , but vfl wolfsburg striker mike hanke insists people should not put too much pressure on the youngster 's shoulders .
" it is great to give young talent a chance , " explained hanke .
" but it would be unwise to put too much pressure on him -lrb- sahin -rrb- as there will be setbacks along the way . " the young turk 's impact on the game to date has not gone unnoticed .
english premiership giants arsenal recently had a 2.8 million euro bid for sahin turned down by dortmund even though the club has acute financial problems . coveted abroad , valued at dortmund unsurprisingly , sahin has also been picked up on the radar of chelsea , the english champions , and manchester united .
" we could have cashed in 3 million euros from arsenal for him , but sahin is tied to us until 2009 and in a couple of years he is sure to be worth a lot more , " hans-joachim watzke revealed last week . for now , the experience of turning out for bvb as the youngest ever bundesliga player is enough for sahin who has said he is just happy to be playing with the likes of czech internationals tomas rosicky and jan koller . bildunterschrift : dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller but the young star admits the speed of the game is very different to what he experienced on the dortmund youth team last season .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi wants new stock market speculation and wealth taxes germany 's new left party has been rising in the polls and is likely to enter germany 's parliament after elections scheduled for sept .
18 .
dw-tv spoke to gregor gysi , one of the party 's leaders , about his plans . dw-tv : mr. gysi , you 're 57 years old , you 're a solicitor , you were bor n i n berli n a n d after germa n u n ificatio n you ma n aged to tra n sform the east germa n communist party , the sed , i n to the party of democratic socialism , the pds .
now the pds has formed a n allia n ce with politicia n s who broke away from gerhard schröder 's gover n i n g social democratic party .
it is taki n g part i n the ge n eral electio n u n der the n ew n ame of " left party , " a n d almost out of n othi n g it has ma n aged to get 11 to 12 perce n t i n the opi n io n polls .
how do you explai n this light n i n g achieveme n t ? gregor gysi : well , it 's not yet an election result , but opinion polls , and i 'm cautious in these matters .
when german unification came many familiar institutions in east germany disappeared .
we knew that if we 'd dissolve the party as well , it would create an unmanageable chaos .
but what we achieved then always had one big flaw : we were seen as a political party which had its roots in communist east germany . now we 're in a situation where gerhard schröder and his spd have governed for seven years in a way which has willy-nilly created a new need for leftist politics in germany . many people understand that neo-liberalism can not be the solution to our problems . what does the left party have to offer people ?
after all , the spd did n ' t like to cut back o n the welfare state i n its seve n years of gover n me n t , but did it u n der great pai n s .
what makes you so sure that you ca n do better ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder after his speech to justify the vote of confidence he requested in parliament to trigger early elections on july 1 well , i ca n't see that gerhard schröder suffered many pains , he has always looked pretty cheerful , and others , too .
but if you tell me that you have seen them in agony , then i gladly take note of that . well , just look at the pai n ful struggle for reform . yes , there were some people who suffered .
but there were always the others , the protagonists of the neo-liberalist zeitgeist who said , " we can only revive the economy by cutting taxes for the rich and for big companies , and at the same time cutting back on the welfare state : cutting back on pensions and unemployment benefits and forcing the sick to pay more for the health service . "
we say : there is another way , and we prove its viability with examples like those of britain , sweden and other countries , and we say ' no ' to the reforms here .
only when we regain some social justice , more social welfare , more real wage increases , only then can the economy recover . but germa n y 's problem is that the welfare state has become too expe n sive .
a n d you have n ' t come up with a n a n swer to that , n amely how the left party would keep the welfare state goi n g , how it would pay for it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi 's party wants to tax speculation on the stock market well , you have n't asked me yet .
if you want to improve the welfare state you 'll have to raise the money .
so , we 've proposed a new tax system which would enlist the business world in a reasonable way , especially big business .
it means that we have to change our tax system .
we want to introduce a stock market speculation tax and a wealth tax .
we have worked it all out .
the accusation that medium incomes would be taxed most in our system is rubbish .
we have presented a tax system which would bring in at least 64 billion euros -lrb- $ 79.4 billion -rrb- a year .
and we need the money because otherwise we wo n't be able to improve the welfare state and reduce public debt in order to keep to the maastricht criteria .
so , i think there 's an exciting debate going on . you talk about oppositio n to the n eo-liberal mai n stream , oppositio n to cuts i n the welfare state .
but why o n ly oppositio n ?
do n ' t you wa n t to carry out these policies i n gover n me n t ? it 's not possible .
we ca n't realistically hope to win more than 50 percent of the votes . but you could aim for a coalitio n . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german welfare state suffer because of the fall of the berlin wall ?
yes - but who with ?
they are all basically neo-liberals .
you see , it would mean the spd would have to go through a process - presumably in opposition - of considering that their reform policies might have been wrong .
a new faction would have to emerge , to lead the party back to its social democratic roots .
i think that may well happen - but not this year .
what we need first of all is public debate of these issues - in the media as well .
i have the impression , talking to people in western germany that they think eastern germany is to blame for the scaling back of the welfare state .
and that hurts a little .
of course there were political , economic , moral and democratic reasons for the end of the soviet system .
but i got the impression that some people in the west now seem to be saying that the social welfare state was just a compromise , set up as a counter-balance to what was offered under communism - and that now we do n't need it any more .
and we have to do something against that . co n ti n ue readi n g to fi n d out more about gysi 's visio n s for his party 's future . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " back to first page back 2/2 so are you sayi n g you wa n t to lead the spd back to its social democratic past , a n d the n you could imagi n e worki n g with them ? well i would say that oskar lafontaine maybe wants that more than me - he was once the spd leader , after all .
i was never a member of the spd .
but in terms of a coalition - that would be a prerequisite , yes .
because then we would have similar goals and we would be able to reach compromises together .
but when our goals are so different - how could you find any middle ground ? oskar lafo n tai n e is n ' t just a former spd leader - he 's also the declared arch-e n emy of cha n cellor schröder .
do you worry that you are just givi n g him the opportu n ity to take some ki n d of perso n al reve n ge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine hugs gerhard schröder after his election as chancellor in 1998 .
the two had a falling out soon after no , that does n't worry me .
gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .
oskar lafontaine knows that , too .
he knows that he probably wo n't even see schröder in parliament any more .
lafontaine knows that our new party - to the left of the social democrats - will be a significant political force .
and in years to come , we might be able to work with the spd if they return to their roots .
of course people might think there are other factors motivating oskar lafontaine - that 's perfectly legitimate .
who would n't think that ?
but in my opinion , it has very little to do with gerhard schröder any more . the east germa n sed became the sed-pds , the n the pds .
now it 's the left party .
what will you be called i n five years ? i honestly ca n't say .
because the truth is , we have not merged with the wasg in western germany .
the wasg has decided not to stand at the election .
we are standing .
i do n't want to go into the legal details right now .
but if we get into parliament - and i hope we will - then for the first time , we will have more members of parliament from the west than from the east .
for the other parties that 's perfectly normal - but not for mine .
these are new challenges .
in time , the leadership of the two parties will realize that the only sensible option is to merge .
and in 80 percent of our policies , that wo n't be a problem .
for 15 percent , some discussion will be needed .
and for 5 percent it will be really difficult .
but we 'll get there .
and then there will be a new name . which might be what ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and pds leader norbert bisky oh please do n't ask such difficult questions !
i think the main thing will be " the left . "
that 's easy to remember .
it 's what we 're already labeled as , and that 's fine .
at least you know then where you stand with us .
we certainly wo n't succumb to the ridiculous temptation to campaign as the party of the new center . christian f. trippe interviewed gregor gysi back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " lafontaine is not a german haider " how strong is germany 's new leftist alliance ?

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 13.08.2005 " we ca n't realistically hope to win " back to first page back 2/2 so are you sayi n g you wa n t to lead the spd back to its social democratic past , a n d the n you could imagi n e worki n g with them ? well i would say that oskar lafontaine maybe wants that more than me - he was once the spd leader , after all .
i was never a member of the spd .
but in terms of a coalition - that would be a prerequisite , yes .
because then we would have similar goals and we would be able to reach compromises together .
but when our goals are so different - how could you find any middle ground ? oskar lafo n tai n e is n ' t just a former spd leader - he 's also the declared arch-e n emy of cha n cellor schröder .
do you worry that you are just givi n g him the opportu n ity to take some ki n d of perso n al reve n ge ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine hugs gerhard schröder after his election as chancellor in 1998 .
the two had a falling out soon after no , that does n't worry me .
gerhard schröder has been on his way out since the north rhine-westphalia election .
oskar lafontaine knows that , too .
he knows that he probably wo n't even see schröder in parliament any more .
lafontaine knows that our new party - to the left of the social democrats - will be a significant political force .
and in years to come , we might be able to work with the spd if they return to their roots .
of course people might think there are other factors motivating oskar lafontaine - that 's perfectly legitimate .
who would n't think that ?
but in my opinion , it has very little to do with gerhard schröder any more . the east germa n sed became the sed-pds , the n the pds .
now it 's the left party .
what will you be called i n five years ? i honestly ca n't say .
because the truth is , we have not merged with the wasg in western germany .
the wasg has decided not to stand at the election .
we are standing .
i do n't want to go into the legal details right now .
but if we get into parliament - and i hope we will - then for the first time , we will have more members of parliament from the west than from the east .
for the other parties that 's perfectly normal - but not for mine .
these are new challenges .
in time , the leadership of the two parties will realize that the only sensible option is to merge .
and in 80 percent of our policies , that wo n't be a problem .
for 15 percent , some discussion will be needed .
and for 5 percent it will be really difficult .
but we 'll get there .
and then there will be a new name . which might be what ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi and pds leader norbert bisky oh please do n't ask such difficult questions !

she still might , despite a clumsy campaign .
but no thanks to her fellow conservative bavarian premier edmund stoiber , says dw-world 's marc young . if some bavarians still wondered why the rest of germany does n't much like them , smooth-talking eddie stoiber probably cleared up any remaining confusion last week . in spectacularly offensive fashion , stoiber first attacked the allegedly dangerous influence of eastern german voters on the election outcome .
the failed conservative candidate for chancellor in 2002 said at a campaign rally he could n't abide the possibility that scruffy , " frustrated " easterners would end up deciding the election - as they did to his detriment last time around . stoiber then promptly followed up that gaffe by lamenting at another gathering that other germans lacked the intelligence of his fellow bavarians .
apparently , he was referring to the kind of intelligence that 's kept his party in power in the southern conservative stronghold for the past 60 years .
but the monotony of the democratic process in bavaria is a topic for another day . stoiber 's comments , understandably , unleashed a nationwide storm of outrage .
leaders across the political spectrum were united in their rejection of his assertion that easterners , or ossis , as they 're disparagingly known in germany , were unable to make an informed decision once inside the voting booth on september 18 . officials from his own christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party tried to explain stoiber had been misunderstood and that the " frustrated " he had referred to were the leaders of a successful new far-left party - imaginatively named the left party - and not easterners at large . clumsy conservatives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wait , you mean she 's an ossi ?
a few people might buy that line , but clear damage had been done to the conservatives ' clumsy campaign .
struggling with her own gaffes , angela merkel 's presence on the campaign trail has been less than steady of late .
and now stoiber 's comments have been dropped into the middle of an already contentious debate about the rift between eastern and western germany with all the subtlety of a hydrogen bomb . earlier this month , easterners were insulted by remarks from brandenburg 's conservative interior minister , jörg schönbohm .
he posited the bizarre theory that somehow the legacy of east germany 's brutal totalitarian regime was responsible for a clearly mentally disturbed woman who repeatedly committed infanticide . merkel , aware that offending a large section of the electorate is n't the best campaign strategy , has gone into full damage-control mode .
but her credibility with many easterners may already be stretched beyond repair .
despite her years growing up in the east , many there feel she betrayed her ossi roots to have a successful wessi career with the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . helping the wrong people of course , the most irksome thing about the repeated missteps by the conservatives is not that it imperils the cdu 's own share of the vote , but rather that comment 's like stoiber 's are a sure-fire way to push disgruntled easterners into the arms of the anti-reform left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party hopes to pick socialism up off the floor .
formed from an alliance between the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- – which itself was born from the ashes of the east german communist party – and some old-school western trade unionists , the left party looks set to become a pan-german socialist success .
for weeks , opinion polls have pointed to the likelihood that the party will become germany 's third-largest political party after the cdu and chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . with its populist rhetoric , wacky economics and dangerously naïve attitudes toward foreign policy , it is certainly not in germany 's interest to have the left party do well in the upcoming vote .
but it is still seen by the majority of germans as the party with easterners ' interests most at heart . reinforcing bad perceptions stoiber 's little bout of ossi-bashing is only bound to reinforce the perception that many westerns consider easterners second-class citizens and help nurture an unhealthy chip on the shoulders of many in the region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east has n't rebounded yet .

back a single issue fanatically ?
feel uncomfortable in big groups ?
why not found your own political party .
it 's fun ; it 's doable ; and it makes for some interesting ads on television during campaign season . voters tired of government in general can go to the polls in likely elections on september 18 and cast their ballot for the anarchist pogo party .
those wanting a return to strict judeo-christian values can throw their support behind the party of bible-faithful christians .
they 're just two of the 34 political parties that have been cleared by the federal election commission to join the campaign that 's beginning to heat up .
the eight parties that are now sitting in state and federal parliaments all got the green light on friday , but so did 26 smaller political grouping that reveal a vibrancy , and dash of weirdness , in germany 's political culture that is often overlooked , since the big guys get all the press .
bildunterschrift : the big four parties there are the single-issue campaigners , like the pro dm party , which hates the euro and wants to go back to the good old days of the deutschmark .
they 'll need a bit of luck , though , and are n't expected to pass the five-percent hurdle required to make it into parliament .
parties like the gray panthers and the animal protection party give a voice to fairly powerful minority groupings and while they also generally do n't make it into legislating chambers , they do have an influence on lawmakers .
the panthers in particular , which represent the interests of older germans , could find themselves gaining in strength as germany 's population continues to age .
other groups seem somewhat outdated , like the marxist-leninist party , or simply puzzling , like a party calling itself the party of work , the constitutional state , animal protection , promotion of elites and grassroots democratic initiative .
it was founded by the staff of a satirical magazine and says it wants to rebuild the berlin wall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign poster for the bible-based party since the approved parties are all guaranteed tv time on germany 's public stations , in the weeks leading up to the elections viewers will likely see some interesting ads .
some , like ones produced in the past by the above-mentioned marxists , seem like a blast from the past , with a young woman raising her fist and decrying the imperialists .
ads by others reveal that although they 've been approved for the election , their production budgets are pretty small . but not every party which wants to can stand in the elections and there were several which did not get approval .
the party representing the sorb minority in eastern germany did n't make the cut , while the german communist party pulled their application at the last minute .
and a few of the , well , more imaginative organizations were politely turned down , such as the bears for germany , the global future party , and the decidedly new age-sounding group calling itself spiritual consciousness . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " read a selection of our " and finally ...

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .

the widely accepted instigator , arsenal shot-stopper lehmann , has always claimed that he is the rightful number one , not the incumbent , bayern 's khan . what started out as a well-publicized moan about not being in the team back in february of last year soon escalated into a full-blown row that dragged in german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer and kahn 's team chief at the time , ottmar hitzfeld . the controversy started after germany stumbled towards the ultimately disastrous euro 2004 campaign .
lehmann gave an interview with german soccer magazine kicker in which he criticized oliver kahn 's performances in the qualifiers and stated that he is the best german goalkeeper and should replace kahn in the national team . lehmann claims to be the best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the better player has to play , " germany 's number two was quoted at the time .
" my performances are more consistent .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " lehmann and kahn have made no secret of the fact that they do n't get on and refuse to speak to each other .
" i did n't know we were supposed to talk , " lehmann said last year at the height of the public spat .
" i do n't have a 24-year-old girlfriend .
i have a different life . "
his comments referred to kahn 's affair in 2004 with a munich barmaid that started when his wife was pregnant and made headlines in germany for weeks .
the pair eventually split . jens lower than a snakes belly , says wounded kahn kahn retaliated while playing the role of victim : " i am deeply hurt by lehmann 's statements , " he told reporters .
" lehmann can believe what he wants .
i ’ ve never needed to stoop to such a level as it sometimes appears -lrb- in the kicker article -rrb- .
what you read can sometimes be incredible , but everyone can decide for themselves how low they want to go .
this is as low as it can get . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ lehmann can ’ t cope with being the number two , he doesn ’ t seem to be able to live with it , ” added kahn who plans to carry on until the 2006 world cup finals on home soil . the severity of the row even reached the upper echelons of the sport with bayern president and german world cup statesman franz beckenbauer joining in , unsurprisingly , on the side of his team 's number one .
" lehmann 's statements are cheeky , uncooperative and in bad taste , " said the world cup-winning captain and coach . hildebrand brands oli " immature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tensions between the keepers were exacerbated towards the end of 2004 when number three goalie hildebrand threw in his two cents worth claiming kahn should be showing more maturity on the pitch at 35 .
kahn was blasted for a fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose last season , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker . " you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . " hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is widely assumed by both fans and critics to be the natural successor to both lehmann and kahn and has regularly been voted as the best german keeper by soccer magazines in the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de old war horses return as young colts rest waves of anxiety rippled through germany 's soccer community on wednesday when coach jürgen klinsmann announced that his two youngest stars would not be in his latest squad .

the facsimile copy of the lindisfarne gospels will spend the next five weeks at killhope , the north of england lead mining museum , in upper weardale .
the gospels were produced around 715-720 ad by eadfrith , bishop of lindisfarne , and are regarded as one of the most important books in history .
they detail the rise of a coherent british society around the legend of st cuthbert , patron saint of northumbria .
the original gospels are in the british library despite an ongoing campaign to return them to the north east .
' breathtaking artwork ' they were written in latin on 259 leaves of vellum , using around 150 expensive cattle hides .
killhope visitor services officer shelagh connor said : " the lindisfarne gospels is one of the world 's greatest books and a significant surviving treasure of early christianity .
" interest in this state-of-the-art copy from the british library has been amazing wherever it has been on show and latest research shows there may be quite a close link between the lindisfarne gospels and the weardale area .
" originally , it was thought some of the inks used in the original came from afghanistan but now , after more research , it 's thought that the red-orange colour used in the breathtaking artwork comes from toasted lead found around this area . "

harman , 32 , is quitting by " mutual , amicable decision " with producers , an eastenders spokesman said .
he will make his final appearance on the bbc soap at the end of the year , when dean - a founding cast member - will take an extended break .
" we do not know when she will come back , but she will return , " the spokesman said .
soap marriage harman 's character dennis is due to marry his adopted sister sharon on the bbc one soap later this month .
their wedding will coincide with the discovery of the body of murdered character den watts - dennis ' father and sharon 's adoptive father - who was played by leslie grantham .

north wales police deputy chief clive wolfendale said he feared the problem will worsen when longer licensing hours are brought in later this year .
mr wolfendale added that binge drinking was already a bigger challenge to police than terrorism .
but rob hayward , from the british beer and pub association , said that pub prices were not the only issue .
" the big issue in terms of alcohol pricing is to do with supermarkets rather than pubs , " he said .
the sight of young men and women urinating the street , fighting paralytic in the gutter is not part of a civilised society clive wolfendale mr wolfendale said he enjoyed a drink " as much as the next person " and said " an extension of licensing hours in a civilised society ought to be possible " .
" but the reality is that our culture and heritage of excessive drinking , combined with the relatively cheap price of alcohol these days means this is definitely a recipe for real problems on our streets , " he said .
" there are minor assaults , serious assaults , there are murders committed simply because people are under the influence of alcohol - it is a national disgrace . "
he said the idea for trebling drink prices came from scandinavia , where alcohol is considerably more expensive .
" i know it would n't be popular ... but for me this is the single most impactive thing that could be done currently to curtail the problem , " he said .

" many town centres are effectively no-go areas after 10 o 'clock at night , and simply the sight of young men and women urinating the street , fighting paralytic in the gutter is not part of a civilised society .
" i think it is time we all stood firm and said enough is enough . "
aneurin owen , director of cais , the drug and alcohol agency for wales , agreed that raising the price would have an influence on how much people drank .
" whether we go up to three times the current level i am not quite sure , but i think there is a case for the chancellor to take the opportunity at the budget to put up alcohol slowly over time , " he said .
he said that behaviour and the attitudes to alcohol needed to change .
