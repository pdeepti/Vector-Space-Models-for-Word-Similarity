poles responded with humor , but say that attitudes have n't changed much towards the new eastern eu members . the french “ non ” campaign was specific : a yes vote means the “ polish plumber ” will take french jobs .
but these days , annoyed with the negative image of eastern europeans portrayed by richer western eu countries , poles have come up with a creative way to fight back .
hence the hunky polish plumber , beckoning visitors to poland .
“ i am remaining in poland , ” reads the ad featuring a blond , well-built man , created by the polish tourist board .
“ come visit . ”
“ we didn ’ t agree with the negative image of poles used during the campaign , ” said katarzyna gubois of the polish tourist board in paris .
“ we wanted to show something else of poland and tell people they are welcome to visit our country . ”
schizophrenic view poles and other new eastern members of the european union have often been seen as second class citizens of europe , say poles .

“ on one hand , they treat us as if we don ’ t exist .
on the other hand , we are seen as a threat , taking their land , autos , jobs . ” sabine woelker , an expert on polish-german relations for the german council on foreign relations in berlin says that negative stereotypes of poland and its eastern neighbors still exist but are changing slowly . “ poles are still seen as coming into germany illegally , working as construction workers or cleaners , ” she said .
“ the idea still exists that poles are lazy , that one has to watch their valuables around them , and people still joke about how risky it is to take one ’ s car to poland .
but this is changing as german employers see that poles are very flexible , work well and are worth their wages . ” those stereotypes frustrate ordinary poles who have lived in western europe , particularly younger , more educated ones . “ i got tired of being looked down on , being viewed with suspicion ” said one pole , a government auditor from warsaw who spent time in a german government ministry during an exchange program .
“ we are not all housecleaners or plumbers or car thieves . ” defying stereotypes these days , more than a year after joining the club , poles – who are usually the most negatively stereotyped by western countries - are fighting clichés with the ad campaign and defying them with success . for example , the polish economy is one of the fastest growing ones in the eu .

the country , which still receives millions of euros in subsidies from the eu , became a net development aid donor to poorer nations in asia and africa for the first time this year , according to the united nations development program .

this is going to the major factor in how western countries view the east in the future , says one labor ministry official in warsaw . “ the french and german politicians played on people ’ s fears of losing their jobs , ” the official said .

poles responded with humor , but say that attitudes have n't changed much towards the new eastern eu members . the french “ non ” campaign was specific : a yes vote means the “ polish plumber ” will take french jobs .
but these days , annoyed with the negative image of eastern europeans portrayed by richer western eu countries , poles have come up with a creative way to fight back .
hence the hunky polish plumber , beckoning visitors to poland .
“ i am remaining in poland , ” reads the ad featuring a blond , well-built man , created by the polish tourist board .
“ come visit . ”
“ we didn ’ t agree with the negative image of poles used during the campaign , ” said katarzyna gubois of the polish tourist board in paris .
“ we wanted to show something else of poland and tell people they are welcome to visit our country . ”
schizophrenic view poles and other new eastern members of the european union have often been seen as second class citizens of europe , say poles .

“ on one hand , they treat us as if we don ’ t exist .
on the other hand , we are seen as a threat , taking their land , autos , jobs . ” sabine woelker , an expert on polish-german relations for the german council on foreign relations in berlin says that negative stereotypes of poland and its eastern neighbors still exist but are changing slowly . “ poles are still seen as coming into germany illegally , working as construction workers or cleaners , ” she said .
“ the idea still exists that poles are lazy , that one has to watch their valuables around them , and people still joke about how risky it is to take one ’ s car to poland .
but this is changing as german employers see that poles are very flexible , work well and are worth their wages . ” those stereotypes frustrate ordinary poles who have lived in western europe , particularly younger , more educated ones . “ i got tired of being looked down on , being viewed with suspicion ” said one pole , a government auditor from warsaw who spent time in a german government ministry during an exchange program .
“ we are not all housecleaners or plumbers or car thieves . ” defying stereotypes these days , more than a year after joining the club , poles – who are usually the most negatively stereotyped by western countries - are fighting clichés with the ad campaign and defying them with success . for example , the polish economy is one of the fastest growing ones in the eu .
it grew by more than five percent last year .
the country , which still receives millions of euros in subsidies from the eu , became a net development aid donor to poorer nations in asia and africa for the first time this year , according to the united nations development program .

this is going to the major factor in how western countries view the east in the future , says one labor ministry official in warsaw . “ the french and german politicians played on people ’ s fears of losing their jobs , ” the official said .

germany has questioned a british proposal that the g8 nations double their development aid .
chancellor schröder 's africa advisor said that a sudden increase in foreign aid to african countries would be counterproductive . leaders at the upcoming g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland will also be discussing how to help africa defeat poverty and embark on a journey of rapid growth .
britain is expected to put forward a plan envisaging the doubling of development aid to africa to $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.6 billion euros -rrb- in the near future .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's advisor on africa policy , uschi eid , said the plan does not come at the right time .
" without strong institutions and professional capacities , a doubling of aid is not very useful , " eid said .
" of course , we want to double development assistance to africa .
but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work and to make sure the necessary infrastructure is put in place . "
eid was speaking after a meeting with wiseman nkuhlu , the executive director of africa 's homegrown nepad initiative , in berlin on monday .
fragile reforms in africa founded in 2001 , nepad aims to revitalize the continent 's ailing economy by attracting private investors with progress in conflict resolution and improved transparency .
the organization received full backing from the group of eight in 2002 and pledges from rich countries to support the initiative with billions of dollars in financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack of clean water is a major problem in developing countries eid said that enormous progress had been made in a number of countries under the nepad initiative .
germany 's plan to double aid to africa in the next 10 years , she said , was better suited to achieve the ambitious goals in health , education and poverty reduction .
but nkuhlu disagreed .
" i 'm convinced that there 's a large number of african countries that can absorb increased levels of development assistance , " nkuhlu said .
he said it was critical that industrialized nations strongly aid those countries that are making progress .
" but the reforms in a number of countries in africa are still very fragile because the majority of african countries are too poor to really deliver on promises to their people , " he added .
better access to markets nkuhlu said he hoped that the issue of increased assistance would be on the agenda in gleneagles regardless of the resistance of some industrialized countries .
he said it was now critically important that the g8 pledged further support for the reform process in africa .
" the question of access to markets is also critical , " nkuhlu said .
" africa needs to increase production .
that 's a major issue in terms of progress . "
germany has supported nepad with 2.5 billion euros over the past three years .
it is especially active in the field of conflict resolution , promoting good governance , water management and private sector investment .
the german government , however , wants to see greater progress in the field of political reforms and democracy .
eid praised nepad 's peer review mechanism under which african countries assess each other 's performance in these areas .
she stressed , though , that recent delays in the publication of the first national reports regarding ghana and rwanda must be made up for quickly . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin have brushed back charges from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

he said it was now critically important that the g8 pledged further support for the reform process in africa .

germany has questioned a british proposal that the g8 nations double their development aid .
chancellor schröder 's africa advisor said that a sudden increase in foreign aid to african countries would be counterproductive . leaders at the upcoming g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland will also be discussing how to help africa defeat poverty and embark on a journey of rapid growth .
britain is expected to put forward a plan envisaging the doubling of development aid to africa to $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.6 billion euros -rrb- in the near future .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's advisor on africa policy , uschi eid , said the plan does not come at the right time .
" without strong institutions and professional capacities , a doubling of aid is not very useful , " eid said .
" of course , we want to double development assistance to africa .

but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .

over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .
the attitude of the 1950s kassel 's pedestrian zone , the treppenstrasse , opened in 1953 and quickly became a national attraction .
in the same year , stuttgart and kiel began building car-free shopping areas and over the next few years , most other german cities followed suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most pedestrian zones are packed with shoppers on the weekend often , existing streets were simply blocked for cars and made into pedestrian zones .
but in kassel , this area was designed solely for this purpose , with a combination of simple architecture , fountains and green spaces , reminiscent of the postwar german 's idea of a mediterranean piazza .
" it is n't bombastic , but rather has a lightness , charm and liveliness to it , like the attitude to life in the 1950s , " said christian kopetzki , a professor of urban planning at the university of kassel .
" it was so to speak a reflex to overcome the horrors before it .
you find that in that architecture . "
from a pretty girl to an aging matron today , the concrete is slowly crumbling .
the architecture appears somewhat stale and the store areas are too small for the shopping adventure these days , said kassel optician hans uwe hess .

but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .
maybe they had their first kiss on a warm summer evening at the fountain along the quiet cobblestone streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people often beg in pedestrian zones but now , in economically difficult times , their atmosphere has suffered and these car-free areas appear dreary and shabby .
junk and penny pincher shops are driving out long-established stores , with homeless people meeting in front of the town hall for their first beer at ten in the morning .
creating a modern city the pedestrian zone was born in the central german city of kassel .

the technology is daunting , but if it works , scientists say the world will benefit from a source of energy that will be cheap , clean , safe and almost infinite .
for years , the six iter partners - the eu , the united states , russia , japan , south korea and china - had wrangled over which country would get to host the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- project .
they finally reached an agreement after japan withdrew its bid , settling on moscow and beijing 's preferred site , cadarache , france .

" i can not explain how this blunder came about , " pfahls , who is also a former head of the german domestic intelligence agency , told the court .
" i somehow got caught up in things . " bribes and gun-running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfahls is actually on trial over a separate affair .
he is accused of taking nearly two million euros in bribes for the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia in 1991 , and failing to declare the earnings . the presiding judge at the court in the southern city of augsburg , maximilian hofmeister , said pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession . " this will not be a short trial , " hofmeister said .

" i can not explain how this blunder came about , " pfahls , who is also a former head of the german domestic intelligence agency , told the court .
" i somehow got caught up in things . " bribes and gun-running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfahls is actually on trial over a separate affair .
he is accused of taking nearly two million euros in bribes for the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia in 1991 , and failing to declare the earnings . the presiding judge at the court in the southern city of augsburg , maximilian hofmeister , said pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession .

germany is the biggest single contributor to isa .
some 2,000 of the 8,300 troops on the ground there are german . dw-world spoke with commander roland vogler-wander , the bundeswehr 's spokesman in kunduz .
dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .
what normally takes place in such an action ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers marching in afghanistan the arms are laid out , registered , and loaded onto the truck .
anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck visited kabul in 2002 it is risky if the munitions are n't properly stored .
for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?
we live here in a camp with 300 people .
we are always together .
we eat together , we work together , we have leisure time together .
losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .
i knew the people who died and the ones who were injured .
i spoke with them frequently .
it certainly does affect one personally .
what will the consequences be for the bundeswehr after the accident ?
we have to live with the fact that there is a certain amount of risk involved .
as soldiers , we know that and we are trained for it .
we are prepared for the fact , and defense minister struck has also clearly said , that we have to be ready to accept the fact that in this deployment , a soldier can lose his life .
what other conditions make this a difficult deployment ?
the climate .
its almost 50 degrees here right now .
the bad roads and the infrastructure make it difficult .
but i prefer to see these difficulties as challenges .
what is the biggest challenge ?
in my view ?
that we reach our goal , which is to help the afghan government to achieve stability .

" there are no indications of an attack and we continue to assume it was an accident , " struck told reporters at the time .
yet the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which the soldiers were part of , requested an investigation to rule out a deliberate attack .
a report is due by the end of the week on the deaths of the soldiers , who were part of an isaf contingent observing ammunition-sorting operations .
germany is the biggest single contributor to isa .
some 2,000 of the 8,300 troops on the ground there are german . dw-world spoke with commander roland vogler-wander , the bundeswehr 's spokesman in kunduz .
dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .
what normally takes place in such an action ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers marching in afghanistan the arms are laid out , registered , and loaded onto the truck .
anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck visited kabul in 2002 it is risky if the munitions are n't properly stored .
for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?
we live here in a camp with 300 people .
we are always together .
we eat together , we work together , we have leisure time together .
losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .
i knew the people who died and the ones who were injured .
i spoke with them frequently .
it certainly does affect one personally .
what will the consequences be for the bundeswehr after the accident ?
we have to live with the fact that there is a certain amount of risk involved .
as soldiers , we know that and we are trained for it .
we are prepared for the fact , and defense minister struck has also clearly said , that we have to be ready to accept the fact that in this deployment , a soldier can lose his life .
what other conditions make this a difficult deployment ?
the climate .
its almost 50 degrees here right now .
the bad roads and the infrastructure make it difficult .
but i prefer to see these difficulties as challenges .
what is the biggest challenge ?
in my view ?
that we reach our goal , which is to help the afghan government to achieve stability .
i think we 're on the right path . interview conducted by christiane wolters -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

but when it comes to making millions from tv rights , the top soccer league is languishing when compared to its european counterparts . the study by global auditor ernst & young , which surveyed managers of both the clubs in the bundesliga as well as the second division soccer league in germany , predicted that both would face a rosier economic future over the next few years thanks to rising revenues and sinking costs . presented in frankfurt on monday , the survey found that club managers rated the current financial situation much more positively than last year .
two-thirds of those polled expected a better fiscal result for the 2004/2005 season and 53 percent said they were counting on soaring revenues in the coming season .
most of the hopes are pinned on sponsorship deals : 64 percent said they expected incomes to rise in that area . tv rights hampering earnings at the same time , the survey singled out television broadcast rights for putting a brake on otherwise much higher dividends for germany 's top soccer clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard snapped up all the rights to the bundesliga last year for a pittance the rather meager revenues from television rights as compared with other european top-flight leagues , could in future seriously endanger the sports quality of the bundesliga , the study warned , adding that it could turn the german top league into a financial straggler on an international level . the study 's pessimism is lent credence by estimates that cash flows from television rights in the coming season will bring the 36 bundesliga clubs a total of around 195 million euros -lrb- $ 237.086 million -rrb- .
in comparison , britain 's premier league receives over 710 million euros , the italian and french leagues 550 million euros each . a break down of those figures by a further estimation show that the italian top soccer league champion can count on 111 million euros from its national tv broadcast deals in the next season , while the german champ will have to contend with a mere 16 million euros . fans must begin paying to watch the main reason for the relatively low dividends from television broadcast rights is the low penetration of pay-tv in germany . the possibility of seeing bundesliga highlights on saturday evenings on the hugely popular sportschau program on free public service broadcaster ard has drastically reduced the attractiveness of premiere , the only pay-tv channel in germany , the study said . " at the same time significant revenue hikes can only be possible via pay-tv , " said arnd hovemann of ernst & young .
" the german television viewers have to change their viewing habits , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching bundesliga highlights is a free affair in germany he added that the average german tv viewer still had a paradisiacal situation when it came to program offerings and speedy match coverage , referring to the sportschau on free-tv .
hovemann however said that paradise would have to end and fans would have to pay to watch , stressing that they would be compensated for it by increased quality in the bundesliga . that stance was echoed by karl-heinz rummenigge , a former national player and current executive chairman of bayern munich , who lashed out last month at the ard 's " it 's-cool-to-be-stingy " price for snapping up broadcasting rights for the bundesliga last year and the widespread popularity of its sportschau program in germany . in an interview with newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , rummenigge admitted that the weekly sportschau served its purpose well and was good and serious in its reporting , but added that the ard had to ready to dig much deeper into its pockets if the bundesliga was to remain competitive and retain top-notch players .

" more business savvy needed however , the soccer researchers are clear that even if the television deal for the 2006/2007 season significantly increased revenues , the earnings of top german clubs would still be nowhere close to their european counterparts .
that 's because of skewed revenue distribution rules in germany among the soccer clubs which are not in direct proportion to a club 's performance on the field . " the bundesliga has to decide whether it wants to cling to the principle of solidarity or whether it wants to retains financial competition among the top german club on a european level by changing current distribution rules , " hovemann said .
" both are n't possible . " the study also advises the top clubs to roll back costs in the short term , particularly on personnel and player transfers .
much like before , most clubs are outfitted with too little personal capital , the study said , adding that many still boast intangible assets such as players with high market value and club brands . most clubs in germany are also moving away from traditional bank loans and looking at alternative ways to finance themselves , according to the study . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de borussia on the brink borussia dortmund , germany 's only publicly listed soccer club , said thursday it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.06.2005 german soccer not on the ball financially großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching this in the stadium costs , but on german tv it does n't germany 's bundesliga may face a brighter economic future , says a new study .
but when it comes to making millions from tv rights , the top soccer league is languishing when compared to its european counterparts . the study by global auditor ernst & young , which surveyed managers of both the clubs in the bundesliga as well as the second division soccer league in germany , predicted that both would face a rosier economic future over the next few years thanks to rising revenues and sinking costs . presented in frankfurt on monday , the survey found that club managers rated the current financial situation much more positively than last year .
two-thirds of those polled expected a better fiscal result for the 2004/2005 season and 53 percent said they were counting on soaring revenues in the coming season .
most of the hopes are pinned on sponsorship deals : 64 percent said they expected incomes to rise in that area . tv rights hampering earnings at the same time , the survey singled out television broadcast rights for putting a brake on otherwise much higher dividends for germany 's top soccer clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard snapped up all the rights to the bundesliga last year for a pittance the rather meager revenues from television rights as compared with other european top-flight leagues , could in future seriously endanger the sports quality of the bundesliga , the study warned , adding that it could turn the german top league into a financial straggler on an international level . the study 's pessimism is lent credence by estimates that cash flows from television rights in the coming season will bring the 36 bundesliga clubs a total of around 195 million euros -lrb- $ 237.086 million -rrb- .
in comparison , britain 's premier league receives over 710 million euros , the italian and french leagues 550 million euros each . a break down of those figures by a further estimation show that the italian top soccer league champion can count on 111 million euros from its national tv broadcast deals in the next season , while the german champ will have to contend with a mere 16 million euros . fans must begin paying to watch the main reason for the relatively low dividends from television broadcast rights is the low penetration of pay-tv in germany . the possibility of seeing bundesliga highlights on saturday evenings on the hugely popular sportschau program on free public service broadcaster ard has drastically reduced the attractiveness of premiere , the only pay-tv channel in germany , the study said . " at the same time significant revenue hikes can only be possible via pay-tv , " said arnd hovemann of ernst & young .
" the german television viewers have to change their viewing habits , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching bundesliga highlights is a free affair in germany he added that the average german tv viewer still had a paradisiacal situation when it came to program offerings and speedy match coverage , referring to the sportschau on free-tv .
hovemann however said that paradise would have to end and fans would have to pay to watch , stressing that they would be compensated for it by increased quality in the bundesliga . that stance was echoed by karl-heinz rummenigge , a former national player and current executive chairman of bayern munich , who lashed out last month at the ard 's " it 's-cool-to-be-stingy " price for snapping up broadcasting rights for the bundesliga last year and the widespread popularity of its sportschau program in germany . in an interview with newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , rummenigge admitted that the weekly sportschau served its purpose well and was good and serious in its reporting , but added that the ard had to ready to dig much deeper into its pockets if the bundesliga was to remain competitive and retain top-notch players . " with this -lrb- financial -rrb- game that we 're playing here , television is undoubtedly an important pillar , " rummenige said .
" it 's always nice to say that the fan wants to see his sportschau at 8.15 p.m.
but then somebody has to tell me how we 're going to finance this place here .

but when it comes to making millions from tv rights , the top soccer league is languishing when compared to its european counterparts . the study by global auditor ernst & young , which surveyed managers of both the clubs in the bundesliga as well as the second division soccer league in germany , predicted that both would face a rosier economic future over the next few years thanks to rising revenues and sinking costs . presented in frankfurt on monday , the survey found that club managers rated the current financial situation much more positively than last year .
two-thirds of those polled expected a better fiscal result for the 2004/2005 season and 53 percent said they were counting on soaring revenues in the coming season .
most of the hopes are pinned on sponsorship deals : 64 percent said they expected incomes to rise in that area . tv rights hampering earnings at the same time , the survey singled out television broadcast rights for putting a brake on otherwise much higher dividends for germany 's top soccer clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard snapped up all the rights to the bundesliga last year for a pittance the rather meager revenues from television rights as compared with other european top-flight leagues , could in future seriously endanger the sports quality of the bundesliga , the study warned , adding that it could turn the german top league into a financial straggler on an international level . the study 's pessimism is lent credence by estimates that cash flows from television rights in the coming season will bring the 36 bundesliga clubs a total of around 195 million euros -lrb- $ 237.086 million -rrb- .
in comparison , britain 's premier league receives over 710 million euros , the italian and french leagues 550 million euros each . a break down of those figures by a further estimation show that the italian top soccer league champion can count on 111 million euros from its national tv broadcast deals in the next season , while the german champ will have to contend with a mere 16 million euros . fans must begin paying to watch the main reason for the relatively low dividends from television broadcast rights is the low penetration of pay-tv in germany . the possibility of seeing bundesliga highlights on saturday evenings on the hugely popular sportschau program on free public service broadcaster ard has drastically reduced the attractiveness of premiere , the only pay-tv channel in germany , the study said . " at the same time significant revenue hikes can only be possible via pay-tv , " said arnd hovemann of ernst & young .
" the german television viewers have to change their viewing habits , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching bundesliga highlights is a free affair in germany he added that the average german tv viewer still had a paradisiacal situation when it came to program offerings and speedy match coverage , referring to the sportschau on free-tv .
hovemann however said that paradise would have to end and fans would have to pay to watch , stressing that they would be compensated for it by increased quality in the bundesliga . that stance was echoed by karl-heinz rummenigge , a former national player and current executive chairman of bayern munich , who lashed out last month at the ard 's " it 's-cool-to-be-stingy " price for snapping up broadcasting rights for the bundesliga last year and the widespread popularity of its sportschau program in germany . in an interview with newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , rummenigge admitted that the weekly sportschau served its purpose well and was good and serious in its reporting , but added that the ard had to ready to dig much deeper into its pockets if the bundesliga was to remain competitive and retain top-notch players . " with this -lrb- financial -rrb- game that we 're playing here , television is undoubtedly an important pillar , " rummenige said .
" it 's always nice to say that the fan wants to see his sportschau at 8.15 p.m.
but then somebody has to tell me how we 're going to finance this place here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , far right , the bayern boss added that boosting pay-tv was of utmost importance .

" there are no indications of an attack and we continue to assume it was an accident , " struck told reporters at the time .
yet the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which the soldiers were part of , requested an investigation to rule out a deliberate attack .

germany is the biggest single contributor to isa .
some 2,000 of the 8,300 troops on the ground there are german . dw-world spoke with commander roland vogler-wander , the bundeswehr 's spokesman in kunduz .
dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .
what normally takes place in such an action ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers marching in afghanistan the arms are laid out , registered , and loaded onto the truck .
anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck visited kabul in 2002 it is risky if the munitions are n't properly stored .
for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?
we live here in a camp with 300 people .
we are always together .
we eat together , we work together , we have leisure time together .
losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .
i knew the people who died and the ones who were injured .
i spoke with them frequently .
it certainly does affect one personally .
what will the consequences be for the bundeswehr after the accident ?
we have to live with the fact that there is a certain amount of risk involved .
as soldiers , we know that and we are trained for it .
we are prepared for the fact , and defense minister struck has also clearly said , that we have to be ready to accept the fact that in this deployment , a soldier can lose his life .
what other conditions make this a difficult deployment ?
the climate .
its almost 50 degrees here right now .
the bad roads and the infrastructure make it difficult .

in comparison , britain 's premier league receives over 710 million euros , the italian and french leagues 550 million euros each . a break down of those figures by a further estimation show that the italian top soccer league champion can count on 111 million euros from its national tv broadcast deals in the next season , while the german champ will have to contend with a mere 16 million euros . fans must begin paying to watch the main reason for the relatively low dividends from television broadcast rights is the low penetration of pay-tv in germany . the possibility of seeing bundesliga highlights on saturday evenings on the hugely popular sportschau program on free public service broadcaster ard has drastically reduced the attractiveness of premiere , the only pay-tv channel in germany , the study said . " at the same time significant revenue hikes can only be possible via pay-tv , " said arnd hovemann of ernst & young .
" the german television viewers have to change their viewing habits , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching bundesliga highlights is a free affair in germany he added that the average german tv viewer still had a paradisiacal situation when it came to program offerings and speedy match coverage , referring to the sportschau on free-tv .
hovemann however said that paradise would have to end and fans would have to pay to watch , stressing that they would be compensated for it by increased quality in the bundesliga . that stance was echoed by karl-heinz rummenigge , a former national player and current executive chairman of bayern munich , who lashed out last month at the ard 's " it 's-cool-to-be-stingy " price for snapping up broadcasting rights for the bundesliga last year and the widespread popularity of its sportschau program in germany . in an interview with newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , rummenigge admitted that the weekly sportschau served its purpose well and was good and serious in its reporting , but added that the ard had to ready to dig much deeper into its pockets if the bundesliga was to remain competitive and retain top-notch players . " with this -lrb- financial -rrb- game that we 're playing here , television is undoubtedly an important pillar , " rummenige said .
" it 's always nice to say that the fan wants to see his sportschau at 8.15 p.m.
but then somebody has to tell me how we 're going to finance this place here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , far right , the bayern boss added that boosting pay-tv was of utmost importance . " the bundesliga has to be interested in strengthening georg kofler 's -lrb- head of premiere -rrb- pay-tv , " rummenige said .
" premiere currently has around 3.25 million subscribers - that 's a positive trend but it 's still far removed from the seven million that bskyb has in england . " more business savvy needed however , the soccer researchers are clear that even if the television deal for the 2006/2007 season significantly increased revenues , the earnings of top german clubs would still be nowhere close to their european counterparts .
that 's because of skewed revenue distribution rules in germany among the soccer clubs which are not in direct proportion to a club 's performance on the field . " the bundesliga has to decide whether it wants to cling to the principle of solidarity or whether it wants to retains financial competition among the top german club on a european level by changing current distribution rules , " hovemann said .
" both are n't possible . " the study also advises the top clubs to roll back costs in the short term , particularly on personnel and player transfers .
much like before , most clubs are outfitted with too little personal capital , the study said , adding that many still boast intangible assets such as players with high market value and club brands . most clubs in germany are also moving away from traditional bank loans and looking at alternative ways to finance themselves , according to the study . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de borussia on the brink borussia dortmund , germany 's only publicly listed soccer club , said thursday it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse .

dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .

dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .
the assumption is that the chancellor hopes he will indeed be accorded parliament 's confidence .
but the constitution does n't forbid striving for clarification in a negative way .
it would n't be an abuse . when would it be an abuse ? one can speak of abuse if the chancellor and the majority of parliament try to establish a lack of confidence although they know for sure that they could continue to work together .
if they pronounce a lack of confidence aiming only to cause new elections , it would not be in the spirit of article 68 .
that would be manipulation . do you think there is a genuine lack of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag on top of the german parliament where ?
i ca n't see it .
criticism has come repeatedly from the parliamentary groups of the governing coalition , but that 's not enough .
the majority in the bundestag - which also requires several members from the government coalition - must say we can not work with this chancellor anymore .
i have n't seen this situation documented anywhere .
it must be verifiable .
i only see the usual conflicts .
if nothing happens , i ca n't see how they can use article 68 . assuming schröder is successful with his vote of no confidence , what will happen ? the chancellor must then ask the president to dissolve the bundestag .
he has three weeks to decide whether to dissolve it or not .
the president must first verify : is it a serious situation of lack of confidence ?
is there really a disruption and is the chancellor 's work hamstrung ?
the constitutional court has said that in resolving this legal question the president should take the chancellor 's assessment as the basis for his decision .
if the president goes along with the chancellor 's assessment , the question arises : does he order parliament to be dissolved ?
here the president has some discretionary scope .
even if he believes the preconditions of article 68 exist , he is n't obliged to dissolve parliament .
he can also say , " you must continue .
you -lrb- parliament -rrb- can elect a new chancellor with the -lrb- existing -rrb- majority . "

this would demonstrate that the chancellor no longer has majority backing within his own coalition government .

the humiliating defeat prompted the chancellor , by his own admission , to seek a new mandate for his government 's unpopular economic reforms .
although müntefering will still have to persuade parliamentarians to abstain , it looks almost certain that this will be the way the ruling social democrats will comply with the chancellor 's wish to have early elections on september 18 this year .
abstaining is the best solution an earlier suggestion according to which social democrat cabinet ministers would have had to abstain from voting has meanwhile been thrown overboard .
that solution would have come across as too much of a political farce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and schröder however , müntefering 's proposal could also appear ridiculous , if implemented , with the ruling coalition likely to push through a series of bills on thursday with a stable majority .
but senior spd member gernot erler defended the plan .
" if some 200 mps from the spd abstain from the vote , it should be easier for the federal president to see that early elections are supported by a strong majority , " said erler .
" this move would not be as tricky as forcing a couple of social democrat cabinet members to abstain .

the spd ’ s junior coalition partner , the ecologist greens , haven ’ t decided yet whether they 're willing to play along . " the idea of having early elections was n't ours to start with , " said claudia roth , the greens ' party co-leader .
" but since this is the wish of the chancellor , we 'll try and not stand in the way , also considering the strong wish for early elections among the population . "
according to roth , the greens mps may also abstain from voting .
but it was still too early to say what they will actually do .
" it 's been common practice in our party to first debate things thoroughly within our parliamentary group , " said roth .
an artificial confidence vote ?
uncertainties will remain on the bumpy road to early elections .
even if president köhler agrees to dissolve parliament , the social democrats may trip over the legal aspects of their political gamble .
müntefering ’ s proposal may raise the eyebrows of judges at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
some smaller parties , which are not represented in the federal parliament , have already announced they plan to take the matter before the karlsruhe court .
they do n't believe it 's legitimate to bring about an artificial vote of confidence and rig its outcome in advance , while at the same the ruling government adopts bills with a stable majority of its own .
but the spd 's erler does n't accept such arguments .
" we 're confident that with our planned procedure , the likelihood of early elections being accepted by the constitutional court in karlsruhe will increase , " said erler .
" certainly , the option of having a couple of cabinet ministers demonstrate they do n't support the chancellor anymore is n't very convincing , considering that they 've worked closely with schröder day in day out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.06.2005 germany gears up for cars made of plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler chrysler is powering ahead with biobased materials these days , cars are n't only made of chrome and steel - they can also contain coconut , sisal , flax , jute and other plant-based products .
are environmentally-friendly car parts the future ? you might expect to find corn , soybeans and hemp on the shelves of your local organic supermarket , but not usually in a list of car parts . increasingly , however , carmakers are using bio-based materials in entry-level economy cars and high-end luxury vehicles .
so what 's going on ? green cars the main uses for these natural ingredients are door cladding , seatback linings , seat bottoms , back cushions , head rests , under floor body panels and flexible tubing . " natural fibers derived from wood can be used for package shelves , for example " said wulf-peter schmidt from the ford plant in cologne .
" we also use less traditional materials such as kenaf , which is a member of the mallow family . " daimler chrysler 's mercedes models are equally green , with door paneling that contains a whole range of renewable materials , including flax , sisal and hemp , as well as coconut fibers and latex in the seat upholstery . " we recently introduced abaca fibers , which come from the philippines , " said press spokeswoman karin thiemann .
" it 's the first time that natural fabrics have been integrated into the exterior of a car - this time on the mould for the spare tire . " re-enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using these natural fibers makes sense in many cases .
those used in production are not used as raw materials but are combined with synthetic components such as polypropylenes to make what are known as natural fiber-enforced composites . " the fibers give the materials structure and serve primarily as reinforcement , " schmidt said . the natural fibers are subject to stringent safety controls , said hans schwager from bmw . " we check susceptibility to rupture , reaction to climate change and high temperature - the same tests we do on other materials , " he said . according to thiemann from daimler chrysler , the tests are even more rigorous than those run on synthetic materials . " but you have to take into account natural variations , " she said , pointing out that while the problem of wear and tear might not apply to glass fiber , it does play a role with natural fibers , as does water-resistance . sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic and ecological advantages are inextricably linked .
farming abaca , for example , helps create jobs and improve living conditions in the philippines , while the car manufacturers themselves benefit from weight reduction -lrb- and therefore better gas mileage -rrb- , and a cheaper production process . " these materials require 60 percent less energy during manufacturing , " thiemann said .
other plus points include biodegradability and the ability to recycle them . " waste lands on the compost heap , " she said . schwager from bmw pointed out that the composite fibers can be ground down and reused , while schmidt from ford is also keen to stress ecological expedience . " while renewable raw materials are being cultivated they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , which then , as it were , flows into the car , " he said .
" it 's a circular process . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leandro curia , a farm worker , distributes soybeans on a truck at a farm in salto , some 190 kilometers , -lrb- 120 miles -rrb- northeast of buenos aires , argentina , monday april 14 , 2003 .
farmers are among those benefiting the most from the peso devaluation last year as it had a direct impact on exporters in argentina , such as grain companies that export grains .
farmers have been contributing substantially to the national treasury 's chest through export taxes .
argentina , the world 's third largest soybean producer , expects a record crop for 2003 .
-lrb- ap photo / gustavo ercole -rrb- while environmental protection groups welcome these developments , they 're keeping a close eye on how the raw materials are farmed .
they oppose the felling of rain forests and also want to see car manufacturers uphold corporate responsibility and social standards by refusing to employ children , for example . but bio-based materials are n't a completely novel idea .
in 1941 , henry ford unveiled the first ever soybean car .
the idea might not have taken off then - but perhaps it will now . christof polzer / rafael heiling -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can ethical investors save german capitalism ?

" this will be another interesting test for our team . " the hosts will face a tough time against the mexicans who narrowly went out of the competition the day after germany lost 3-2 to brazil on saturday .
mexico were cruelly dumped out of the confed cup in a dramatic penalty shoot-out on sunday with argentina 's esteban cambiasso scoring the winning spot-kick after keeper german lux had saved ricardo osorio 's penalty . mexico held their own and even mastered the tournament favorites at times , adding weight to the growing sense that they could be a surprise package at the world cup in germany next summer .

the hosts are determined to get something out of their campaign , even if it is just third place . while the trophy is going to be in the hands of another captain on wednesday evening , germany skipper michael ballack and his team mates are determined to end their country 's participation in the confederations cup on a high . germany face mexico in leipzig on wednesday in the play-off for third place between the two group winners who were knocked out at the semi-final stage . " the public in leipzig can expect to see a tremendous game , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" this will be another interesting test for our team . " the hosts will face a tough time against the mexicans who narrowly went out of the competition the day after germany lost 3-2 to brazil on saturday .
mexico were cruelly dumped out of the confed cup in a dramatic penalty shoot-out on sunday with argentina 's esteban cambiasso scoring the winning spot-kick after keeper german lux had saved ricardo osorio 's penalty . mexico held their own and even mastered the tournament favorites at times , adding weight to the growing sense that they could be a surprise package at the world cup in germany next summer .
ricardo lavolpe 's men also defeated the world champions brazil in the group stage . germany gives respect but has victory in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann klinsmann is right to have words of respect for his opponents . " i have been hugely impressed by the performance of the mexican team in this tournament , " he said .
" they have beaten brazil and came very close to defeating argentina . " such respect was echoed by klinsmann 's right-hand man team manager oliver bierhoff . " mexico have been a revelation in the confederations cup , " he said .
" they are agile , quick and have great fighting spirit .
we are looking forward to playing against a tough opponent . " " it is vital that we finish the tournament on a high note , " said klinsmann . " naturally , we want to win and secure third place , " bierhoff added . the record books suggest that germany could be favorites with four wins , four draws and one defeat in the nine previous meetings between the two teams .
mexico 's only win dates back almost exactly 20 years to june 15 , 1985 , when they defeated germany 2-0 in mexico city . the germans , under berti vogts , won the last match , a knock-out stage game at the 1998 fifa world cup in france .
mexico lost that match in montpellier 2-1 , going down , ironically , to goals from klinsmann and bierhoff . mexico cautious but focused on winning mexico have come a long way since then and are determined not to roll over in the face of a partisan crowd and a home side with high ambitions .
after the disappointment of losing to argentina , jared borgetti turned his attention to the task ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's jared borgetti " now we want to beat germany and secure third place , " said the mexican striker , who added that mexico will once again have to be on top form to beat germany .
" this game is pretty special since we are playing against the host nation .
germany are a very tough nut to crack . " " we have a mountain to climb playing against the hosts in front of their home fans in a sell-out stadium , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . confed cup top attack versus top defense the third-placed game promises to be a cracking encounter in leipzig .
germany have the highest-scoring attack of the tournament while mexico have the strongest defense .
the german have scored eleven goals in their last four games while mexico have conceded only two . for the germans , they know they must go out on a high as a nation expects . " the players must give their all one more time , " klinsmann concluded .
" only then can they go on a well-earned holiday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 germany takes shaky route to early polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder handed in his request for a vote of confidence the head of germany 's ruling social democrats has called on his party 's members of parliament to abstain from the upcoming vote of confidence , that would ensure federal elections will be brought forward by a year . the head of germany 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- franz müntefering has asked his party 's members of parliament to abstain in this friday 's vote of confidence in parliament , the first step towards dissolving the parliament and paving the way for early federal elections .
this would demonstrate that the chancellor no longer has majority backing within his own coalition government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu celebrates victory in north rhine-westphalia chancellor gerhard schröder himself had announced his desire for early elections after a landslide victory for the opposition christian democrats in germany ’ s most populous federal state and long a spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , last month .
the humiliating defeat prompted the chancellor , by his own admission , to seek a new mandate for his government 's unpopular economic reforms .
although müntefering will still have to persuade parliamentarians to abstain , it looks almost certain that this will be the way the ruling social democrats will comply with the chancellor 's wish to have early elections on september 18 this year .
abstaining is the best solution an earlier suggestion according to which social democrat cabinet ministers would have had to abstain from voting has meanwhile been thrown overboard .
that solution would have come across as too much of a political farce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and schröder however , müntefering 's proposal could also appear ridiculous , if implemented , with the ruling coalition likely to push through a series of bills on thursday with a stable majority .
but senior spd member gernot erler defended the plan .
" if some 200 mps from the spd abstain from the vote , it should be easier for the federal president to see that early elections are supported by a strong majority , " said erler .
" this move would not be as tricky as forcing a couple of social democrat cabinet members to abstain .
so , i think this is the best solution to pave the way for dissolving parliament . "
will the greens play the game ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler german president horst köhler will have to give the go-ahead for dissolving parliament , should the chancellor lose the vote of confidence as planned .
the spd ’ s junior coalition partner , the ecologist greens , haven ’ t decided yet whether they 're willing to play along . " the idea of having early elections was n't ours to start with , " said claudia roth , the greens ' party co-leader .
" but since this is the wish of the chancellor , we 'll try and not stand in the way , also considering the strong wish for early elections among the population . "
according to roth , the greens mps may also abstain from voting .
but it was still too early to say what they will actually do .
" it 's been common practice in our party to first debate things thoroughly within our parliamentary group , " said roth .
an artificial confidence vote ?
uncertainties will remain on the bumpy road to early elections .
even if president köhler agrees to dissolve parliament , the social democrats may trip over the legal aspects of their political gamble .
müntefering ’ s proposal may raise the eyebrows of judges at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
some smaller parties , which are not represented in the federal parliament , have already announced they plan to take the matter before the karlsruhe court .
they do n't believe it 's legitimate to bring about an artificial vote of confidence and rig its outcome in advance , while at the same the ruling government adopts bills with a stable majority of its own .
but the spd 's erler does n't accept such arguments .
" we 're confident that with our planned procedure , the likelihood of early elections being accepted by the constitutional court in karlsruhe will increase , " said erler .
" certainly , the option of having a couple of cabinet ministers demonstrate they do n't support the chancellor anymore is n't very convincing , considering that they 've worked closely with schröder day in day out .

" i can not explain how this blunder came about , " pfahls , who is also a former head of the german domestic intelligence agency , told the court .
" i somehow got caught up in things . " bribes and gun-running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfahls is actually on trial over a separate affair .
he is accused of taking nearly two million euros in bribes for the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia in 1991 , and failing to declare the earnings . the presiding judge at the court in the southern city of augsburg , maximilian hofmeister , said pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession . " this will not be a short trial , " hofmeister said .
" but it does not have to be excessively long .
that depends on you , mr pfahls . " confession hofmeister said that the defendant had made statements to authorities ahead of the trial that were tantamount to a confession and said that those statements should now be repeated before the court . prosecutors believe pfahls accepted bribe money from schreiber in a swiss bank account during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain the armored vehicle contract . after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july last year . he initially opposed his extradition to germany but later relented , claiming the conditions at the sante prison in the french capital were " untenable and unacceptable . " bad timing for opposition the trial comes as germany heads into a national election in september , reviving old questions about campaign financing scandals during the kohl era . his defense lawyers said tuesday they would like to invite kohl and former foreign ministers klaus kinkel and hans-dietrich genscher to testify about the sale of the armored vehicles to saudi arabia . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fugitive pfahls comes home - to prison former junior cabinet minister holger pfahls , one of germany ’ s most wanted men , was returned to the country thursday after being captured in france last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 france wins nuclear fusion plant großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu research commissioner janez potocnik : " a major step forward " france will host the experimental iter nuclear fusion reactor , a multi-billion-euro project designed to emulate the sun 's power , the six partners in the project agreed in moscow on tuesday , after japan withdrew its bid . the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- will be a little like trying to build a star on earth .
the technology is daunting , but if it works , scientists say the world will benefit from a source of energy that will be cheap , clean , safe and almost infinite .
for years , the six iter partners - the eu , the united states , russia , japan , south korea and china - had wrangled over which country would get to host the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 12 billion -rrb- project .
they finally reached an agreement after japan withdrew its bid , settling on moscow and beijing 's preferred site , cadarache , france . " today we are making history in terms of international scientific cooperation , " said janez potocnik , the eu 's science and research commissioner , at a ceremony in moscow .
" after long and difficult negotiations , the six parties ... have decided that iter should be located at the site proposed by the european union - cadarache in southern france . " bildunterschrift : under tuesday 's agreement , 50 percent of the cost of the project will be paid by the eu , with the rest shared out between the five other partners . japan 's science minister nariaki nakyama expressed satisfaction at the outcome of negotiations . " we managed to secure a status that amounts to being a secondary host of the project ...
this and other conditions should allow us to preserve our national interests completely , " nakayama said in a statement . recreating the power of the sun instead of splitting the atom - the principle behind current nuclear plants - iter seeks to harness nuclear fusion : the power of the sun and the stars . iter was conceived at an international summit in 1985 as a test bench to see whether fusion can be taken out of the lab and help meet the world 's energy needs from the middle of the 21st century . the science behind the project presents an immense technological challenge , since fusing together atomic nuclei will require a gas field heated to 100 million degrees inside an intense magnetic field . but the result , scientists hope , will be a plentiful energy supply that will compensate for diminishing reserves of oil , coal and natural gas .
one of the hydrogen isotopes needed to fuel the process is found in water while the other can be man-made . bildunterschrift : iter generic site view environmentalists angered proponents of the project have said it will create hundreds of jobs in southern france and boost the region 's economy .
but french environmental groups slammed the project tuesday , saying it was " dangerous , " " costly , " and " not a job generator . " " we are against the project because it 's very dangerous and will not create jobs in the region , " the head of the mediane environmental group , jean marcon , said . an umbrella association including mediane and other groups , sortir du nucleaire -lrb- get out of nuclear energy -rrb- , also claimed that iter was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium hydrogen isotopes used in the fusion process . the environmentalists highlighted a warning from masatoshi koshiba , a japanese scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 2002 , that iter did not meet " a certain number of conditions , namely safety and economic costs " for it to be considered the dream energy of the future . the environmental group greenpeace said that if iter is to yield any results at all , it will not be until the second half of this century . " at a time when it is universally recognised that we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 , greenpeace considers it ridiculous to use resources and billions of euros on this project , " it said . construction to take at least a decade the construction program is expected to take around 10 years at a cost of 4.6 billion euros , though some scientists have said it could take three times as long .
once the reactor is ready , experiments would begin and continue for some 20 years , testing iter for technological feasibility , safety , health and waste management . bildunterschrift : from left : iaea 's werner burkart , china 's guanhua xu , eu 's janez potochnik , russia 's alexander rumyantsev , japan 's nariaki nakayama , korea 's seok-sik choi , american raymond orbach after signing an agreement at moscow 's president hotel , tuesday , june 28 , 2005 .
a six-party consortium chose france as the site for an experimental nuclear fusion reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , opening the way for development of a potential source of clean , inexhaustible energy . if this experimental machine is successful , a demo fusion power plant would be built and - if all goes well - the first commercial fusion plant would be created mid-century . french president jacques chirac thanked the member countries of the eu , as well as russia and china who lent their support to the french bid . " it is a big success for france , for europe and for all the partners of iter , " chirac said . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?

poles responded with humor , but say that attitudes have n't changed much towards the new eastern eu members . the french “ non ” campaign was specific : a yes vote means the “ polish plumber ” will take french jobs .
but these days , annoyed with the negative image of eastern europeans portrayed by richer western eu countries , poles have come up with a creative way to fight back .
hence the hunky polish plumber , beckoning visitors to poland .
“ i am remaining in poland , ” reads the ad featuring a blond , well-built man , created by the polish tourist board .
“ come visit . ”
“ we didn ’ t agree with the negative image of poles used during the campaign , ” said katarzyna gubois of the polish tourist board in paris .
“ we wanted to show something else of poland and tell people they are welcome to visit our country . ”
schizophrenic view poles and other new eastern members of the european union have often been seen as second class citizens of europe , say poles .
and it is a view that richer , more established countries such as france and germany sometimes use to their advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating joining the eu club last may “ it is quite schizophrenic how they look at us , ” said adam krzeminksi , a journalist in warsaw who founded the german-polish magazine , dialogue .
“ on one hand , they treat us as if we don ’ t exist .
on the other hand , we are seen as a threat , taking their land , autos , jobs . ” sabine woelker , an expert on polish-german relations for the german council on foreign relations in berlin says that negative stereotypes of poland and its eastern neighbors still exist but are changing slowly . “ poles are still seen as coming into germany illegally , working as construction workers or cleaners , ” she said .
“ the idea still exists that poles are lazy , that one has to watch their valuables around them , and people still joke about how risky it is to take one ’ s car to poland .
but this is changing as german employers see that poles are very flexible , work well and are worth their wages . ” those stereotypes frustrate ordinary poles who have lived in western europe , particularly younger , more educated ones . “ i got tired of being looked down on , being viewed with suspicion ” said one pole , a government auditor from warsaw who spent time in a german government ministry during an exchange program .
“ we are not all housecleaners or plumbers or car thieves . ” defying stereotypes these days , more than a year after joining the club , poles – who are usually the most negatively stereotyped by western countries - are fighting clichés with the ad campaign and defying them with success . for example , the polish economy is one of the fastest growing ones in the eu .
it grew by more than five percent last year .
the country , which still receives millions of euros in subsidies from the eu , became a net development aid donor to poorer nations in asia and africa for the first time this year , according to the united nations development program .
and a massive labor migration predicted by western eu politicians has not materialized – only a few hundred thousand workers have migrated across borders since last may , mostly for seasonal work , poland ’ s labor department reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer embraces his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz : relations not always this warm still , fears persist over western companies moving their manufacturing plants to the east where labor costs are as little as a quarter of western ones .
this is going to the major factor in how western countries view the east in the future , says one labor ministry official in warsaw . “ the french and german politicians played on people ’ s fears of losing their jobs , ” the official said .
“ and if the economic situation of france and germany continue to stagnate , then politicians will continue to do so , no matter what the reality is . ” seen as politically unimportant , then and now poland , which has ceased to exist as a nation a number of times in its history , and has always been sandwiched between two larger powers , germany and russia , is just not so important for western eu members , say political scientists . “ poland has never been an important partner for germany , ” said woelker .
“ there has been too many conflicts about history and it is seen as very nationalist , conservative and focused on its own sovereignty . ” she says it is also seen as a thorn in the attempt to improve germany ’ s relations with russia , something viewed with suspicion in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : important alliesagainst eu sceptics at the same time , while france told poland to ‘ shut up ’ during its initial opposition to particular provisions in the original draft of the eu constitution and both france and germany derided poland ’ s pro-us stance regarding the iraq war , german president horst köhler made a point of visiting poland first , before france , when he took office last year .

“ and it has shown that it can be a good ally , particularly regarding the european union . ” poles picked on many poles grumble that it is always poland singled out for negative stereotyping .
why does no one mention the spanish construction worker or irish barman abroad , they wonder . political scientists says that is because that other countries such as spain or ireland are more established and that most new eu members are much smaller and less visible , have fewer aspirations to be a regional player and export fewer people abroad . “ or maybe it is because polish plumbers are more attractive , ” gubois joked . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-polish year offers antidote to past the launch of german-polish year was marked this week with a ceremony held on the bridge spanning the river oder between frankfurt and slubice .

poles responded with humor , but say that attitudes have n't changed much towards the new eastern eu members . the french “ non ” campaign was specific : a yes vote means the “ polish plumber ” will take french jobs .
but these days , annoyed with the negative image of eastern europeans portrayed by richer western eu countries , poles have come up with a creative way to fight back .
hence the hunky polish plumber , beckoning visitors to poland .
“ i am remaining in poland , ” reads the ad featuring a blond , well-built man , created by the polish tourist board .
“ come visit . ”
“ we didn ’ t agree with the negative image of poles used during the campaign , ” said katarzyna gubois of the polish tourist board in paris .
“ we wanted to show something else of poland and tell people they are welcome to visit our country . ”
schizophrenic view poles and other new eastern members of the european union have often been seen as second class citizens of europe , say poles .

“ on one hand , they treat us as if we don ’ t exist .
on the other hand , we are seen as a threat , taking their land , autos , jobs . ” sabine woelker , an expert on polish-german relations for the german council on foreign relations in berlin says that negative stereotypes of poland and its eastern neighbors still exist but are changing slowly . “ poles are still seen as coming into germany illegally , working as construction workers or cleaners , ” she said .
“ the idea still exists that poles are lazy , that one has to watch their valuables around them , and people still joke about how risky it is to take one ’ s car to poland .
but this is changing as german employers see that poles are very flexible , work well and are worth their wages . ” those stereotypes frustrate ordinary poles who have lived in western europe , particularly younger , more educated ones . “ i got tired of being looked down on , being viewed with suspicion ” said one pole , a government auditor from warsaw who spent time in a german government ministry during an exchange program .
“ we are not all housecleaners or plumbers or car thieves . ” defying stereotypes these days , more than a year after joining the club , poles – who are usually the most negatively stereotyped by western countries - are fighting clichés with the ad campaign and defying them with success . for example , the polish economy is one of the fastest growing ones in the eu .

the country , which still receives millions of euros in subsidies from the eu , became a net development aid donor to poorer nations in asia and africa for the first time this year , according to the united nations development program .

this is going to the major factor in how western countries view the east in the future , says one labor ministry official in warsaw . “ the french and german politicians played on people ’ s fears of losing their jobs , ” the official said .

poles responded with humor , but say that attitudes have n't changed much towards the new eastern eu members . the french “ non ” campaign was specific : a yes vote means the “ polish plumber ” will take french jobs .
but these days , annoyed with the negative image of eastern europeans portrayed by richer western eu countries , poles have come up with a creative way to fight back .
hence the hunky polish plumber , beckoning visitors to poland .
“ i am remaining in poland , ” reads the ad featuring a blond , well-built man , created by the polish tourist board .
“ come visit . ”
“ we didn ’ t agree with the negative image of poles used during the campaign , ” said katarzyna gubois of the polish tourist board in paris .
“ we wanted to show something else of poland and tell people they are welcome to visit our country . ”
schizophrenic view poles and other new eastern members of the european union have often been seen as second class citizens of europe , say poles .
and it is a view that richer , more established countries such as france and germany sometimes use to their advantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating joining the eu club last may “ it is quite schizophrenic how they look at us , ” said adam krzeminksi , a journalist in warsaw who founded the german-polish magazine , dialogue .
“ on one hand , they treat us as if we don ’ t exist .
on the other hand , we are seen as a threat , taking their land , autos , jobs . ” sabine woelker , an expert on polish-german relations for the german council on foreign relations in berlin says that negative stereotypes of poland and its eastern neighbors still exist but are changing slowly . “ poles are still seen as coming into germany illegally , working as construction workers or cleaners , ” she said .
“ the idea still exists that poles are lazy , that one has to watch their valuables around them , and people still joke about how risky it is to take one ’ s car to poland .
but this is changing as german employers see that poles are very flexible , work well and are worth their wages . ” those stereotypes frustrate ordinary poles who have lived in western europe , particularly younger , more educated ones . “ i got tired of being looked down on , being viewed with suspicion ” said one pole , a government auditor from warsaw who spent time in a german government ministry during an exchange program .
“ we are not all housecleaners or plumbers or car thieves . ” defying stereotypes these days , more than a year after joining the club , poles – who are usually the most negatively stereotyped by western countries - are fighting clichés with the ad campaign and defying them with success . for example , the polish economy is one of the fastest growing ones in the eu .
it grew by more than five percent last year .
the country , which still receives millions of euros in subsidies from the eu , became a net development aid donor to poorer nations in asia and africa for the first time this year , according to the united nations development program .
and a massive labor migration predicted by western eu politicians has not materialized – only a few hundred thousand workers have migrated across borders since last may , mostly for seasonal work , poland ’ s labor department reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer embraces his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz : relations not always this warm still , fears persist over western companies moving their manufacturing plants to the east where labor costs are as little as a quarter of western ones .
this is going to the major factor in how western countries view the east in the future , says one labor ministry official in warsaw . “ the french and german politicians played on people ’ s fears of losing their jobs , ” the official said .
“ and if the economic situation of france and germany continue to stagnate , then politicians will continue to do so , no matter what the reality is . ” seen as politically unimportant , then and now poland , which has ceased to exist as a nation a number of times in its history , and has always been sandwiched between two larger powers , germany and russia , is just not so important for western eu members , say political scientists . “ poland has never been an important partner for germany , ” said woelker .
“ there has been too many conflicts about history and it is seen as very nationalist , conservative and focused on its own sovereignty . ” she says it is also seen as a thorn in the attempt to improve germany ’ s relations with russia , something viewed with suspicion in poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : important alliesagainst eu sceptics at the same time , while france told poland to ‘ shut up ’ during its initial opposition to particular provisions in the original draft of the eu constitution and both france and germany derided poland ’ s pro-us stance regarding the iraq war , german president horst köhler made a point of visiting poland first , before france , when he took office last year .
that sent a message that germany views poland as an important neighbor . “ poland ’ s word does have weight even if some don ’ t want to see that , ” woelker added .
“ and it has shown that it can be a good ally , particularly regarding the european union . ” poles picked on many poles grumble that it is always poland singled out for negative stereotyping .
why does no one mention the spanish construction worker or irish barman abroad , they wonder . political scientists says that is because that other countries such as spain or ireland are more established and that most new eu members are much smaller and less visible , have fewer aspirations to be a regional player and export fewer people abroad . “ or maybe it is because polish plumbers are more attractive , ” gubois joked . jabeen bhatti , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-polish year offers antidote to past the launch of german-polish year was marked this week with a ceremony held on the bridge spanning the river oder between frankfurt and slubice .

germany has questioned a british proposal that the g8 nations double their development aid .
chancellor schröder 's africa advisor said that a sudden increase in foreign aid to african countries would be counterproductive . leaders at the upcoming g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland will also be discussing how to help africa defeat poverty and embark on a journey of rapid growth .
britain is expected to put forward a plan envisaging the doubling of development aid to africa to $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.6 billion euros -rrb- in the near future .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's advisor on africa policy , uschi eid , said the plan does not come at the right time .
" without strong institutions and professional capacities , a doubling of aid is not very useful , " eid said .
" of course , we want to double development assistance to africa .
but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work and to make sure the necessary infrastructure is put in place . "
eid was speaking after a meeting with wiseman nkuhlu , the executive director of africa 's homegrown nepad initiative , in berlin on monday .
fragile reforms in africa founded in 2001 , nepad aims to revitalize the continent 's ailing economy by attracting private investors with progress in conflict resolution and improved transparency .
the organization received full backing from the group of eight in 2002 and pledges from rich countries to support the initiative with billions of dollars in financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack of clean water is a major problem in developing countries eid said that enormous progress had been made in a number of countries under the nepad initiative .
germany 's plan to double aid to africa in the next 10 years , she said , was better suited to achieve the ambitious goals in health , education and poverty reduction .
but nkuhlu disagreed .
" i 'm convinced that there 's a large number of african countries that can absorb increased levels of development assistance , " nkuhlu said .
he said it was critical that industrialized nations strongly aid those countries that are making progress .
" but the reforms in a number of countries in africa are still very fragile because the majority of african countries are too poor to really deliver on promises to their people , " he added .
better access to markets nkuhlu said he hoped that the issue of increased assistance would be on the agenda in gleneagles regardless of the resistance of some industrialized countries .
he said it was now critically important that the g8 pledged further support for the reform process in africa .
" the question of access to markets is also critical , " nkuhlu said .
" africa needs to increase production .
that 's a major issue in terms of progress . "
germany has supported nepad with 2.5 billion euros over the past three years .
it is especially active in the field of conflict resolution , promoting good governance , water management and private sector investment .
the german government , however , wants to see greater progress in the field of political reforms and democracy .
eid praised nepad 's peer review mechanism under which african countries assess each other 's performance in these areas .
she stressed , though , that recent delays in the publication of the first national reports regarding ghana and rwanda must be made up for quickly . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin have brushed back charges from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

germany has questioned a british proposal that the g8 nations double their development aid .
chancellor schröder 's africa advisor said that a sudden increase in foreign aid to african countries would be counterproductive . leaders at the upcoming g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland will also be discussing how to help africa defeat poverty and embark on a journey of rapid growth .
britain is expected to put forward a plan envisaging the doubling of development aid to africa to $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.6 billion euros -rrb- in the near future .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's advisor on africa policy , uschi eid , said the plan does not come at the right time .
" without strong institutions and professional capacities , a doubling of aid is not very useful , " eid said .
" of course , we want to double development assistance to africa .
but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work and to make sure the necessary infrastructure is put in place . "
eid was speaking after a meeting with wiseman nkuhlu , the executive director of africa 's homegrown nepad initiative , in berlin on monday .
fragile reforms in africa founded in 2001 , nepad aims to revitalize the continent 's ailing economy by attracting private investors with progress in conflict resolution and improved transparency .
the organization received full backing from the group of eight in 2002 and pledges from rich countries to support the initiative with billions of dollars in financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack of clean water is a major problem in developing countries eid said that enormous progress had been made in a number of countries under the nepad initiative .
germany 's plan to double aid to africa in the next 10 years , she said , was better suited to achieve the ambitious goals in health , education and poverty reduction .
but nkuhlu disagreed .
" i 'm convinced that there 's a large number of african countries that can absorb increased levels of development assistance , " nkuhlu said .
he said it was critical that industrialized nations strongly aid those countries that are making progress .
" but the reforms in a number of countries in africa are still very fragile because the majority of african countries are too poor to really deliver on promises to their people , " he added .
better access to markets nkuhlu said he hoped that the issue of increased assistance would be on the agenda in gleneagles regardless of the resistance of some industrialized countries .
he said it was now critically important that the g8 pledged further support for the reform process in africa .
" the question of access to markets is also critical , " nkuhlu said .
" africa needs to increase production .
that 's a major issue in terms of progress . "
germany has supported nepad with 2.5 billion euros over the past three years .
it is especially active in the field of conflict resolution , promoting good governance , water management and private sector investment .
the german government , however , wants to see greater progress in the field of political reforms and democracy .
eid praised nepad 's peer review mechanism under which african countries assess each other 's performance in these areas .
she stressed , though , that recent delays in the publication of the first national reports regarding ghana and rwanda must be made up for quickly . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin have brushed back charges from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 road to early polls fraught with obstacles 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will actually be hoping for defeat on friday hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .
dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not .

dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .
the assumption is that the chancellor hopes he will indeed be accorded parliament 's confidence .
but the constitution does n't forbid striving for clarification in a negative way .
it would n't be an abuse . when would it be an abuse ? one can speak of abuse if the chancellor and the majority of parliament try to establish a lack of confidence although they know for sure that they could continue to work together .
if they pronounce a lack of confidence aiming only to cause new elections , it would not be in the spirit of article 68 .
that would be manipulation . do you think there is a genuine lack of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag on top of the german parliament where ?
i ca n't see it .
criticism has come repeatedly from the parliamentary groups of the governing coalition , but that 's not enough .
the majority in the bundestag - which also requires several members from the government coalition - must say we can not work with this chancellor anymore .
i have n't seen this situation documented anywhere .
it must be verifiable .
i only see the usual conflicts .
if nothing happens , i ca n't see how they can use article 68 . assuming schröder is successful with his vote of no confidence , what will happen ? the chancellor must then ask the president to dissolve the bundestag .
he has three weeks to decide whether to dissolve it or not .
the president must first verify : is it a serious situation of lack of confidence ?
is there really a disruption and is the chancellor 's work hamstrung ?
the constitutional court has said that in resolving this legal question the president should take the chancellor 's assessment as the basis for his decision .
if the president goes along with the chancellor 's assessment , the question arises : does he order parliament to be dissolved ?
here the president has some discretionary scope .
even if he believes the preconditions of article 68 exist , he is n't obliged to dissolve parliament .
he can also say , " you must continue .
you -lrb- parliament -rrb- can elect a new chancellor with the -lrb- existing -rrb- majority . "

the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .

dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .
the assumption is that the chancellor hopes he will indeed be accorded parliament 's confidence .
but the constitution does n't forbid striving for clarification in a negative way .
it would n't be an abuse . when would it be an abuse ? one can speak of abuse if the chancellor and the majority of parliament try to establish a lack of confidence although they know for sure that they could continue to work together .
if they pronounce a lack of confidence aiming only to cause new elections , it would not be in the spirit of article 68 .
that would be manipulation . do you think there is a genuine lack of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag on top of the german parliament where ?
i ca n't see it .
criticism has come repeatedly from the parliamentary groups of the governing coalition , but that 's not enough .
the majority in the bundestag - which also requires several members from the government coalition - must say we can not work with this chancellor anymore .
i have n't seen this situation documented anywhere .
it must be verifiable .
i only see the usual conflicts .
if nothing happens , i ca n't see how they can use article 68 . assuming schröder is successful with his vote of no confidence , what will happen ? the chancellor must then ask the president to dissolve the bundestag .
he has three weeks to decide whether to dissolve it or not .
the president must first verify : is it a serious situation of lack of confidence ?
is there really a disruption and is the chancellor 's work hamstrung ?
the constitutional court has said that in resolving this legal question the president should take the chancellor 's assessment as the basis for his decision .
if the president goes along with the chancellor 's assessment , the question arises : does he order parliament to be dissolved ?
here the president has some discretionary scope .
even if he believes the preconditions of article 68 exist , he is n't obliged to dissolve parliament .
he can also say , " you must continue .
you -lrb- parliament -rrb- can elect a new chancellor with the -lrb- existing -rrb- majority . "

dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .

in its judgment , the court would certainly refer to its 1983 decision .
-lrb- editor 's note : shortly after his election as chancellor by parliament , helmut kohl " used " the vote of confidence in january 1983 to have a new bundestag elected . -rrb-
it was a similar situation .
then the court drafted guidelines to article 68 and made clear that - even if everyone wants them - article 68 is not a suitable route to new elections .
the disruption between the parliamentary majority and the chancellor is necessary .
if it ca n't be verified - and the result of the vote is n't proof since it can be faked - the constitutional court will determine that -lrb- the vote of no confidence -rrb- was unconstitutional .
how can the rift be verified ? in 1983 , the court stuck to things that had been said and written in public .
besides that the president held talks with the party and parliamentary group leaders .
based on the publicized material and these talks , the court gained the impression that , yes , it ca n't continue . how does the situation today differ from the situation in 1983 ? then , the situation had already been manipulated and , i think , should not have been allowed to reach dissolution of parliament .
the constitutional court had set strict guidelines but did n't adhere to them .
then we at least had documented statements from the fdp -lrb- the governing coalition partner -rrb- that said : " we only want to cooperate with the chancellor , who attained office through a vote of no confidence , for a limited amount of time . "
the court took that seriously and classified it as a crisis situation .
but today the situation is not at all comparable . what is your view of some ministers ' intentions to possibly abstain in the july 1 vote of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet during a retreat in 2003 if the vote of no confidence comes through only because the ministers abstain , the supposition of manipulation stands to reason .
of all people the most loyal of the loyal fail , abstain from voting and thus a majority against the chancellor is achieved .
that 's not a disruption .
i can only warn against such a step because it would document that the whole thing was a fake . should n't schröder just resign ? i understand why schröder has n't chosen the resignation route .
schröder is saying that he 'd like to continue but he 's unsure as to whether the voters support him .
but he can not ask the voters whether they still want him by resigning .
for , resignation does n't lead directly to new elections .
only if the bundestag repeatedly fails to elect a new chancellor does the dissolution of parliament become an option .
but it 's very vague and a complicated and protracted route .
if he were to resign , it would mean he gave up . what do you think would be the best way to bring about fresh elections ? one could initiate the bundestag 's right to self-dissolution .
that 's an entirely unsuspicious instrument .
it envisages that the bundestag decides on its dissolution with a qualified majority .
but strangely there are reservations about employing it .
i do n't know who 's afraid of what . the former president of the constitutional court , ernst benda , has criticized the attempt to bring on new elections using the vote of confidence .
he says it gives the impression that politicians see the constitution only as a " cumbersome obstacle . "
what do you think ? i have nothing to add .
it does n't only give that impression ; the impression has been made .
all parties are now preparing their election campaigns .
the opposition 's reaction to the chancellor 's announcement to bring about new elections was hectic .
instantly , they designated a candidate for chancellor .

-lrb- editor 's note : shortly after his election as chancellor by parliament , helmut kohl " used " the vote of confidence in january 1983 to have a new bundestag elected . -rrb-
it was a similar situation .
then the court drafted guidelines to article 68 and made clear that - even if everyone wants them - article 68 is not a suitable route to new elections .
the disruption between the parliamentary majority and the chancellor is necessary .
if it ca n't be verified - and the result of the vote is n't proof since it can be faked - the constitutional court will determine that -lrb- the vote of no confidence -rrb- was unconstitutional .
how can the rift be verified ? in 1983 , the court stuck to things that had been said and written in public .
besides that the president held talks with the party and parliamentary group leaders .
based on the publicized material and these talks , the court gained the impression that , yes , it ca n't continue . how does the situation today differ from the situation in 1983 ? then , the situation had already been manipulated and , i think , should not have been allowed to reach dissolution of parliament .
the constitutional court had set strict guidelines but did n't adhere to them .
then we at least had documented statements from the fdp -lrb- the governing coalition partner -rrb- that said : " we only want to cooperate with the chancellor , who attained office through a vote of no confidence , for a limited amount of time . "
the court took that seriously and classified it as a crisis situation .

of all people the most loyal of the loyal fail , abstain from voting and thus a majority against the chancellor is achieved .
that 's not a disruption .
i can only warn against such a step because it would document that the whole thing was a fake . should n't schröder just resign ? i understand why schröder has n't chosen the resignation route .
schröder is saying that he 'd like to continue but he 's unsure as to whether the voters support him .
but he can not ask the voters whether they still want him by resigning .
for , resignation does n't lead directly to new elections .
only if the bundestag repeatedly fails to elect a new chancellor does the dissolution of parliament become an option .
but it 's very vague and a complicated and protracted route .
if he were to resign , it would mean he gave up . what do you think would be the best way to bring about fresh elections ? one could initiate the bundestag 's right to self-dissolution .
that 's an entirely unsuspicious instrument .
it envisages that the bundestag decides on its dissolution with a qualified majority .
but strangely there are reservations about employing it .
i do n't know who 's afraid of what . the former president of the constitutional court , ernst benda , has criticized the attempt to bring on new elections using the vote of confidence .

it does n't only give that impression ; the impression has been made .
all parties are now preparing their election campaigns .
the opposition 's reaction to the chancellor 's announcement to bring about new elections was hectic .

are environmentally-friendly car parts the future ? you might expect to find corn , soybeans and hemp on the shelves of your local organic supermarket , but not usually in a list of car parts . increasingly , however , carmakers are using bio-based materials in entry-level economy cars and high-end luxury vehicles .
so what 's going on ? green cars the main uses for these natural ingredients are door cladding , seatback linings , seat bottoms , back cushions , head rests , under floor body panels and flexible tubing . " natural fibers derived from wood can be used for package shelves , for example " said wulf-peter schmidt from the ford plant in cologne .
" we also use less traditional materials such as kenaf , which is a member of the mallow family . " daimler chrysler 's mercedes models are equally green , with door paneling that contains a whole range of renewable materials , including flax , sisal and hemp , as well as coconut fibers and latex in the seat upholstery . " we recently introduced abaca fibers , which come from the philippines , " said press spokeswoman karin thiemann .
" it 's the first time that natural fabrics have been integrated into the exterior of a car - this time on the mould for the spare tire . " re-enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using these natural fibers makes sense in many cases .
those used in production are not used as raw materials but are combined with synthetic components such as polypropylenes to make what are known as natural fiber-enforced composites . " the fibers give the materials structure and serve primarily as reinforcement , " schmidt said . the natural fibers are subject to stringent safety controls , said hans schwager from bmw . " we check susceptibility to rupture , reaction to climate change and high temperature - the same tests we do on other materials , " he said . according to thiemann from daimler chrysler , the tests are even more rigorous than those run on synthetic materials . " but you have to take into account natural variations , " she said , pointing out that while the problem of wear and tear might not apply to glass fiber , it does play a role with natural fibers , as does water-resistance . sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic and ecological advantages are inextricably linked .
farming abaca , for example , helps create jobs and improve living conditions in the philippines , while the car manufacturers themselves benefit from weight reduction -lrb- and therefore better gas mileage -rrb- , and a cheaper production process . " these materials require 60 percent less energy during manufacturing , " thiemann said .
other plus points include biodegradability and the ability to recycle them . " waste lands on the compost heap , " she said . schwager from bmw pointed out that the composite fibers can be ground down and reused , while schmidt from ford is also keen to stress ecological expedience .

are environmentally-friendly car parts the future ? you might expect to find corn , soybeans and hemp on the shelves of your local organic supermarket , but not usually in a list of car parts . increasingly , however , carmakers are using bio-based materials in entry-level economy cars and high-end luxury vehicles .
so what 's going on ? green cars the main uses for these natural ingredients are door cladding , seatback linings , seat bottoms , back cushions , head rests , under floor body panels and flexible tubing . " natural fibers derived from wood can be used for package shelves , for example " said wulf-peter schmidt from the ford plant in cologne .
" we also use less traditional materials such as kenaf , which is a member of the mallow family . " daimler chrysler 's mercedes models are equally green , with door paneling that contains a whole range of renewable materials , including flax , sisal and hemp , as well as coconut fibers and latex in the seat upholstery . " we recently introduced abaca fibers , which come from the philippines , " said press spokeswoman karin thiemann .
" it 's the first time that natural fabrics have been integrated into the exterior of a car - this time on the mould for the spare tire . " re-enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using these natural fibers makes sense in many cases .
those used in production are not used as raw materials but are combined with synthetic components such as polypropylenes to make what are known as natural fiber-enforced composites . " the fibers give the materials structure and serve primarily as reinforcement , " schmidt said . the natural fibers are subject to stringent safety controls , said hans schwager from bmw . " we check susceptibility to rupture , reaction to climate change and high temperature - the same tests we do on other materials , " he said . according to thiemann from daimler chrysler , the tests are even more rigorous than those run on synthetic materials . " but you have to take into account natural variations , " she said , pointing out that while the problem of wear and tear might not apply to glass fiber , it does play a role with natural fibers , as does water-resistance . sustainability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic and ecological advantages are inextricably linked .
farming abaca , for example , helps create jobs and improve living conditions in the philippines , while the car manufacturers themselves benefit from weight reduction -lrb- and therefore better gas mileage -rrb- , and a cheaper production process . " these materials require 60 percent less energy during manufacturing , " thiemann said .
other plus points include biodegradability and the ability to recycle them . " waste lands on the compost heap , " she said . schwager from bmw pointed out that the composite fibers can be ground down and reused , while schmidt from ford is also keen to stress ecological expedience . " while renewable raw materials are being cultivated they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere , which then , as it were , flows into the car , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2005 the demise of germany 's pedestrian zones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the ultimate shopping experience hamburg has its port , frankfurt its banks and cologne its cathedral .
but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .
maybe they had their first kiss on a warm summer evening at the fountain along the quiet cobblestone streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people often beg in pedestrian zones but now , in economically difficult times , their atmosphere has suffered and these car-free areas appear dreary and shabby .
junk and penny pincher shops are driving out long-established stores , with homeless people meeting in front of the town hall for their first beer at ten in the morning .
creating a modern city the pedestrian zone was born in the central german city of kassel .
over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .
the attitude of the 1950s kassel 's pedestrian zone , the treppenstrasse , opened in 1953 and quickly became a national attraction .
in the same year , stuttgart and kiel began building car-free shopping areas and over the next few years , most other german cities followed suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most pedestrian zones are packed with shoppers on the weekend often , existing streets were simply blocked for cars and made into pedestrian zones .
but in kassel , this area was designed solely for this purpose , with a combination of simple architecture , fountains and green spaces , reminiscent of the postwar german 's idea of a mediterranean piazza .
" it is n't bombastic , but rather has a lightness , charm and liveliness to it , like the attitude to life in the 1950s , " said christian kopetzki , a professor of urban planning at the university of kassel .
" it was so to speak a reflex to overcome the horrors before it .
you find that in that architecture . "
from a pretty girl to an aging matron today , the concrete is slowly crumbling .
the architecture appears somewhat stale and the store areas are too small for the shopping adventure these days , said kassel optician hans uwe hess .
part of the city 's famous treppenstrasse now houses junk shops , where everything only costs one euro , and dim bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the place to go " it was once a pretty young girl and today , it 's more of a matron , who 's no longer as neat as she should be , " hess said .
" it 's not as interesting to look at anymore . "
kassel is not alone in this development .
many pedestrian zones in major and smaller cities are no longer living up to their colorful history .
perhaps the problem lies in the country 's failing economy .
germany can simply no longer keep its promise of mass consumption , which these areas used to represent . kerstin hilt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

the report found that the number of corporate bankruptcies shrank in the first half of this year by 6.2 percent to 18,700 .
for the first time , western germany too recorded fewer financial collapses among companies .
experts are predicting corporate insolvencies to drop to 38,000 for the entire year , a decrease of 3.2 percent .
however , creditreform 's executive head , helmut rödl said they were expecting up to 580,000 jobs to be threatened through bankruptcies , adding there could be no talk of an " all-clear on the insolvency front . "
referring to the record explosion of personal bankruptcies of 29,200 across germany in the first half of the year , rödl said joblessness , partner separations and illness were the main culprits for forcing people into debt .
" the general business knowledge among large swathes of the population leaves much to be desired , " rödl added .
" several slip into bankruptcy without even realizing it . " dw-world.de german business looks to life after schröder executives , once charmed by chancellor schröder , are hungry for political and economic change with the promise of early polls .
but the opposition conservatives remain cagey about their plans for the sputtering economy .

but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .

over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .
the attitude of the 1950s kassel 's pedestrian zone , the treppenstrasse , opened in 1953 and quickly became a national attraction .

" it is n't bombastic , but rather has a lightness , charm and liveliness to it , like the attitude to life in the 1950s , " said christian kopetzki , a professor of urban planning at the university of kassel .
" it was so to speak a reflex to overcome the horrors before it .

but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .
maybe they had their first kiss on a warm summer evening at the fountain along the quiet cobblestone streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people often beg in pedestrian zones but now , in economically difficult times , their atmosphere has suffered and these car-free areas appear dreary and shabby .
junk and penny pincher shops are driving out long-established stores , with homeless people meeting in front of the town hall for their first beer at ten in the morning .
creating a modern city the pedestrian zone was born in the central german city of kassel .
over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .

but when it comes to making millions from tv rights , the top soccer league is languishing when compared to its european counterparts . the study by global auditor ernst & young , which surveyed managers of both the clubs in the bundesliga as well as the second division soccer league in germany , predicted that both would face a rosier economic future over the next few years thanks to rising revenues and sinking costs . presented in frankfurt on monday , the survey found that club managers rated the current financial situation much more positively than last year .
two-thirds of those polled expected a better fiscal result for the 2004/2005 season and 53 percent said they were counting on soaring revenues in the coming season .
most of the hopes are pinned on sponsorship deals : 64 percent said they expected incomes to rise in that area . tv rights hampering earnings at the same time , the survey singled out television broadcast rights for putting a brake on otherwise much higher dividends for germany 's top soccer clubs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public broadcaster ard snapped up all the rights to the bundesliga last year for a pittance the rather meager revenues from television rights as compared with other european top-flight leagues , could in future seriously endanger the sports quality of the bundesliga , the study warned , adding that it could turn the german top league into a financial straggler on an international level . the study 's pessimism is lent credence by estimates that cash flows from television rights in the coming season will bring the 36 bundesliga clubs a total of around 195 million euros -lrb- $ 237.086 million -rrb- .
in comparison , britain 's premier league receives over 710 million euros , the italian and french leagues 550 million euros each . a break down of those figures by a further estimation show that the italian top soccer league champion can count on 111 million euros from its national tv broadcast deals in the next season , while the german champ will have to contend with a mere 16 million euros . fans must begin paying to watch the main reason for the relatively low dividends from television broadcast rights is the low penetration of pay-tv in germany . the possibility of seeing bundesliga highlights on saturday evenings on the hugely popular sportschau program on free public service broadcaster ard has drastically reduced the attractiveness of premiere , the only pay-tv channel in germany , the study said . " at the same time significant revenue hikes can only be possible via pay-tv , " said arnd hovemann of ernst & young .
" the german television viewers have to change their viewing habits , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : watching bundesliga highlights is a free affair in germany he added that the average german tv viewer still had a paradisiacal situation when it came to program offerings and speedy match coverage , referring to the sportschau on free-tv .
hovemann however said that paradise would have to end and fans would have to pay to watch , stressing that they would be compensated for it by increased quality in the bundesliga . that stance was echoed by karl-heinz rummenigge , a former national player and current executive chairman of bayern munich , who lashed out last month at the ard 's " it 's-cool-to-be-stingy " price for snapping up broadcasting rights for the bundesliga last year and the widespread popularity of its sportschau program in germany . in an interview with newspaper süddeutsche zeitung , rummenigge admitted that the weekly sportschau served its purpose well and was good and serious in its reporting , but added that the ard had to ready to dig much deeper into its pockets if the bundesliga was to remain competitive and retain top-notch players . " with this -lrb- financial -rrb- game that we 're playing here , television is undoubtedly an important pillar , " rummenige said .
" it 's always nice to say that the fan wants to see his sportschau at 8.15 p.m.
but then somebody has to tell me how we 're going to finance this place here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , far right , the bayern boss added that boosting pay-tv was of utmost importance . " the bundesliga has to be interested in strengthening georg kofler 's -lrb- head of premiere -rrb- pay-tv , " rummenige said .
" premiere currently has around 3.25 million subscribers - that 's a positive trend but it 's still far removed from the seven million that bskyb has in england . " more business savvy needed however , the soccer researchers are clear that even if the television deal for the 2006/2007 season significantly increased revenues , the earnings of top german clubs would still be nowhere close to their european counterparts .
that 's because of skewed revenue distribution rules in germany among the soccer clubs which are not in direct proportion to a club 's performance on the field . " the bundesliga has to decide whether it wants to cling to the principle of solidarity or whether it wants to retains financial competition among the top german club on a european level by changing current distribution rules , " hovemann said .
" both are n't possible . " the study also advises the top clubs to roll back costs in the short term , particularly on personnel and player transfers .
much like before , most clubs are outfitted with too little personal capital , the study said , adding that many still boast intangible assets such as players with high market value and club brands . most clubs in germany are also moving away from traditional bank loans and looking at alternative ways to finance themselves , according to the study . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de borussia on the brink borussia dortmund , germany 's only publicly listed soccer club , said thursday it was teetering on the edge of financial collapse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 " every soldier is aware of that risk " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers in kabul after a blast which killed two german soldiers in northern afghanistan last weekend , dw-world spoke with a german military official stationed in kunduz about the duties and dangers of peacekeeping . on monday , german defense minister peter struck said he had no reason to believe the explosion in a munitions warehouse that killed the german soldiers and five afghans was an attack .
" there are no indications of an attack and we continue to assume it was an accident , " struck told reporters at the time .
yet the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which the soldiers were part of , requested an investigation to rule out a deliberate attack .
a report is due by the end of the week on the deaths of the soldiers , who were part of an isaf contingent observing ammunition-sorting operations .
germany is the biggest single contributor to isa .
some 2,000 of the 8,300 troops on the ground there are german . dw-world spoke with commander roland vogler-wander , the bundeswehr 's spokesman in kunduz .
dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .
what normally takes place in such an action ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers marching in afghanistan the arms are laid out , registered , and loaded onto the truck .
anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck visited kabul in 2002 it is risky if the munitions are n't properly stored .
for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?
we live here in a camp with 300 people .
we are always together .
we eat together , we work together , we have leisure time together .
losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .
i knew the people who died and the ones who were injured .
i spoke with them frequently .
it certainly does affect one personally .
what will the consequences be for the bundeswehr after the accident ?
we have to live with the fact that there is a certain amount of risk involved .
as soldiers , we know that and we are trained for it .
we are prepared for the fact , and defense minister struck has also clearly said , that we have to be ready to accept the fact that in this deployment , a soldier can lose his life .
what other conditions make this a difficult deployment ?
the climate .
its almost 50 degrees here right now .
the bad roads and the infrastructure make it difficult .
but i prefer to see these difficulties as challenges .
what is the biggest challenge ?
in my view ?
that we reach our goal , which is to help the afghan government to achieve stability .
i think we 're on the right path . interview conducted by christiane wolters -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

" there are no indications of an attack and we continue to assume it was an accident , " struck told reporters at the time .
yet the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which the soldiers were part of , requested an investigation to rule out a deliberate attack .
a report is due by the end of the week on the deaths of the soldiers , who were part of an isaf contingent observing ammunition-sorting operations .
germany is the biggest single contributor to isa .
some 2,000 of the 8,300 troops on the ground there are german . dw-world spoke with commander roland vogler-wander , the bundeswehr 's spokesman in kunduz .
dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .
what normally takes place in such an action ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers marching in afghanistan the arms are laid out , registered , and loaded onto the truck .
anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck visited kabul in 2002 it is risky if the munitions are n't properly stored .
for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?
we live here in a camp with 300 people .
we are always together .
we eat together , we work together , we have leisure time together .
losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .
i knew the people who died and the ones who were injured .
i spoke with them frequently .
it certainly does affect one personally .
what will the consequences be for the bundeswehr after the accident ?
we have to live with the fact that there is a certain amount of risk involved .
as soldiers , we know that and we are trained for it .
we are prepared for the fact , and defense minister struck has also clearly said , that we have to be ready to accept the fact that in this deployment , a soldier can lose his life .
what other conditions make this a difficult deployment ?
the climate .
its almost 50 degrees here right now .
the bad roads and the infrastructure make it difficult .
but i prefer to see these difficulties as challenges .
what is the biggest challenge ?
in my view ?
that we reach our goal , which is to help the afghan government to achieve stability .

dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .

anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?

for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?

losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .

" i can not explain how this blunder came about , " pfahls , who is also a former head of the german domestic intelligence agency , told the court .
" i somehow got caught up in things . " bribes and gun-running bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfahls is actually on trial over a separate affair .
he is accused of taking nearly two million euros in bribes for the sale of 36 armored vehicles to saudi arabia in 1991 , and failing to declare the earnings . the presiding judge at the court in the southern city of augsburg , maximilian hofmeister , said pfahls could face a relatively lenient sentence of two years and three months in prison if he delivered a full confession . " this will not be a short trial , " hofmeister said .
" but it does not have to be excessively long .
that depends on you , mr pfahls . " confession hofmeister said that the defendant had made statements to authorities ahead of the trial that were tantamount to a confession and said that those statements should now be repeated before the court . prosecutors believe pfahls accepted bribe money from schreiber in a swiss bank account during the 1991 gulf war for helping german industrial giant thyssen obtain the armored vehicle contract . after five years on the run , pfahls was arrested in paris by french and german police in july last year . he initially opposed his extradition to germany but later relented , claiming the conditions at the sante prison in the french capital were " untenable and unacceptable .

" but it does not have to be excessively long .
that depends on you , mr pfahls .

" bad timing for opposition the trial comes as germany heads into a national election in september , reviving old questions about campaign financing scandals during the kohl era . his defense lawyers said tuesday they would like to invite kohl and former foreign ministers klaus kinkel and hans-dietrich genscher to testify about the sale of the armored vehicles to saudi arabia . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fugitive pfahls comes home - to prison former junior cabinet minister holger pfahls , one of germany ’ s most wanted men , was returned to the country thursday after being captured in france last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.06.2005 the demise of germany 's pedestrian zones großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the ultimate shopping experience hamburg has its port , frankfurt its banks and cologne its cathedral .
but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .
maybe they had their first kiss on a warm summer evening at the fountain along the quiet cobblestone streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people often beg in pedestrian zones but now , in economically difficult times , their atmosphere has suffered and these car-free areas appear dreary and shabby .
junk and penny pincher shops are driving out long-established stores , with homeless people meeting in front of the town hall for their first beer at ten in the morning .
creating a modern city the pedestrian zone was born in the central german city of kassel .
over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .
the attitude of the 1950s kassel 's pedestrian zone , the treppenstrasse , opened in 1953 and quickly became a national attraction .
in the same year , stuttgart and kiel began building car-free shopping areas and over the next few years , most other german cities followed suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most pedestrian zones are packed with shoppers on the weekend often , existing streets were simply blocked for cars and made into pedestrian zones .
but in kassel , this area was designed solely for this purpose , with a combination of simple architecture , fountains and green spaces , reminiscent of the postwar german 's idea of a mediterranean piazza .
" it is n't bombastic , but rather has a lightness , charm and liveliness to it , like the attitude to life in the 1950s , " said christian kopetzki , a professor of urban planning at the university of kassel .
" it was so to speak a reflex to overcome the horrors before it .
you find that in that architecture . "
from a pretty girl to an aging matron today , the concrete is slowly crumbling .
the architecture appears somewhat stale and the store areas are too small for the shopping adventure these days , said kassel optician hans uwe hess .
part of the city 's famous treppenstrasse now houses junk shops , where everything only costs one euro , and dim bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the place to go " it was once a pretty young girl and today , it 's more of a matron , who 's no longer as neat as she should be , " hess said .
" it 's not as interesting to look at anymore . "
kassel is not alone in this development .
many pedestrian zones in major and smaller cities are no longer living up to their colorful history .
perhaps the problem lies in the country 's failing economy .
germany can simply no longer keep its promise of mass consumption , which these areas used to represent . kerstin hilt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .

germany has questioned a british proposal that the g8 nations double their development aid .
chancellor schröder 's africa advisor said that a sudden increase in foreign aid to african countries would be counterproductive . leaders at the upcoming g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland will also be discussing how to help africa defeat poverty and embark on a journey of rapid growth .
britain is expected to put forward a plan envisaging the doubling of development aid to africa to $ 25 billion -lrb- 20.6 billion euros -rrb- in the near future .
but german chancellor gerhard schröder 's advisor on africa policy , uschi eid , said the plan does not come at the right time .
" without strong institutions and professional capacities , a doubling of aid is not very useful , " eid said .
" of course , we want to double development assistance to africa .
but this must be done step by step to be able to make the reforms work and to make sure the necessary infrastructure is put in place . "
eid was speaking after a meeting with wiseman nkuhlu , the executive director of africa 's homegrown nepad initiative , in berlin on monday .
fragile reforms in africa founded in 2001 , nepad aims to revitalize the continent 's ailing economy by attracting private investors with progress in conflict resolution and improved transparency .
the organization received full backing from the group of eight in 2002 and pledges from rich countries to support the initiative with billions of dollars in financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack of clean water is a major problem in developing countries eid said that enormous progress had been made in a number of countries under the nepad initiative .
germany 's plan to double aid to africa in the next 10 years , she said , was better suited to achieve the ambitious goals in health , education and poverty reduction .
but nkuhlu disagreed .
" i 'm convinced that there 's a large number of african countries that can absorb increased levels of development assistance , " nkuhlu said .
he said it was critical that industrialized nations strongly aid those countries that are making progress .
" but the reforms in a number of countries in africa are still very fragile because the majority of african countries are too poor to really deliver on promises to their people , " he added .
better access to markets nkuhlu said he hoped that the issue of increased assistance would be on the agenda in gleneagles regardless of the resistance of some industrialized countries .
he said it was now critically important that the g8 pledged further support for the reform process in africa .
" the question of access to markets is also critical , " nkuhlu said .
" africa needs to increase production .
that 's a major issue in terms of progress . "
germany has supported nepad with 2.5 billion euros over the past three years .
it is especially active in the field of conflict resolution , promoting good governance , water management and private sector investment .
the german government , however , wants to see greater progress in the field of political reforms and democracy .
eid praised nepad 's peer review mechanism under which african countries assess each other 's performance in these areas .
she stressed , though , that recent delays in the publication of the first national reports regarding ghana and rwanda must be made up for quickly . uwe hessler -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin have brushed back charges from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 " every soldier is aware of that risk " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldiers in kabul after a blast which killed two german soldiers in northern afghanistan last weekend , dw-world spoke with a german military official stationed in kunduz about the duties and dangers of peacekeeping . on monday , german defense minister peter struck said he had no reason to believe the explosion in a munitions warehouse that killed the german soldiers and five afghans was an attack .
" there are no indications of an attack and we continue to assume it was an accident , " struck told reporters at the time .
yet the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which the soldiers were part of , requested an investigation to rule out a deliberate attack .
a report is due by the end of the week on the deaths of the soldiers , who were part of an isaf contingent observing ammunition-sorting operations .
germany is the biggest single contributor to isa .
some 2,000 of the 8,300 troops on the ground there are german . dw-world spoke with commander roland vogler-wander , the bundeswehr 's spokesman in kunduz .
dw-world : on saturday , two german soldiers were killed in a disarmament action .
how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .
we try to minimize the risk to the extent possible .
but you can not rule out that something will happen .
the accident happened during a disarmament action .
what normally takes place in such an action ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers marching in afghanistan the arms are laid out , registered , and loaded onto the truck .
anything that can no longer be used by the afghan army is then destroyed and disposed of .
the unusual case that led to the accident involved piram qul , one of the ex commanders of the northern alliance .
of course , he had a lot of armaments .
but now he wants to run in the parliamentary elections , and whoever wants to run in that race is no longer allowed to have weapons .
that 's why the weapons collection was taking place in this case .
how does the bundeswehr know where the weapons are ?
we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .
if someone charges him with being in possession of more weapons , he is taken off the list of candidates .
of course , right now it is interesting for the warlords to get into the political process .
we see that as a big opportunity .
so you 're saying , giving up one 's weapons is voluntary ?
right .
there 's no coercion .
what kinds of weapons are we talking about here ?
mostly small-caliber weapons , such as machine guns like kalashnikovs .
there are bazookas , light weight ordnance , anti-aircraft guns , which were used in the civil war or in the mujaheddin against the russians .
do delicate situations often come up during these disarmament actions ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck visited kabul in 2002 it is risky if the munitions are n't properly stored .
for example , when the safety has already been pulled on a mine .
of course , then it is dangerous .
but our people are trained to the point that they can recognize this danger and say , ' we wo n't touch this one . '
the disarmament of militias are considered the main job of the peacekeepers in afghanistan .
how far along are they ?
there are many , many arms in afghanistan .
but i always say , every weapon that is turned in , makes afghanistan a bit safer .
and every firearm that no longer is in the hands of the wrong people , but that goes to the government , adds to the further stability and also to the improvement of the country .
how do the people of afghanistan view the deployed bundeswehr soldiers ?
positively .
the people do n't want any more arms .
they do n't want warlords .
they want to live in peace and quiet and want stability and political co-determination .
they are pleading for it .
what 's the mood among the troops after the accident on saturday ?
we live here in a camp with 300 people .
we are always together .
we eat together , we work together , we have leisure time together .
losing a colleague is very oppressive , and it hurts .
i knew the people who died and the ones who were injured .
i spoke with them frequently .
it certainly does affect one personally .
what will the consequences be for the bundeswehr after the accident ?
we have to live with the fact that there is a certain amount of risk involved .
as soldiers , we know that and we are trained for it .
we are prepared for the fact , and defense minister struck has also clearly said , that we have to be ready to accept the fact that in this deployment , a soldier can lose his life .
what other conditions make this a difficult deployment ?
the climate .
its almost 50 degrees here right now .
the bad roads and the infrastructure make it difficult .
but i prefer to see these difficulties as challenges .
what is the biggest challenge ?
in my view ?
that we reach our goal , which is to help the afghan government to achieve stability .
i think we 're on the right path . interview conducted by christiane wolters -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de goals and glory among the rubble german soccer coach holger obermann has been sporting ambassador to afghanistan since 2003 , his latest third world soccer project .

how dangerous is it to be a bundeswehr soldier in afghanistan ?
vogler-wander : the soldiers here come into contact with armaments and munitions that have been buried for decades , that were n't correctly stored .
of course there is a risk .
every soldier who comes here is aware of that risk .
they are also especially prepared and educated for it - they learn how to deal with mines , or in special situations .

we do n't know .
the afghans tell us .
as i said , when someone wants to run for election , he has to give up his weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 germany takes shaky route to early polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder handed in his request for a vote of confidence the head of germany 's ruling social democrats has called on his party 's members of parliament to abstain from the upcoming vote of confidence , that would ensure federal elections will be brought forward by a year . the head of germany 's ruling social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- franz müntefering has asked his party 's members of parliament to abstain in this friday 's vote of confidence in parliament , the first step towards dissolving the parliament and paving the way for early federal elections .
this would demonstrate that the chancellor no longer has majority backing within his own coalition government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu celebrates victory in north rhine-westphalia chancellor gerhard schröder himself had announced his desire for early elections after a landslide victory for the opposition christian democrats in germany ’ s most populous federal state and long a spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , last month .
the humiliating defeat prompted the chancellor , by his own admission , to seek a new mandate for his government 's unpopular economic reforms .
although müntefering will still have to persuade parliamentarians to abstain , it looks almost certain that this will be the way the ruling social democrats will comply with the chancellor 's wish to have early elections on september 18 this year .
abstaining is the best solution an earlier suggestion according to which social democrat cabinet ministers would have had to abstain from voting has meanwhile been thrown overboard .
that solution would have come across as too much of a political farce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and schröder however , müntefering 's proposal could also appear ridiculous , if implemented , with the ruling coalition likely to push through a series of bills on thursday with a stable majority .
but senior spd member gernot erler defended the plan .
" if some 200 mps from the spd abstain from the vote , it should be easier for the federal president to see that early elections are supported by a strong majority , " said erler .
" this move would not be as tricky as forcing a couple of social democrat cabinet members to abstain .
so , i think this is the best solution to pave the way for dissolving parliament . "
will the greens play the game ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler german president horst köhler will have to give the go-ahead for dissolving parliament , should the chancellor lose the vote of confidence as planned .
the spd ’ s junior coalition partner , the ecologist greens , haven ’ t decided yet whether they 're willing to play along . " the idea of having early elections was n't ours to start with , " said claudia roth , the greens ' party co-leader .
" but since this is the wish of the chancellor , we 'll try and not stand in the way , also considering the strong wish for early elections among the population . "
according to roth , the greens mps may also abstain from voting .
but it was still too early to say what they will actually do .
" it 's been common practice in our party to first debate things thoroughly within our parliamentary group , " said roth .
an artificial confidence vote ?
uncertainties will remain on the bumpy road to early elections .
even if president köhler agrees to dissolve parliament , the social democrats may trip over the legal aspects of their political gamble .
müntefering ’ s proposal may raise the eyebrows of judges at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
some smaller parties , which are not represented in the federal parliament , have already announced they plan to take the matter before the karlsruhe court .
they do n't believe it 's legitimate to bring about an artificial vote of confidence and rig its outcome in advance , while at the same the ruling government adopts bills with a stable majority of its own .
but the spd 's erler does n't accept such arguments .
" we 're confident that with our planned procedure , the likelihood of early elections being accepted by the constitutional court in karlsruhe will increase , " said erler .

this would demonstrate that the chancellor no longer has majority backing within his own coalition government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu celebrates victory in north rhine-westphalia chancellor gerhard schröder himself had announced his desire for early elections after a landslide victory for the opposition christian democrats in germany ’ s most populous federal state and long a spd stronghold , north rhine-westphalia , last month .
the humiliating defeat prompted the chancellor , by his own admission , to seek a new mandate for his government 's unpopular economic reforms .
although müntefering will still have to persuade parliamentarians to abstain , it looks almost certain that this will be the way the ruling social democrats will comply with the chancellor 's wish to have early elections on september 18 this year .
abstaining is the best solution an earlier suggestion according to which social democrat cabinet ministers would have had to abstain from voting has meanwhile been thrown overboard .
that solution would have come across as too much of a political farce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering and schröder however , müntefering 's proposal could also appear ridiculous , if implemented , with the ruling coalition likely to push through a series of bills on thursday with a stable majority .
but senior spd member gernot erler defended the plan .
" if some 200 mps from the spd abstain from the vote , it should be easier for the federal president to see that early elections are supported by a strong majority , " said erler .
" this move would not be as tricky as forcing a couple of social democrat cabinet members to abstain .
so , i think this is the best solution to pave the way for dissolving parliament . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst köhler german president horst köhler will have to give the go-ahead for dissolving parliament , should the chancellor lose the vote of confidence as planned .
the spd ’ s junior coalition partner , the ecologist greens , haven ’ t decided yet whether they 're willing to play along . " the idea of having early elections was n't ours to start with , " said claudia roth , the greens ' party co-leader .
" but since this is the wish of the chancellor , we 'll try and not stand in the way , also considering the strong wish for early elections among the population . "
according to roth , the greens mps may also abstain from voting .
but it was still too early to say what they will actually do .
" it 's been common practice in our party to first debate things thoroughly within our parliamentary group , " said roth .
an artificial confidence vote ?
uncertainties will remain on the bumpy road to early elections .
even if president köhler agrees to dissolve parliament , the social democrats may trip over the legal aspects of their political gamble .
müntefering ’ s proposal may raise the eyebrows of judges at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
some smaller parties , which are not represented in the federal parliament , have already announced they plan to take the matter before the karlsruhe court .
they do n't believe it 's legitimate to bring about an artificial vote of confidence and rig its outcome in advance , while at the same the ruling government adopts bills with a stable majority of its own .
but the spd 's erler does n't accept such arguments .
" we 're confident that with our planned procedure , the likelihood of early elections being accepted by the constitutional court in karlsruhe will increase , " said erler .

but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .
maybe they had their first kiss on a warm summer evening at the fountain along the quiet cobblestone streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people often beg in pedestrian zones but now , in economically difficult times , their atmosphere has suffered and these car-free areas appear dreary and shabby .
junk and penny pincher shops are driving out long-established stores , with homeless people meeting in front of the town hall for their first beer at ten in the morning .
creating a modern city the pedestrian zone was born in the central german city of kassel .
over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .
the attitude of the 1950s kassel 's pedestrian zone , the treppenstrasse , opened in 1953 and quickly became a national attraction .
in the same year , stuttgart and kiel began building car-free shopping areas and over the next few years , most other german cities followed suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most pedestrian zones are packed with shoppers on the weekend often , existing streets were simply blocked for cars and made into pedestrian zones .
but in kassel , this area was designed solely for this purpose , with a combination of simple architecture , fountains and green spaces , reminiscent of the postwar german 's idea of a mediterranean piazza .
" it is n't bombastic , but rather has a lightness , charm and liveliness to it , like the attitude to life in the 1950s , " said christian kopetzki , a professor of urban planning at the university of kassel .
" it was so to speak a reflex to overcome the horrors before it .
you find that in that architecture . "
from a pretty girl to an aging matron today , the concrete is slowly crumbling .
the architecture appears somewhat stale and the store areas are too small for the shopping adventure these days , said kassel optician hans uwe hess .
part of the city 's famous treppenstrasse now houses junk shops , where everything only costs one euro , and dim bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the place to go " it was once a pretty young girl and today , it 's more of a matron , who 's no longer as neat as she should be , " hess said .
" it 's not as interesting to look at anymore . "
kassel is not alone in this development .
many pedestrian zones in major and smaller cities are no longer living up to their colorful history .
perhaps the problem lies in the country 's failing economy .
germany can simply no longer keep its promise of mass consumption , which these areas used to represent . kerstin hilt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young germans prove big spenders germans have long been accused of being too prudent when it comes to spending .
but the same ca n't be said of the country 's children and teenagers who are displaying a huge appetite for buying clothes and accessories .

germany are a very tough nut to crack . " " we have a mountain to climb playing against the hosts in front of their home fans in a sell-out stadium , " mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said . confed cup top attack versus top defense the third-placed game promises to be a cracking encounter in leipzig .
germany have the highest-scoring attack of the tournament while mexico have the strongest defense .
the german have scored eleven goals in their last four games while mexico have conceded only two . for the germans , they know they must go out on a high as a nation expects . " the players must give their all one more time , " klinsmann concluded .

but in their core , all german cities look alike .
their true souls lie in their pedestrian zones .
but is this german institution facing extinction ? the idea was simple .
shortly after the end of world war ii , german city developers said cars should be banned from the city centers , giving pedestrians the chance to leisurely walk through downtown in peace .
shopping and , of course , spending money , was much easier if you could just stroll from one shop window to the next without dealing with traffic .
the pedestrian zones were the symbol of germany 's economic miracle .
they belonged to german everyday life just like the country 's new postwar currency , the deutsche mark , and the volkswagen beetle .
seductive shopping hartmut häussermann , professor of urban sociology at humboldt university in berlin , was a little boy when the first pedestrian zones emerged in germany .
" what makes these areas so uniform is that they all wanted the same thing , " häussermann said .
" people were supposed to go into town , look into shop windows and always see the same thing .
they were enticed and seduced into buying these things . "
for many germans growing up during the country 's boom years , pedestrian zones were the place they ate their first ice-cream and bought their first pair of shoes .
maybe they had their first kiss on a warm summer evening at the fountain along the quiet cobblestone streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people often beg in pedestrian zones but now , in economically difficult times , their atmosphere has suffered and these car-free areas appear dreary and shabby .
junk and penny pincher shops are driving out long-established stores , with homeless people meeting in front of the town hall for their first beer at ten in the morning .
creating a modern city the pedestrian zone was born in the central german city of kassel .
over 60 years ago , kassel prided itself on its wilhelminian style old town - until october 22 , 1943 , when british bombers destroyed 80 percent of the city .
it was a catastrophe for the population , but a one-time opportunity for city planners .
kassel had always lacked a direct connection from the main railway station to the center square .
now , they could build a straight aisle through the rubble piles .
" in this sense , the second world war with its destruction of city centers was a welcome sight for urban planners , as it gave them the chance to re-plan cities according to a modern image , " häussermann said .
this new cityscape was to be one that no longer combined various aspects of daily life .
" a modern city had to be one where traffic had its own space , where shopping had its own areas and where living space was separate , so that this overlap in a limited district was de-concentrated , " he added .
the attitude of the 1950s kassel 's pedestrian zone , the treppenstrasse , opened in 1953 and quickly became a national attraction .
in the same year , stuttgart and kiel began building car-free shopping areas and over the next few years , most other german cities followed suit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most pedestrian zones are packed with shoppers on the weekend often , existing streets were simply blocked for cars and made into pedestrian zones .
but in kassel , this area was designed solely for this purpose , with a combination of simple architecture , fountains and green spaces , reminiscent of the postwar german 's idea of a mediterranean piazza .
" it is n't bombastic , but rather has a lightness , charm and liveliness to it , like the attitude to life in the 1950s , " said christian kopetzki , a professor of urban planning at the university of kassel .
" it was so to speak a reflex to overcome the horrors before it .
you find that in that architecture . "
from a pretty girl to an aging matron today , the concrete is slowly crumbling .
the architecture appears somewhat stale and the store areas are too small for the shopping adventure these days , said kassel optician hans uwe hess .
part of the city 's famous treppenstrasse now houses junk shops , where everything only costs one euro , and dim bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer the place to go " it was once a pretty young girl and today , it 's more of a matron , who 's no longer as neat as she should be , " hess said .

kassel is not alone in this development .

the architecture appears somewhat stale and the store areas are too small for the shopping adventure these days , said kassel optician hans uwe hess .

" it 's not as interesting to look at anymore . "
kassel is not alone in this development .
many pedestrian zones in major and smaller cities are no longer living up to their colorful history .
perhaps the problem lies in the country 's failing economy .

the hosts are determined to get something out of their campaign , even if it is just third place . while the trophy is going to be in the hands of another captain on wednesday evening , germany skipper michael ballack and his team mates are determined to end their country 's participation in the confederations cup on a high . germany face mexico in leipzig on wednesday in the play-off for third place between the two group winners who were knocked out at the semi-final stage . " the public in leipzig can expect to see a tremendous game , " said german coach jürgen klinsmann .
" this will be another interesting test for our team . " the hosts will face a tough time against the mexicans who narrowly went out of the competition the day after germany lost 3-2 to brazil on saturday .
mexico were cruelly dumped out of the confed cup in a dramatic penalty shoot-out on sunday with argentina 's esteban cambiasso scoring the winning spot-kick after keeper german lux had saved ricardo osorio 's penalty . mexico held their own and even mastered the tournament favorites at times , adding weight to the growing sense that they could be a surprise package at the world cup in germany next summer .

mexico 's only win dates back almost exactly 20 years to june 15 , 1985 , when they defeated germany 2-0 in mexico city . the germans , under berti vogts , won the last match , a knock-out stage game at the 1998 fifa world cup in france .
mexico lost that match in montpellier 2-1 , going down , ironically , to goals from klinsmann and bierhoff . mexico cautious but focused on winning mexico have come a long way since then and are determined not to roll over in the face of a partisan crowd and a home side with high ambitions .

so what 's going on ? green cars the main uses for these natural ingredients are door cladding , seatback linings , seat bottoms , back cushions , head rests , under floor body panels and flexible tubing . " natural fibers derived from wood can be used for package shelves , for example " said wulf-peter schmidt from the ford plant in cologne .
" we also use less traditional materials such as kenaf , which is a member of the mallow family .

" we check susceptibility to rupture , reaction to climate change and high temperature - the same tests we do on other materials , " he said . according to thiemann from daimler chrysler , the tests are even more rigorous than those run on synthetic materials .

can they win ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt -lrb- right -rrb- congratulates helmut kohl -lrb- left -rrb- after the latter was elected chancellor when schmidt lost a vote of confidence in parliament in 1982 these parliamentarians would only be able to start legal action after the president dissolved the bundestag .
in its judgment , the court would certainly refer to its 1983 decision .
-lrb- editor 's note : shortly after his election as chancellor by parliament , helmut kohl " used " the vote of confidence in january 1983 to have a new bundestag elected . -rrb-
it was a similar situation .
then the court drafted guidelines to article 68 and made clear that - even if everyone wants them - article 68 is not a suitable route to new elections .
the disruption between the parliamentary majority and the chancellor is necessary .
if it ca n't be verified - and the result of the vote is n't proof since it can be faked - the constitutional court will determine that -lrb- the vote of no confidence -rrb- was unconstitutional .
how can the rift be verified ? in 1983 , the court stuck to things that had been said and written in public .
besides that the president held talks with the party and parliamentary group leaders .
based on the publicized material and these talks , the court gained the impression that , yes , it ca n't continue . how does the situation today differ from the situation in 1983 ? then , the situation had already been manipulated and , i think , should not have been allowed to reach dissolution of parliament .
the constitutional court had set strict guidelines but did n't adhere to them .
then we at least had documented statements from the fdp -lrb- the governing coalition partner -rrb- that said : " we only want to cooperate with the chancellor , who attained office through a vote of no confidence , for a limited amount of time . "
the court took that seriously and classified it as a crisis situation .
but today the situation is not at all comparable . what is your view of some ministers ' intentions to possibly abstain in the july 1 vote of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german cabinet during a retreat in 2003 if the vote of no confidence comes through only because the ministers abstain , the supposition of manipulation stands to reason .
of all people the most loyal of the loyal fail , abstain from voting and thus a majority against the chancellor is achieved .
that 's not a disruption .
i can only warn against such a step because it would document that the whole thing was a fake . should n't schröder just resign ? i understand why schröder has n't chosen the resignation route .
schröder is saying that he 'd like to continue but he 's unsure as to whether the voters support him .
but he can not ask the voters whether they still want him by resigning .
for , resignation does n't lead directly to new elections .
only if the bundestag repeatedly fails to elect a new chancellor does the dissolution of parliament become an option .
but it 's very vague and a complicated and protracted route .
if he were to resign , it would mean he gave up . what do you think would be the best way to bring about fresh elections ? one could initiate the bundestag 's right to self-dissolution .
that 's an entirely unsuspicious instrument .
it envisages that the bundestag decides on its dissolution with a qualified majority .
but strangely there are reservations about employing it .
i do n't know who 's afraid of what . the former president of the constitutional court , ernst benda , has criticized the attempt to bring on new elections using the vote of confidence .
he says it gives the impression that politicians see the constitution only as a " cumbersome obstacle . "
what do you think ? i have nothing to add .
it does n't only give that impression ; the impression has been made .
all parties are now preparing their election campaigns .
the opposition 's reaction to the chancellor 's announcement to bring about new elections was hectic .
instantly , they designated a candidate for chancellor .
i think it 's ridiculous .
this knee-jerk start of the election campaign shows how little the constitution is taken seriously .
if the bundestag is n't dissolved in the end , it will be an incredible disgrace . steffen leidel interviewed christian pestalozza -lrb- ncy -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.06.2005 road to early polls fraught with obstacles 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will actually be hoping for defeat on friday hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .
dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .
the assumption is that the chancellor hopes he will indeed be accorded parliament 's confidence .
but the constitution does n't forbid striving for clarification in a negative way .
it would n't be an abuse . when would it be an abuse ? one can speak of abuse if the chancellor and the majority of parliament try to establish a lack of confidence although they know for sure that they could continue to work together .
if they pronounce a lack of confidence aiming only to cause new elections , it would not be in the spirit of article 68 .
that would be manipulation . do you think there is a genuine lack of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag on top of the german parliament where ?
i ca n't see it .
criticism has come repeatedly from the parliamentary groups of the governing coalition , but that 's not enough .
the majority in the bundestag - which also requires several members from the government coalition - must say we can not work with this chancellor anymore .
i have n't seen this situation documented anywhere .
it must be verifiable .
i only see the usual conflicts .
if nothing happens , i ca n't see how they can use article 68 . assuming schröder is successful with his vote of no confidence , what will happen ? the chancellor must then ask the president to dissolve the bundestag .
he has three weeks to decide whether to dissolve it or not .
the president must first verify : is it a serious situation of lack of confidence ?
is there really a disruption and is the chancellor 's work hamstrung ?
the constitutional court has said that in resolving this legal question the president should take the chancellor 's assessment as the basis for his decision .
if the president goes along with the chancellor 's assessment , the question arises : does he order parliament to be dissolved ?
here the president has some discretionary scope .
even if he believes the preconditions of article 68 exist , he is n't obliged to dissolve parliament .
he can also say , " you must continue .

dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking . gerhard schröder set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism when he applied for a vote of confidence in the bundestag .
the chancellor hopes that parliament will reject him , allowing for new elections to take place in the fall .
dw-world talked to christian pestalozza , a professor of german constitutional law at berlin 's free university , about the complex and circuitous route schröder has taken to get his way . dw-world : for weeks germany has been arguing about whether schröder is abusing the concept of a vote of confidence to force new elections .
green party parliamentarian werner schulz , for example , has accused schröder of wanting to bend germany 's constitution as it suits him .
what do you think ? christian pestalozza : the vote of confidence is regulated in article 68 of the constitution .
it refers to an application from the federal chancellor to the bundestag -lrb- the lower house of parliament -rrb- to pronounce their confidence in him .
the prerequisite is that there 's a disruption or dispute between the chancellor and the parliamentary majority .
the vote of confidence is meant to create clarity for the chancellor who says : " now i want to know for sure whether we want to continue or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on friday , the german parliament will not have any empty chairs actually the constitution foresees an application aimed at a positive vote of confidence .
the assumption is that the chancellor hopes he will indeed be accorded parliament 's confidence .
but the constitution does n't forbid striving for clarification in a negative way .
it would n't be an abuse . when would it be an abuse ? one can speak of abuse if the chancellor and the majority of parliament try to establish a lack of confidence although they know for sure that they could continue to work together .
if they pronounce a lack of confidence aiming only to cause new elections , it would not be in the spirit of article 68 .
that would be manipulation . do you think there is a genuine lack of confidence ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german flag on top of the german parliament where ?
i ca n't see it .
criticism has come repeatedly from the parliamentary groups of the governing coalition , but that 's not enough .
the majority in the bundestag - which also requires several members from the government coalition - must say we can not work with this chancellor anymore .
i have n't seen this situation documented anywhere .
it must be verifiable .
i only see the usual conflicts .
if nothing happens , i ca n't see how they can use article 68 . assuming schröder is successful with his vote of no confidence , what will happen ? the chancellor must then ask the president to dissolve the bundestag .
he has three weeks to decide whether to dissolve it or not .
the president must first verify : is it a serious situation of lack of confidence ?
is there really a disruption and is the chancellor 's work hamstrung ?
the constitutional court has said that in resolving this legal question the president should take the chancellor 's assessment as the basis for his decision .
if the president goes along with the chancellor 's assessment , the question arises : does he order parliament to be dissolved ?
here the president has some discretionary scope .
even if he believes the preconditions of article 68 exist , he is n't obliged to dissolve parliament .
he can also say , " you must continue .
you -lrb- parliament -rrb- can elect a new chancellor with the -lrb- existing -rrb- majority . "

house of representatives minority leader francis escudero said the opposition bloc was considering pressing for mrs arroyo 's impeachment .
mrs arroyo on monday apologised to the nation , describing her action as a " lapse of judgement " .
but she denied claims of trying to rig the poll , saying she would not quit .
critics said a tape recording of a phone call between a woman sounding like her and an election commissioner was proof she tried to influence the vote .
" she -lsb- mrs arroyo -rsb- should ask herself if she still has the moral authority to lead the country , " mr escudero told dzbb radio .
however , he said it would be better if the president resigned of her own accord .
several other leading opposition politicians backed his call , vowing to pursue protests and legal steps against mrs arroyo .
arroyo 's defence in monday 's televised address the president did not directly refer to the tape recording , which was released to the media three weeks ago .
protests against mrs arroyo have been small-scale so far but she did say she had spoken to an election commissioner about her share of the vote in the may 2004 poll .
" i was anxious to protect my votes and during that time had conversations with many people , including a comelec -lrb- commission on elections -rrb- official , " she said .
" my intent was not to influence the outcome of the election and it did not . "
the president rejected calls to step down , saying the " outcome had been predicted by every major public opinion poll " and judged to be fair by international observers .
telephoning an election official during the vote is not illegal in the philippines , but the opposition is still likely to see it as a clear breach of conduct .
in the election , mrs arroyo beat the now-deceased film star fernando poe by more than a million votes .
in addition to the tape recording controversy , the president also faces separate allegations that members of her family took pay-offs from illegal gambling syndicates .
she is also losing popularity due to the poorly performing philippine economy , and proposed budget reforms .

every home in wales was revalued last year , with a third moving up at least one valuation band .
the lib dems said valuation office agency -lrb- voa -rrb- figures showed only 28 of 6,618 formal appeals have been dealt with since april .
the welsh assembly government said the voa 's appeals process was on schedule .
all of wales ' 1.3 million homes underwent revaluation by the voa throughout 2004 .
appeals ' backlog ' previously , council tax had been calculated using 1991 property values but it has now been set according to a home 's value as of 1 april , 2005 .
although about 33 % of properties moved up one band or more , 8 % also moved down .
mike german , leader of the lib dems in the assembly , claimed the backlog in formal appeals will not be cleared for up to 40 years if they continued to be handled at the same rate .
but an assembly government spokesman said : " the accusation that the appeals process will take 40 years is complete rubbish .

some residents of the pontcanna area of cardiff say they have been forced to carry umbrellas to deter low-flying attacks from the birds .
there are around 6,000 seagulls in cardiff , but the number is rising by 10 % each year .
it is believed the gulls are protecting newly-hatched chicks on roofs nearby .
' pecked heads ' gull attacks mainly take place over several weeks while the adult birds seek to protect their young from perceived threats .
rhodri john says he has been forced to go out with an umbrella pontcanna resident rhodri john said he , his wife and neighbours had all come under attack from the birds .
he added : " my next door neighbour and my wife go to work in the morning and they 've got the umbrella out to try to keep them away .
" they come so close they skim your head .
" the person who gets it mainly is the postman at the moment . "
another pontcanna resident , actress sharon morgan , said : " i always take the umbrella out with me and keep it in the car because they have swooped down on people and pecked people 's heads .
residents have been frightened by the low-flying gulls " this is just the beginning because the babies are still up in the chimneys somewhere . "
cardiff council said the problem was uk-wide , adding that it could offer advice but did not have a duty to deal with the gulls .
a rise in the urban gull population has seen a variety of methods employed to keep the birds under control in major population centres .
in recent years , a hawk has been employed in bristol and an owl in gloucester to scare the birds away from their nesting places .
last year in hastings , a robotic peregrine falcon was placed on the roof of a shopping centre and used to scare off seagulls and pigeons .

house of fraser said the deal would improve its national coverage and increase earnings .
the 168p-a-share offer represents a premium of 14.7 % to monday 's closing price and 44.8 % higher than before the firms said they were in talks .
tough trading house of fraser had a tough start to the year , reporting earlier this month that like-for-like sales fell 3.2 % in the first 19 weeks of its year .

the chain will make a £ 4m contribution into the beatties pension fund , with up to a further £ 9m payable over the following two years beatties shareholders holding a total of 10.6 % of the firm 's shares have voted in favour of the offer .

wolverhampton-based beatties , which began life as a drapers ' store , has 12 outlets across england .
under the terms of the deal , beatties shareholders will receive 168p a share , which values the business at about £ 69.4m -lrb- $ 126.3m -rrb- .
house of fraser said the deal would improve its national coverage and increase earnings .
the 168p-a-share offer represents a premium of 14.7 % to monday 's closing price and 44.8 % higher than before the firms said they were in talks .
tough trading house of fraser had a tough start to the year , reporting earlier this month that like-for-like sales fell 3.2 % in the first 19 weeks of its year .
the only place where the two firm 's stores overlap is birmingham .
house of fraser believes some of beatties properties are worth " significantly in excess " of the value shown in their accounts .
the chain will make a £ 4m contribution into the beatties pension fund , with up to a further £ 9m payable over the following two years beatties shareholders holding a total of 10.6 % of the firm 's shares have voted in favour of the offer .

ingrid lewis , who is town centre manager in colwyn bay , denied the scheme was going over the top .

shopkeepers in colwyn bay highlighted problems of vandalism , drugs , underage drinking , shouting and swearing in the area .
inspector gary ashton from north wales police is pleased with the scheme , which he said would stop people banned in one town simply travelling down the road to the next .
he said that antisocial behaviour was forcing retailers and pub owners to work together .
" it is the strength of the community being brought to bear against the individuals who engage in antisocial behaviour and disorder , " he said .
fiona evans , who manages a shop in colwyn bay , said the plan could great " big havoc " on the social lives of offenders .

troublemakers in shops could also be banned from pubs in a north wales town as well as stores in a nearby resort .
regular offenders who steal , swear or are violent towards staff are being targeted under the new scheme .
if people are banned from shops in colwyn bay , they will also be unable to visit pubs in the town , or shops five miles away in llandudno either .
organisers claim it is the first time in the uk that two towns have united to tackle anti-social behaviour .
ingrid lewis , who is town centre manager in colwyn bay , denied the scheme was going over the top .
" i do n't think so - let 's not forget these people are prolific offenders , " she said . ... and from shops in llandudno as well " they have n't just committed one offence in one day - they have committed offences over a period of time and frankly they deserve to be excluded .
" the ordinary man in the street , the ordinary shopper , wants to be in a nice safe environment - why should they mix with louts ? "
shopkeepers in colwyn bay highlighted problems of vandalism , drugs , underage drinking , shouting and swearing in the area .
inspector gary ashton from north wales police is pleased with the scheme , which he said would stop people banned in one town simply travelling down the road to the next .
he said that antisocial behaviour was forcing retailers and pub owners to work together .
" it is the strength of the community being brought to bear against the individuals who engage in antisocial behaviour and disorder , " he said .
fiona evans , who manages a shop in colwyn bay , said the plan could great " big havoc " on the social lives of offenders .
" hopefully it will divert them and make them realise they have got to behave like the rest of us do , " she said .
