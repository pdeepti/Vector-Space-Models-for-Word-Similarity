the dutch referendum is non-binding , but the main political parties have said they will take it into account when the text comes up for parliamentary approval if turnout exceeds 30 percent - even though , according to the prime minister , 85 percent of lawmakers support the constitution . balkenende hit out at the " no " camp for failing to suggest an alternative to the treaty , which aims to simplify decision-making in the 25-member eu , saying : " i have not heard anyone explain what should be renegotiated . " " a no to europe " from france a war of words is erupting in france as well in the final week before the vote .
former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , whose two prior campaign appearances earned high marks , urged his skeptical party faithful late thursday to join the " yes " camp , picking apart the arguments of treaty opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the " yes " vote pull it off in the final week ?
" to those who are tempted to vote no , i say that they have every chance of being deceived , " jospin told 3,000 socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters at a rally in the western city of nantes , warning against a protest vote to punish chirac . " if the french vote no , there will be no change in france , but just a no to europe , " the former prime minister cautioned . pollsters agree that left-leaning voters hold the key to the results on may 29 .
jospin and the ps leadership are campaigning for the constitution , while former prime minister laurent fabius leads the left 's " no " camp .
former communist party leader robert hue hit back at jospin on friday , condemning his " arrogance " and the " constant stream of chatter from the yes camp . " plan b option confuses the " no " camp has gained ground on talk of a possible " plan b " should the treaty be rejected - meaning its eventual renegotiation .
the bva survey showed that 69 percent of french people believe the charter can be rewritten . chirac , along with eu officials and other leaders , has repeatedly ruled out any renegotiation , a message hammered home on thursday during a summit with german chancellor gerhard schroeder and polish president aleksander kwasniewski in eastern france . the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the european union following expansion to the post-communist east , must be ratified by all 25 member states .

the g-14 are looking to have more say in international soccer management . the showcase of european club soccer , the champions league final on may 25 in istanbul , is just days away .
the two finalists , liverpool and ac milan , will reap great financial rewards for the grueling schedule against outstanding european competition .
but it wo n't be without a price .
after long , exhausting seasons with their domestic leagues , as well as appearances in international matches , the top-notch players that often compete in the champions league tournament run a high risk of injury .
in addition , their clubs are never compensated for the extra appearances .
if the organization that represents europe 's most prestigious clubs has its way , that will change .
the g-14 - named after the 14 original founders in 2000 - currently has no voice in the affairs of international soccer , neither at fifa nor at uefa , the european soccer body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing for english pride , here wayne rooney -lrb- right -rrb- and david beckham can have consequences for their clubs " at the moment , the clubs have no representation in the decision-making process , " said g-14 spokesman james thellusson .
" we think we should have a greater say . "
james thellusson made an analogy to the united states when it revolted against the british empire .
naturally , the club group has the role of the us and fifa stars as the tyrants .
waiting for decision the g-14 , which includes bayern munich , borussia dortmund and bayer leverkusen , has taken its case to the federal competition agency in switzerland , where fifa headquarters is located .
the g-14 aims for a ruling that would strike down fifa statutes and allow it to be officially recognized and given a voice at international soccer body .
the sticking points are matters like international scheduling or insurance costs that could arise if a player were to be injured in a match for his national team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian soccer player ronaldo plays for real madrid , one club in the g-14 the 18 european clubs are hopeful that the swiss will decide before the 2006 world cup , when fifa will distribute at least 332 million swiss francs -lrb- 215 million euros -rrb- to the 32 competing national soccer associations .
fifa reluctant to negotiate the conflict has been brewing for a number of years .
teams like manchester united , real madrid and inter milan from the g-14 are naturally interested in new sources of revenue for the services their players provide at big international tournaments .
after all , the presence of ronaldo , michael ballack or david beckham increases attendance - and potential profits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa boss sepp blatter is reluctant to negotiate with clubs yet fifa head sepp blatter has repeatedly said that his organization is the wrong one to be making demands to .
the national associations pick the players for their teams and fifa has made it clear that it is responsible to the national associations and not to a small group of european teams .
so the g-14 must wait and see how the swiss competition commission rules in a not so run-of-the-mill case that could possibly involve large sums of money . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsi wants confederations cup glory germany 's national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann has revealed his plans to win the confederations cup on home soil in june as a dress rehearsal for world cup glory in 2006 .

former german international lothar matthäus wants to help the cause of clubs from the former gdr . the fate of teams in eastern germany has become a personal mission of former german international midfielder and current coach of hungary 's national side , lothar matthäus .
matthäus is as bavarian as lederhosen and beer steins , but the desolate situation of professional soccer in the east has aroused his interest .
the only club in the first division , hansa rostock , has been relegated .
none of the four teams in the second league successfully made the jump up .
at one point in the season , all four squads were hovering near the relegation zone but with one game remaining , only erfurt looks to face demotion .
how to stop the movement west in his weekly article with the sport bild magazine , matthäus decided that lokomotive leipzig , once a top team in east german soccer , would receive his help .
due to licensing infractions , lok now rest -lrb- in peace -rrb- in the 11th division of german soccer .
more than 6,000 fans packed the small stadium to watch a player who at one time , according to matthäus , had been booed by the fans .
now he was their hero .
but the marketing gig ca n't take anything way from the catastrophic state of affairs in east german soccer .
young talent are leaving the east clubs in droves to sign more lucrative contracts with western teams .
for ulf kirsten , former national striker with both the gdr and then reunited germany there is only one solution .
" youth players from east clubs have to be prohibited from transferring , " said kirsten recently .

it 's symbolic of a new era that began in ukraine in the wake of the " orange revolution " protests last year that ousted former pro-russian prime minister and presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

it 's the first time the scroll goes on display outside israel . " the new hebrews , 100 years of art in israel " was been organized by the israel museum in jerusalem at berlin 's martin gropius bau exhibition hall to mark 40 years of diplomatic ties between israel and what was then west germany . the 3.6-meter-long -lrb- 12-foot-long -rrb- temple scroll , which is being shown outside israel for the first time , is one of the longest biblical texts found since the 1940s .
it is estimated to be about 2,120 years old . bedouins discovered it in 1956 in the judea desert of the qumran region , in caves overlooking the dead sea .
it later disappeared and was recovered by israel 's secret service in 1967 . israel 's mona lisa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cameraman films a work of art by israeli artist michal shamir named " wall-wound " " the dead sea scrolls are a mona lisa for our museum and for israel , " said james snyder , the director of the israel museum , as he presented the exhibition .
" they are one of the ancient seeds for what would become the flowering of modern israel . " snyder added it was appropriate to exhibit the scroll among artworks because of the importance of the discovery of the dead sea scrolls for contemporary israeli culture . 100 years of art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sculpture by israeli artist sigalit landau entitled " the plucker " a total of 700 artworks are on show , retracing in 15 chapters the evolution of israeli culture from the first waves of zionist immigration to palestine to the creation of the state of israel in 1948 and also takes in the intifada and the construction of the security barrier between israel and the palestinian territories . the show includes paintings , photographs , installations , architectural models and videos from over 130 artists .
the oldest works date from 1906 . the holocaust , however , plays a relatively minor role in the exhibition because the subject was for a long time taboo in israel , the exhibition 's curator , doreet levitte harten , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified man photographs two paintings by israeli artist gal weinstein that depict the dead sons uday -lrb- left -rrb- and qusay of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein the " passivity of the victims " was not compatible with the strident image the new state was trying to create and those who had suffered at the hands of the nazis did not want to discuss it , she added . the 1961 trial of top nazi official adolf eichmann was the trigger for israelis to begin discussing their experiences during world war ii , she added . a true miracle attending the official opening with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom thursday night , german interior minster otto schily said the exhibition clearly showed the significance of the holocaust for israel 's creative culture . " it truly is a miracle that we may speak of friendship between germany and israel despite the millions of murdered jews , " he said . the exhibition is open wednesdays through mondays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and runs until sept .

but officials are n't worrying - yet . in the coming weeks , the fate of the european constitution will rest in the hands of the netherlands and france , two nations that are at the moment extremely dissatisfied with the way their countries are being run .
that 's not good news for the government politicians who have been alternately coddling and bullying their voters in the past few weeks into approving the document that aims to streamline and simplify the european union , readying it for the challenges ahead . " i do not want to speculate about what will happen if the ' no ' wins , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , in an interview with the daily de volkskrant .
" i am putting my money on the ' yes ' vote .
i am optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende polls suggest that the " yes " camp is trailing in both france and ther netherlands .

only 47 percent approve of it .
in the netherlands , the numbers are 54 percent against the treaty and only 27 percent in favor of it ahead of the june 1 referendum .
observers say a " no " vote in france would stop the constitution dead in its tracks . referendum on dutch government as in france , where opposition to the treaty has fed off the government 's unpopularity , as well as anxiety over the eu 's expansion to the east and south , the dutch debate has been swayed by fears and concerns unrelated to the text . more than half of dutch " no " camp supporters said they wished to block turkey 's eu bid , while a quarter wanted to defy balkenende 's government .
the dutch referendum is non-binding , but the main political parties have said they will take it into account when the text comes up for parliamentary approval if turnout exceeds 30 percent - even though , according to the prime minister , 85 percent of lawmakers support the constitution . balkenende hit out at the " no " camp for failing to suggest an alternative to the treaty , which aims to simplify decision-making in the 25-member eu , saying : " i have not heard anyone explain what should be renegotiated . " " a no to europe " from france a war of words is erupting in france as well in the final week before the vote .
former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , whose two prior campaign appearances earned high marks , urged his skeptical party faithful late thursday to join the " yes " camp , picking apart the arguments of treaty opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the " yes " vote pull it off in the final week ?
" to those who are tempted to vote no , i say that they have every chance of being deceived , " jospin told 3,000 socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters at a rally in the western city of nantes , warning against a protest vote to punish chirac . " if the french vote no , there will be no change in france , but just a no to europe , " the former prime minister cautioned . pollsters agree that left-leaning voters hold the key to the results on may 29 .
jospin and the ps leadership are campaigning for the constitution , while former prime minister laurent fabius leads the left 's " no " camp .
former communist party leader robert hue hit back at jospin on friday , condemning his " arrogance " and the " constant stream of chatter from the yes camp . " plan b option confuses the " no " camp has gained ground on talk of a possible " plan b " should the treaty be rejected - meaning its eventual renegotiation .
the bva survey showed that 69 percent of french people believe the charter can be rewritten . chirac , along with eu officials and other leaders , has repeatedly ruled out any renegotiation , a message hammered home on thursday during a summit with german chancellor gerhard schroeder and polish president aleksander kwasniewski in eastern france . the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the european union following expansion to the post-communist east , must be ratified by all 25 member states .

financial market regulator bafin said thursday it had found signs that some hedge funds may have colluded in toppling deutsche börse 's chairman earlier this month , and that would oblige them to launch a full takeover bid for the stock market operator .
bafin , which announced last week that it was launching an investigation to find out whether the hedge funds had acted in concert to force chief executive officer werner seifert to quit , said it had found " indications " that a number of funds had colluded to block deutsche börse 's plans to buy the london stock exchange earlier this year .
bafin president jochen sanio told a news conference that the investigation would continue .
if , at the end of the day , it was found that collusion had taken place and if the funds held a combined stake more than 30 percent in the company , they could be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares in deutsche börse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.05.2005 -pipe- 11:00 utc ecb under fire again from germany the german government , facing a possible humiliating defeat in regional elections this weekend , launched a fresh attack against the european central bank on friday , saying that high interest rates were central to germany 's economic woes .
" we in germany are effectively making a sacrifice to -lrb- price -rrb- stability , " the ecb 's overriding goal , economics minister wolfgang clement told the german news agency dpa in an interview .
" and that in a period when growth is already insufficient . "
germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , was " in a special situation where prices were exceptionally stable prices , but growth was still insufficient , " clement said .
" in my view that is a reason -lrb- for the ecb -rrb- to look at the situation very closely .
i note that monetary policy in other regions around the world plays a much more active role -lrb- in boosting growth -rrb- than it does in europe and in germany . "
it is not the first time that clement has targeted veiled criticism at the ecb 's current monetary policy stance .
at the end of last month , he said that the ecb had room for maneuver on rates to react to the current economic weakness in germany . dw-world.de bundesbank deaf to calls for ecb rate cut the current level of interest rates in the 12-country euro zone is no impediment to growth in the region , the bundesbank wrote in its may monthly report published on monday , implicitly rejecting recent political calls for lower rates .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury . " " what the study shows is that stem cells can be made that are specific to patients regardless of age or sex and that these cells are identical genetic matches to the donor , " schatten said . dangerous process for reproduction ? the advance came from the same korean researchers who produced the first line of stem cells from a human embryo at 5-10 days , which had been cloned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing dna from a human egg in the new korean research , 11 new lines of embryonic stem cells were created by transferring genetic material from a non-reproductive cell of a patient into a donated egg , or oocyte , from which the nucleus had been removed . the korean researchers said it took an average 17 eggs to make each stem cell line .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury . " " what the study shows is that stem cells can be made that are specific to patients regardless of age or sex and that these cells are identical genetic matches to the donor , " schatten said . dangerous process for reproduction ? the advance came from the same korean researchers who produced the first line of stem cells from a human embryo at 5-10 days , which had been cloned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing dna from a human egg in the new korean research , 11 new lines of embryonic stem cells were created by transferring genetic material from a non-reproductive cell of a patient into a donated egg , or oocyte , from which the nucleus had been removed . the korean researchers said it took an average 17 eggs to make each stem cell line .

financial market regulator bafin said thursday it had found signs that some hedge funds may have colluded in toppling deutsche börse 's chairman earlier this month , and that would oblige them to launch a full takeover bid for the stock market operator .
bafin , which announced last week that it was launching an investigation to find out whether the hedge funds had acted in concert to force chief executive officer werner seifert to quit , said it had found " indications " that a number of funds had colluded to block deutsche börse 's plans to buy the london stock exchange earlier this year .
bafin president jochen sanio told a news conference that the investigation would continue .
if , at the end of the day , it was found that collusion had taken place and if the funds held a combined stake more than 30 percent in the company , they could be obliged under german law to launch a public takeover offer for the remaining shares in deutsche börse .
a number of hedge funds , most notably london-based tci and atticus capital , successfully blocked deutsche börse 's plans to buy the lse and were also instrumental in the departure of swiss-born seifert two weeks ago . dw-world.de deutsche börse meets " locusts " some bankers say an ongoing discussion in germany over capitalism is harming the country 's image .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury . " " what the study shows is that stem cells can be made that are specific to patients regardless of age or sex and that these cells are identical genetic matches to the donor , " schatten said . dangerous process for reproduction ? the advance came from the same korean researchers who produced the first line of stem cells from a human embryo at 5-10 days , which had been cloned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing dna from a human egg in the new korean research , 11 new lines of embryonic stem cells were created by transferring genetic material from a non-reproductive cell of a patient into a donated egg , or oocyte , from which the nucleus had been removed . the korean researchers said it took an average 17 eggs to make each stem cell line .
they cautioned that such cloning for reproductive purposes would be dangerous and should not be attempted . swift change in germany unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder receiving an honorary doctorate from tongji university in shanghai , china in 2002 in germany , schröder is expected to push for therapeutic cloning during a june 14 speech at the university of göttingen , where he will receive an honorary doctorate . but government spokesman bela anda said the chancellor was not going to signal a policy shift during the speech and instead reiterate his belief that a balance had to be struck between chances on the one hand and risks posed by stem cell research on the other . anda added that schröder had already said in march that germany 's current policy should be reviewed in two years ' time to see whether it made sense to stick to current regulations . according to the newspaper report , the chancellor is working with cabinet members to move towards abolishing current limitations on stem cell research .
such a change is unlikely to take place any time soon , however , as the government does not plan to initiate a change in the law before the 2006 general election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial experiments in search of a cure stem cell research remains ethically controversial , but scientists are nonetheless hoping that it might be the solution to diseases of the central nervous system .

but officials are n't worrying - yet . in the coming weeks , the fate of the european constitution will rest in the hands of the netherlands and france , two nations that are at the moment extremely dissatisfied with the way their countries are being run .
that 's not good news for the government politicians who have been alternately coddling and bullying their voters in the past few weeks into approving the document that aims to streamline and simplify the european union , readying it for the challenges ahead . " i do not want to speculate about what will happen if the ' no ' wins , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , in an interview with the daily de volkskrant .
" i am putting my money on the ' yes ' vote .
i am optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende polls suggest that the " yes " camp is trailing in both france and ther netherlands .
in france , which votes on may 29 , 53 percent of those who intend to vote will vote against the treaty .
only 47 percent approve of it .

it 's the first time the scroll goes on display outside israel . " the new hebrews , 100 years of art in israel " was been organized by the israel museum in jerusalem at berlin 's martin gropius bau exhibition hall to mark 40 years of diplomatic ties between israel and what was then west germany . the 3.6-meter-long -lrb- 12-foot-long -rrb- temple scroll , which is being shown outside israel for the first time , is one of the longest biblical texts found since the 1940s .
it is estimated to be about 2,120 years old . bedouins discovered it in 1956 in the judea desert of the qumran region , in caves overlooking the dead sea .
it later disappeared and was recovered by israel 's secret service in 1967 . israel 's mona lisa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cameraman films a work of art by israeli artist michal shamir named " wall-wound " " the dead sea scrolls are a mona lisa for our museum and for israel , " said james snyder , the director of the israel museum , as he presented the exhibition .
" they are one of the ancient seeds for what would become the flowering of modern israel . " snyder added it was appropriate to exhibit the scroll among artworks because of the importance of the discovery of the dead sea scrolls for contemporary israeli culture . 100 years of art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sculpture by israeli artist sigalit landau entitled " the plucker " a total of 700 artworks are on show , retracing in 15 chapters the evolution of israeli culture from the first waves of zionist immigration to palestine to the creation of the state of israel in 1948 and also takes in the intifada and the construction of the security barrier between israel and the palestinian territories . the show includes paintings , photographs , installations , architectural models and videos from over 130 artists .
the oldest works date from 1906 . the holocaust , however , plays a relatively minor role in the exhibition because the subject was for a long time taboo in israel , the exhibition 's curator , doreet levitte harten , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified man photographs two paintings by israeli artist gal weinstein that depict the dead sons uday -lrb- left -rrb- and qusay of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein the " passivity of the victims " was not compatible with the strident image the new state was trying to create and those who had suffered at the hands of the nazis did not want to discuss it , she added . the 1961 trial of top nazi official adolf eichmann was the trigger for israelis to begin discussing their experiences during world war ii , she added . a true miracle attending the official opening with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom thursday night , german interior minster otto schily said the exhibition clearly showed the significance of the holocaust for israel 's creative culture . " it truly is a miracle that we may speak of friendship between germany and israel despite the millions of murdered jews , " he said . the exhibition is open wednesdays through mondays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and runs until sept .

former german international lothar matthäus wants to help the cause of clubs from the former gdr . the fate of teams in eastern germany has become a personal mission of former german international midfielder and current coach of hungary 's national side , lothar matthäus .
matthäus is as bavarian as lederhosen and beer steins , but the desolate situation of professional soccer in the east has aroused his interest .
the only club in the first division , hansa rostock , has been relegated .
none of the four teams in the second league successfully made the jump up .
at one point in the season , all four squads were hovering near the relegation zone but with one game remaining , only erfurt looks to face demotion .
how to stop the movement west in his weekly article with the sport bild magazine , matthäus decided that lokomotive leipzig , once a top team in east german soccer , would receive his help .
due to licensing infractions , lok now rest -lrb- in peace -rrb- in the 11th division of german soccer .
more than 6,000 fans packed the small stadium to watch a player who at one time , according to matthäus , had been booed by the fans .
now he was their hero .
but the marketing gig ca n't take anything way from the catastrophic state of affairs in east german soccer .
young talent are leaving the east clubs in droves to sign more lucrative contracts with western teams .

it 's the first time the scroll goes on display outside israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.05.2005 the year of the locust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insect metaphor is finding plenty of resonance in german media a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .

a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .

the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .

" sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .

" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism .

the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .

" we understand and accept the interests of the other countries , " such as spain , portugal , greece and france , german economy minister wolfgang clement told the news agency dpa in an interview .
but the row should not be allowed to " harm the german clothing sector , " he added . germany was affected only indirectly by the sharp increase in textile imports from china since the beginning of the year , clement said .

china has voiced strong objections to washington 's decision to impose quotas on some of its textile exports , charging that the move will hurt chinese manufacturers .
this week , the european union announced that it would put restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china . but compared with the measures being considered in the us , countries such as france believe that the offensives proposed by eu trade commissioner peter mandelson did not go far enough . the us slapped import quotas on three categories of chinese textile goods last week and added another four on wednesday . that provoked a stiff response from china which said the action undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels . conciliatory gesture from beijing facing the threat of eu limits on chinese textiles imports , beijing made a conciliatory gesture and announced it would raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products from june 1 . the ministry of finance said on its web site that the 74 categories were among 148 products on which tariffs had already been placed at the end of the decades-long global textile export quota system on jan .

virtually all the products affected are exported to the us and eu . the china national textile industry council said the move proved china was a responsible member of the international community .

" this is something that we have to see more precisely from the chinese , " european commission spokewoman francoise le bail said . the issue would be discussed when the chinese negotiator on textiles comes to brussels next week to see mandelson , she added . " we will clarify with the chinese what they intend to do , to have precision on this aspect of things .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury .

protesters have again been gathering in front of the kiev parliament - but this time , they 're calling for swifter change . one of the protestors ' biggest concerns is the current fuel crisis that has led to long lines at the gas stations around the country .
the crisis is largely due to the government ’ s failure to set new crude oil contracts with russia , its main source of oil . late thursday , however , the ukrainian government said it had reached an agreement with russian oil companies to end the crisis . some young ukrainians are hopeful that the eurovision song contest will revive the unifying force spread by the orange revolution , if only for one night .

the venue , the former soviet palace of sports , has been hurriedly renovated , and the contest 's slogan - " awakening " - can be seen on banners and posters all over the city .
it 's symbolic of a new era that began in ukraine in the wake of the " orange revolution " protests last year that ousted former pro-russian prime minister and presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .
however , they 'll be belting out a modified version on saturday night . originally , greenjolly 's song contained the lyrics : " no to falsifications , no to lies .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury . " " what the study shows is that stem cells can be made that are specific to patients regardless of age or sex and that these cells are identical genetic matches to the donor , " schatten said . dangerous process for reproduction ? the advance came from the same korean researchers who produced the first line of stem cells from a human embryo at 5-10 days , which had been cloned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing dna from a human egg in the new korean research , 11 new lines of embryonic stem cells were created by transferring genetic material from a non-reproductive cell of a patient into a donated egg , or oocyte , from which the nucleus had been removed . the korean researchers said it took an average 17 eggs to make each stem cell line .
they cautioned that such cloning for reproductive purposes would be dangerous and should not be attempted . swift change in germany unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder receiving an honorary doctorate from tongji university in shanghai , china in 2002 in germany , schröder is expected to push for therapeutic cloning during a june 14 speech at the university of göttingen , where he will receive an honorary doctorate . but government spokesman bela anda said the chancellor was not going to signal a policy shift during the speech and instead reiterate his belief that a balance had to be struck between chances on the one hand and risks posed by stem cell research on the other . anda added that schröder had already said in march that germany 's current policy should be reviewed in two years ' time to see whether it made sense to stick to current regulations . according to the newspaper report , the chancellor is working with cabinet members to move towards abolishing current limitations on stem cell research .
such a change is unlikely to take place any time soon , however , as the government does not plan to initiate a change in the law before the 2006 general election . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial experiments in search of a cure stem cell research remains ethically controversial , but scientists are nonetheless hoping that it might be the solution to diseases of the central nervous system .

it 's the first time the scroll goes on display outside israel . " the new hebrews , 100 years of art in israel " was been organized by the israel museum in jerusalem at berlin 's martin gropius bau exhibition hall to mark 40 years of diplomatic ties between israel and what was then west germany . the 3.6-meter-long -lrb- 12-foot-long -rrb- temple scroll , which is being shown outside israel for the first time , is one of the longest biblical texts found since the 1940s .
it is estimated to be about 2,120 years old . bedouins discovered it in 1956 in the judea desert of the qumran region , in caves overlooking the dead sea .
it later disappeared and was recovered by israel 's secret service in 1967 . israel 's mona lisa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cameraman films a work of art by israeli artist michal shamir named " wall-wound " " the dead sea scrolls are a mona lisa for our museum and for israel , " said james snyder , the director of the israel museum , as he presented the exhibition .
" they are one of the ancient seeds for what would become the flowering of modern israel . " snyder added it was appropriate to exhibit the scroll among artworks because of the importance of the discovery of the dead sea scrolls for contemporary israeli culture . 100 years of art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sculpture by israeli artist sigalit landau entitled " the plucker " a total of 700 artworks are on show , retracing in 15 chapters the evolution of israeli culture from the first waves of zionist immigration to palestine to the creation of the state of israel in 1948 and also takes in the intifada and the construction of the security barrier between israel and the palestinian territories . the show includes paintings , photographs , installations , architectural models and videos from over 130 artists .
the oldest works date from 1906 . the holocaust , however , plays a relatively minor role in the exhibition because the subject was for a long time taboo in israel , the exhibition 's curator , doreet levitte harten , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified man photographs two paintings by israeli artist gal weinstein that depict the dead sons uday -lrb- left -rrb- and qusay of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein the " passivity of the victims " was not compatible with the strident image the new state was trying to create and those who had suffered at the hands of the nazis did not want to discuss it , she added . the 1961 trial of top nazi official adolf eichmann was the trigger for israelis to begin discussing their experiences during world war ii , she added . a true miracle attending the official opening with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom thursday night , german interior minster otto schily said the exhibition clearly showed the significance of the holocaust for israel 's creative culture . " it truly is a miracle that we may speak of friendship between germany and israel despite the millions of murdered jews , " he said . the exhibition is open wednesdays through mondays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and runs until sept .

former german international lothar matthäus wants to help the cause of clubs from the former gdr . the fate of teams in eastern germany has become a personal mission of former german international midfielder and current coach of hungary 's national side , lothar matthäus .
matthäus is as bavarian as lederhosen and beer steins , but the desolate situation of professional soccer in the east has aroused his interest .
the only club in the first division , hansa rostock , has been relegated .
none of the four teams in the second league successfully made the jump up .
at one point in the season , all four squads were hovering near the relegation zone but with one game remaining , only erfurt looks to face demotion .

"
but can it help revive kiev 's waning revolutionary spirit ? kiev is scrubbed and shining , ready to welcome organizers , performers and fans - as well as an estimated 120 million television viewers - for the annual festival of kitsch that is the eurovision song contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
the venue , the former soviet palace of sports , has been hurriedly renovated , and the contest 's slogan - " awakening " - can be seen on banners and posters all over the city .
it 's symbolic of a new era that began in ukraine in the wake of the " orange revolution " protests last year that ousted former pro-russian prime minister and presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .
however , they 'll be belting out a modified version on saturday night . originally , greenjolly 's song contained the lyrics : " no to falsifications , no to lies .

after the initial euphoria , many citizens have become disenchanted with yushchenko 's government , which has been in power for just over 100 days .
protesters have again been gathering in front of the kiev parliament - but this time , they 're calling for swifter change . one of the protestors ' biggest concerns is the current fuel crisis that has led to long lines at the gas stations around the country .
the crisis is largely due to the government ’ s failure to set new crude oil contracts with russia , its main source of oil . late thursday , however , the ukrainian government said it had reached an agreement with russian oil companies to end the crisis . some young ukrainians are hopeful that the eurovision song contest will revive the unifying force spread by the orange revolution , if only for one night .

"
but can it help revive kiev 's waning revolutionary spirit ? kiev is scrubbed and shining , ready to welcome organizers , performers and fans - as well as an estimated 120 million television viewers - for the annual festival of kitsch that is the eurovision song contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
the venue , the former soviet palace of sports , has been hurriedly renovated , and the contest 's slogan - " awakening " - can be seen on banners and posters all over the city .
it 's symbolic of a new era that began in ukraine in the wake of the " orange revolution " protests last year that ousted former pro-russian prime minister and presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .
however , they 'll be belting out a modified version on saturday night . originally , greenjolly 's song contained the lyrics : " no to falsifications , no to lies .
yushchenko - yes !
yushchenko - yes ! "
the band submitted new lyrics in march after organizers deemed the original version to be " too political . " disenchantment setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko the toned-down version is in keeping , it seems , with the waning revolutionary spirit in ukraine .
after the initial euphoria , many citizens have become disenchanted with yushchenko 's government , which has been in power for just over 100 days .
protesters have again been gathering in front of the kiev parliament - but this time , they 're calling for swifter change . one of the protestors ' biggest concerns is the current fuel crisis that has led to long lines at the gas stations around the country .
the crisis is largely due to the government ’ s failure to set new crude oil contracts with russia , its main source of oil . late thursday , however , the ukrainian government said it had reached an agreement with russian oil companies to end the crisis . some young ukrainians are hopeful that the eurovision song contest will revive the unifying force spread by the orange revolution , if only for one night .
the youth organization pora , which rallied supporters for last year 's protests , has erected 3,000 tents along the banks of the dnieper river for eurovision guests unwilling to pay the inflated room rates at kiev 's hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's entry for the 2004 eurovision song contest , ruslana lyzichko , sings " wild dances . "
" the main idea behind this camp is to recall the revolutionary spirit , " organizer olena gantsyak-kaskiv told reuters . ukraine won last year 's eurovision song contest after entering for only the second time .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .

former german international lothar matthäus wants to help the cause of clubs from the former gdr . the fate of teams in eastern germany has become a personal mission of former german international midfielder and current coach of hungary 's national side , lothar matthäus .
matthäus is as bavarian as lederhosen and beer steins , but the desolate situation of professional soccer in the east has aroused his interest .
the only club in the first division , hansa rostock , has been relegated .
none of the four teams in the second league successfully made the jump up .
at one point in the season , all four squads were hovering near the relegation zone but with one game remaining , only erfurt looks to face demotion .
how to stop the movement west in his weekly article with the sport bild magazine , matthäus decided that lokomotive leipzig , once a top team in east german soccer , would receive his help .
due to licensing infractions , lok now rest -lrb- in peace -rrb- in the 11th division of german soccer .
more than 6,000 fans packed the small stadium to watch a player who at one time , according to matthäus , had been booed by the fans .
now he was their hero .
but the marketing gig ca n't take anything way from the catastrophic state of affairs in east german soccer .
young talent are leaving the east clubs in droves to sign more lucrative contracts with western teams .
for ulf kirsten , former national striker with both the gdr and then reunited germany there is only one solution .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects .

" sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level .

" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism .

the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .

maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 .

maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

protesters have again been gathering in front of the kiev parliament - but this time , they 're calling for swifter change . one of the protestors ' biggest concerns is the current fuel crisis that has led to long lines at the gas stations around the country .
the crisis is largely due to the government ’ s failure to set new crude oil contracts with russia , its main source of oil . late thursday , however , the ukrainian government said it had reached an agreement with russian oil companies to end the crisis . some young ukrainians are hopeful that the eurovision song contest will revive the unifying force spread by the orange revolution , if only for one night .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects .

an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .

the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.05.2005 the year of the locust großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the insect metaphor is finding plenty of resonance in german media a senior politician sparked the current debate on capitalism in germany by comparing foreign investors to a plague of locusts .
but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

but the chancellor wants to expand this and make it easier for scientists to clone for therapeutic purposes , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported on friday , citing government circles . the report coincides with the news that a team of south korean scientists has developed the first lines of patient-specific embryonic stem cells , designed to give a precise dna match . a major scientific advance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed the research marks major strides in work aimed at making it possible one day to transplant healthy cells into humans to replace cells ravaged by illnesses such as parkinson 's and diabetes , said the researchers , whose work was published in the may 20 issue of science . a co-author on the study , dr. gerald schatten of the university of pittsburgh school of medicine called the development " a major advance in the science of using stem cells to repair damage caused by human disease and injury . " " what the study shows is that stem cells can be made that are specific to patients regardless of age or sex and that these cells are identical genetic matches to the donor , " schatten said . dangerous process for reproduction ? the advance came from the same korean researchers who produced the first line of stem cells from a human embryo at 5-10 days , which had been cloned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : removing dna from a human egg in the new korean research , 11 new lines of embryonic stem cells were created by transferring genetic material from a non-reproductive cell of a patient into a donated egg , or oocyte , from which the nucleus had been removed . the korean researchers said it took an average 17 eggs to make each stem cell line .
they cautioned that such cloning for reproductive purposes would be dangerous and should not be attempted . swift change in germany unlikely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder receiving an honorary doctorate from tongji university in shanghai , china in 2002 in germany , schröder is expected to push for therapeutic cloning during a june 14 speech at the university of göttingen , where he will receive an honorary doctorate . but government spokesman bela anda said the chancellor was not going to signal a policy shift during the speech and instead reiterate his belief that a balance had to be struck between chances on the one hand and risks posed by stem cell research on the other . anda added that schröder had already said in march that germany 's current policy should be reviewed in two years ' time to see whether it made sense to stick to current regulations . according to the newspaper report , the chancellor is working with cabinet members to move towards abolishing current limitations on stem cell research .

former german international lothar matthäus wants to help the cause of clubs from the former gdr . the fate of teams in eastern germany has become a personal mission of former german international midfielder and current coach of hungary 's national side , lothar matthäus .
matthäus is as bavarian as lederhosen and beer steins , but the desolate situation of professional soccer in the east has aroused his interest .
the only club in the first division , hansa rostock , has been relegated .
none of the four teams in the second league successfully made the jump up .
at one point in the season , all four squads were hovering near the relegation zone but with one game remaining , only erfurt looks to face demotion .
how to stop the movement west in his weekly article with the sport bild magazine , matthäus decided that lokomotive leipzig , once a top team in east german soccer , would receive his help .
due to licensing infractions , lok now rest -lrb- in peace -rrb- in the 11th division of german soccer .
more than 6,000 fans packed the small stadium to watch a player who at one time , according to matthäus , had been booed by the fans .
now he was their hero .
but the marketing gig ca n't take anything way from the catastrophic state of affairs in east german soccer .
young talent are leaving the east clubs in droves to sign more lucrative contracts with western teams .
for ulf kirsten , former national striker with both the gdr and then reunited germany there is only one solution .
" youth players from east clubs have to be prohibited from transferring , " said kirsten recently .
but convincing german soccer authorities to restrict player movement at a time when globalization has brought africans to ukrainian leagues and brazilians to scandinavian teams , could prove impossible . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's star quality in question bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .

" sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .

the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy .

maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 .

"
but can it help revive kiev 's waning revolutionary spirit ? kiev is scrubbed and shining , ready to welcome organizers , performers and fans - as well as an estimated 120 million television viewers - for the annual festival of kitsch that is the eurovision song contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
the venue , the former soviet palace of sports , has been hurriedly renovated , and the contest 's slogan - " awakening " - can be seen on banners and posters all over the city .
it 's symbolic of a new era that began in ukraine in the wake of the " orange revolution " protests last year that ousted former pro-russian prime minister and presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .
however , they 'll be belting out a modified version on saturday night . originally , greenjolly 's song contained the lyrics : " no to falsifications , no to lies .
yushchenko - yes !
yushchenko - yes ! "
the band submitted new lyrics in march after organizers deemed the original version to be " too political . " disenchantment setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko the toned-down version is in keeping , it seems , with the waning revolutionary spirit in ukraine .
after the initial euphoria , many citizens have become disenchanted with yushchenko 's government , which has been in power for just over 100 days .
protesters have again been gathering in front of the kiev parliament - but this time , they 're calling for swifter change . one of the protestors ' biggest concerns is the current fuel crisis that has led to long lines at the gas stations around the country .
the crisis is largely due to the government ’ s failure to set new crude oil contracts with russia , its main source of oil . late thursday , however , the ukrainian government said it had reached an agreement with russian oil companies to end the crisis . some young ukrainians are hopeful that the eurovision song contest will revive the unifying force spread by the orange revolution , if only for one night .
the youth organization pora , which rallied supporters for last year 's protests , has erected 3,000 tents along the banks of the dnieper river for eurovision guests unwilling to pay the inflated room rates at kiev 's hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's entry for the 2004 eurovision song contest , ruslana lyzichko , sings " wild dances . "
" the main idea behind this camp is to recall the revolutionary spirit , " organizer olena gantsyak-kaskiv told reuters . ukraine won last year 's eurovision song contest after entering for only the second time .

" we understand and accept the interests of the other countries , " such as spain , portugal , greece and france , german economy minister wolfgang clement told the news agency dpa in an interview .
but the row should not be allowed to " harm the german clothing sector , " he added . germany was affected only indirectly by the sharp increase in textile imports from china since the beginning of the year , clement said .

china has voiced strong objections to washington 's decision to impose quotas on some of its textile exports , charging that the move will hurt chinese manufacturers .
this week , the european union announced that it would put restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china . but compared with the measures being considered in the us , countries such as france believe that the offensives proposed by eu trade commissioner peter mandelson did not go far enough . the us slapped import quotas on three categories of chinese textile goods last week and added another four on wednesday . that provoked a stiff response from china which said the action undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels . conciliatory gesture from beijing facing the threat of eu limits on chinese textiles imports , beijing made a conciliatory gesture and announced it would raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products from june 1 . the ministry of finance said on its web site that the 74 categories were among 148 products on which tariffs had already been placed at the end of the decades-long global textile export quota system on jan .
1 . it also announced export tariffs on flax yarn .
virtually all the products affected are exported to the us and eu . the china national textile industry council said the move proved china was a responsible member of the international community . " china 's is a responsible country and it is for the purpose of helping establish a new world textile trade order and ease the trade friction that the government made the concession , " spokesman sun huaibin told xinhua news agency . eu : wait and see bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a security guard stands near clothing on sale at discount prices , at an outdoor market in beijing .
" this is something that we have to see more precisely from the chinese , " european commission spokewoman francoise le bail said . the issue would be discussed when the chinese negotiator on textiles comes to brussels next week to see mandelson , she added . " we will clarify with the chinese what they intend to do , to have precision on this aspect of things .

china has voiced strong objections to washington 's decision to impose quotas on some of its textile exports , charging that the move will hurt chinese manufacturers .
this week , the european union announced that it would put restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china . but compared with the measures being considered in the us , countries such as france believe that the offensives proposed by eu trade commissioner peter mandelson did not go far enough . the us slapped import quotas on three categories of chinese textile goods last week and added another four on wednesday . that provoked a stiff response from china which said the action undercut the very principles of free trade being promoted by washington and brussels . conciliatory gesture from beijing facing the threat of eu limits on chinese textiles imports , beijing made a conciliatory gesture and announced it would raise export tariffs on 74 categories of textile products from june 1 . the ministry of finance said on its web site that the 74 categories were among 148 products on which tariffs had already been placed at the end of the decades-long global textile export quota system on jan .

" we will clarify with the chinese what they intend to do , to have precision on this aspect of things .

pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.05.2005 dutch join french in eu treaty skepticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch prime minister -lrb- c . -rrb- campaigns for the constitution should the eu constitution manage to win approval in france , it faces as big a battle in a netherlands referendum just a few days later .
but officials are n't worrying - yet . in the coming weeks , the fate of the european constitution will rest in the hands of the netherlands and france , two nations that are at the moment extremely dissatisfied with the way their countries are being run .
that 's not good news for the government politicians who have been alternately coddling and bullying their voters in the past few weeks into approving the document that aims to streamline and simplify the european union , readying it for the challenges ahead . " i do not want to speculate about what will happen if the ' no ' wins , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , in an interview with the daily de volkskrant .
" i am putting my money on the ' yes ' vote .
i am optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende polls suggest that the " yes " camp is trailing in both france and ther netherlands .
in france , which votes on may 29 , 53 percent of those who intend to vote will vote against the treaty .
only 47 percent approve of it .
in the netherlands , the numbers are 54 percent against the treaty and only 27 percent in favor of it ahead of the june 1 referendum .
observers say a " no " vote in france would stop the constitution dead in its tracks . referendum on dutch government as in france , where opposition to the treaty has fed off the government 's unpopularity , as well as anxiety over the eu 's expansion to the east and south , the dutch debate has been swayed by fears and concerns unrelated to the text . more than half of dutch " no " camp supporters said they wished to block turkey 's eu bid , while a quarter wanted to defy balkenende 's government .
the dutch referendum is non-binding , but the main political parties have said they will take it into account when the text comes up for parliamentary approval if turnout exceeds 30 percent - even though , according to the prime minister , 85 percent of lawmakers support the constitution . balkenende hit out at the " no " camp for failing to suggest an alternative to the treaty , which aims to simplify decision-making in the 25-member eu , saying : " i have not heard anyone explain what should be renegotiated . " " a no to europe " from france a war of words is erupting in france as well in the final week before the vote .
former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , whose two prior campaign appearances earned high marks , urged his skeptical party faithful late thursday to join the " yes " camp , picking apart the arguments of treaty opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the " yes " vote pull it off in the final week ?
" to those who are tempted to vote no , i say that they have every chance of being deceived , " jospin told 3,000 socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters at a rally in the western city of nantes , warning against a protest vote to punish chirac . " if the french vote no , there will be no change in france , but just a no to europe , " the former prime minister cautioned . pollsters agree that left-leaning voters hold the key to the results on may 29 .
jospin and the ps leadership are campaigning for the constitution , while former prime minister laurent fabius leads the left 's " no " camp .
former communist party leader robert hue hit back at jospin on friday , condemning his " arrogance " and the " constant stream of chatter from the yes camp . " plan b option confuses the " no " camp has gained ground on talk of a possible " plan b " should the treaty be rejected - meaning its eventual renegotiation .
the bva survey showed that 69 percent of french people believe the charter can be rewritten . chirac , along with eu officials and other leaders , has repeatedly ruled out any renegotiation , a message hammered home on thursday during a summit with german chancellor gerhard schroeder and polish president aleksander kwasniewski in eastern france . the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the european union following expansion to the post-communist east , must be ratified by all 25 member states .
so far , seven have done so . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany approves eu constitution german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .

it later disappeared and was recovered by israel 's secret service in 1967 . israel 's mona lisa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cameraman films a work of art by israeli artist michal shamir named " wall-wound " " the dead sea scrolls are a mona lisa for our museum and for israel , " said james snyder , the director of the israel museum , as he presented the exhibition .
" they are one of the ancient seeds for what would become the flowering of modern israel . " snyder added it was appropriate to exhibit the scroll among artworks because of the importance of the discovery of the dead sea scrolls for contemporary israeli culture . 100 years of art bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sculpture by israeli artist sigalit landau entitled " the plucker " a total of 700 artworks are on show , retracing in 15 chapters the evolution of israeli culture from the first waves of zionist immigration to palestine to the creation of the state of israel in 1948 and also takes in the intifada and the construction of the security barrier between israel and the palestinian territories . the show includes paintings , photographs , installations , architectural models and videos from over 130 artists .
the oldest works date from 1906 . the holocaust , however , plays a relatively minor role in the exhibition because the subject was for a long time taboo in israel , the exhibition 's curator , doreet levitte harten , said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified man photographs two paintings by israeli artist gal weinstein that depict the dead sons uday -lrb- left -rrb- and qusay of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein the " passivity of the victims " was not compatible with the strident image the new state was trying to create and those who had suffered at the hands of the nazis did not want to discuss it , she added . the 1961 trial of top nazi official adolf eichmann was the trigger for israelis to begin discussing their experiences during world war ii , she added . a true miracle attending the official opening with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom thursday night , german interior minster otto schily said the exhibition clearly showed the significance of the holocaust for israel 's creative culture . " it truly is a miracle that we may speak of friendship between germany and israel despite the millions of murdered jews , " he said . the exhibition is open wednesdays through mondays from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and runs until sept .

but officials are n't worrying - yet . in the coming weeks , the fate of the european constitution will rest in the hands of the netherlands and france , two nations that are at the moment extremely dissatisfied with the way their countries are being run .
that 's not good news for the government politicians who have been alternately coddling and bullying their voters in the past few weeks into approving the document that aims to streamline and simplify the european union , readying it for the challenges ahead . " i do not want to speculate about what will happen if the ' no ' wins , " said dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , in an interview with the daily de volkskrant .
" i am putting my money on the ' yes ' vote .
i am optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister of netherlands jan peter balkenende polls suggest that the " yes " camp is trailing in both france and ther netherlands .
in france , which votes on may 29 , 53 percent of those who intend to vote will vote against the treaty .
only 47 percent approve of it .
in the netherlands , the numbers are 54 percent against the treaty and only 27 percent in favor of it ahead of the june 1 referendum .
observers say a " no " vote in france would stop the constitution dead in its tracks . referendum on dutch government as in france , where opposition to the treaty has fed off the government 's unpopularity , as well as anxiety over the eu 's expansion to the east and south , the dutch debate has been swayed by fears and concerns unrelated to the text . more than half of dutch " no " camp supporters said they wished to block turkey 's eu bid , while a quarter wanted to defy balkenende 's government .
the dutch referendum is non-binding , but the main political parties have said they will take it into account when the text comes up for parliamentary approval if turnout exceeds 30 percent - even though , according to the prime minister , 85 percent of lawmakers support the constitution . balkenende hit out at the " no " camp for failing to suggest an alternative to the treaty , which aims to simplify decision-making in the 25-member eu , saying : " i have not heard anyone explain what should be renegotiated . " " a no to europe " from france a war of words is erupting in france as well in the final week before the vote .
former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , whose two prior campaign appearances earned high marks , urged his skeptical party faithful late thursday to join the " yes " camp , picking apart the arguments of treaty opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the " yes " vote pull it off in the final week ?
" to those who are tempted to vote no , i say that they have every chance of being deceived , " jospin told 3,000 socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- supporters at a rally in the western city of nantes , warning against a protest vote to punish chirac . " if the french vote no , there will be no change in france , but just a no to europe , " the former prime minister cautioned . pollsters agree that left-leaning voters hold the key to the results on may 29 .
jospin and the ps leadership are campaigning for the constitution , while former prime minister laurent fabius leads the left 's " no " camp .
former communist party leader robert hue hit back at jospin on friday , condemning his " arrogance " and the " constant stream of chatter from the yes camp . " plan b option confuses the " no " camp has gained ground on talk of a possible " plan b " should the treaty be rejected - meaning its eventual renegotiation .
the bva survey showed that 69 percent of french people believe the charter can be rewritten . chirac , along with eu officials and other leaders , has repeatedly ruled out any renegotiation , a message hammered home on thursday during a summit with german chancellor gerhard schroeder and polish president aleksander kwasniewski in eastern france . the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the european union following expansion to the post-communist east , must be ratified by all 25 member states .
so far , seven have done so . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany approves eu constitution german parliamentarians overwhelmingly approved the eu constitution on thursday .
while the treaty has been at the center of impassioned public debate in france , it has failed to ignite similar interest in germany .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france on friday showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .

"
but can it help revive kiev 's waning revolutionary spirit ? kiev is scrubbed and shining , ready to welcome organizers , performers and fans - as well as an estimated 120 million television viewers - for the annual festival of kitsch that is the eurovision song contest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of opposition presidential candidate viktor yushchenko carry a huge sheaf of orange balloons , during mass rally in downtown , kiev , ukraine , thursday , dec .
2 , 2004 .
the venue , the former soviet palace of sports , has been hurriedly renovated , and the contest 's slogan - " awakening " - can be seen on banners and posters all over the city .
it 's symbolic of a new era that began in ukraine in the wake of the " orange revolution " protests last year that ousted former pro-russian prime minister and presidential candidate , viktor yanukovych .
pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko was sworn into office , and has since then made forging closer ties with the european union his main policy objective . heard everywhere during the days of protest last winter was the song " together we are many " by greenjolly , who 've been selected to represent ukraine at eurovision .
however , they 'll be belting out a modified version on saturday night . originally , greenjolly 's song contained the lyrics : " no to falsifications , no to lies .
yushchenko - yes !
yushchenko - yes ! "
the band submitted new lyrics in march after organizers deemed the original version to be " too political . " disenchantment setting in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's president viktor yushchenko the toned-down version is in keeping , it seems , with the waning revolutionary spirit in ukraine .
after the initial euphoria , many citizens have become disenchanted with yushchenko 's government , which has been in power for just over 100 days .
protesters have again been gathering in front of the kiev parliament - but this time , they 're calling for swifter change . one of the protestors ' biggest concerns is the current fuel crisis that has led to long lines at the gas stations around the country .
the crisis is largely due to the government ’ s failure to set new crude oil contracts with russia , its main source of oil . late thursday , however , the ukrainian government said it had reached an agreement with russian oil companies to end the crisis . some young ukrainians are hopeful that the eurovision song contest will revive the unifying force spread by the orange revolution , if only for one night .
the youth organization pora , which rallied supporters for last year 's protests , has erected 3,000 tents along the banks of the dnieper river for eurovision guests unwilling to pay the inflated room rates at kiev 's hotels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's entry for the 2004 eurovision song contest , ruslana lyzichko , sings " wild dances . "
" the main idea behind this camp is to recall the revolutionary spirit , " organizer olena gantsyak-kaskiv told reuters . ukraine won last year 's eurovision song contest after entering for only the second time .
the winning number , " wild dances " by ruslana , mixed ukrainian ethnic rhythms with a raunchy performance by leather-clad dancers . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wild dancers win the eurovision dressed in a skimpy leather costume , the ukrainian contestant in this year 's eurovision song contest screamed and danced herself to the top saturday , exciting europeans with a mix of rock and ethnic music .

former german international lothar matthäus wants to help the cause of clubs from the former gdr . the fate of teams in eastern germany has become a personal mission of former german international midfielder and current coach of hungary 's national side , lothar matthäus .
matthäus is as bavarian as lederhosen and beer steins , but the desolate situation of professional soccer in the east has aroused his interest .
the only club in the first division , hansa rostock , has been relegated .
none of the four teams in the second league successfully made the jump up .
at one point in the season , all four squads were hovering near the relegation zone but with one game remaining , only erfurt looks to face demotion .
how to stop the movement west in his weekly article with the sport bild magazine , matthäus decided that lokomotive leipzig , once a top team in east german soccer , would receive his help .
due to licensing infractions , lok now rest -lrb- in peace -rrb- in the 11th division of german soccer .
more than 6,000 fans packed the small stadium to watch a player who at one time , according to matthäus , had been booed by the fans .
now he was their hero .
but the marketing gig ca n't take anything way from the catastrophic state of affairs in east german soccer .
young talent are leaving the east clubs in droves to sign more lucrative contracts with western teams .
for ulf kirsten , former national striker with both the gdr and then reunited germany there is only one solution .
" youth players from east clubs have to be prohibited from transferring , " said kirsten recently .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .

but some say the use of such populist rhetoric masks a deep-seated aversion to capitalism . the hum started in april , when spd party secretary franz müntefering unleashed a stream of rhetoric likening foreign investors to a swarm of insects . " some financial investors spare no thought for the people whose jobs they destroy , " he told the mass-circulation tabloid bild .
" they remain anonymous , have no face , fall like a plague of locusts over our companies , devour everything , then fly on to the next one . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investors have been likened to a swarm of locusts since then , the droning buzz has grown ever louder : locusts , everywhere .
a giant locust and the union jack flag superimposed on the frankfurt stock exchange in bild .
an insect with a yankee doodle hat and the headline " us companies in germany : bloodsuckers " on a german trade union magazine . müntefering 's " locusts " have got staying power . michael wolffsohn , an expert on german-jewish history at the german armed forces university in munich balked at the metaphor and accused müntefering of drawing on anti-semitic propaganda used by the nazis . " sixty years on , human beings are again compared with animals - a ' plague ' that must be destroyed , " wolffsohn wrote in an article published in the rheinische post . spd officials vehemently denied wolffsohn 's accusations , though müntefering himself has kept mum .
still , many analysts agree that the locust remark has reduced the debate on capitalism in germany to a crude level . " problematic tradition " " i would not go as far as wolffsohn to say that -lrb- müntefering -rrb- deliberately used anti-semitic language , but i would say that there is a problematic tradition in such terms that he should have been aware of , " said historian paul nolte of the international university bremen .
" i was surprised at his lack of sensitivity . " for nolte , lurking behind the populist slogans is the beginning of a larger , long-overdue discussion about what he calls the " c-word " - a sign of germans ' troubled relationship with capitalism . " there is a deficit in understanding among the german public of what kind of economic order we live in , " nolte said .
" it 's worth some serious enquiry about why germans react to the c-word the way they do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a huge poster hangs on a house thursday , october 7 , 1999 , on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the former gdr in the karl-marx-allee avenue in eastern part of berlin where a last gigantic military parade by east german communist leadership occurred ten years ago .
the poster reads : " we were the people . "
nolte pointed to the fact that , in the immediate postwar years , there was a strong antipathy towards capitalism from both the left and right of the political spectrum , the roots of which date back to the 19th century .
it was seen as something foreign , not part of german culture . " in the 1950s and 60s it looked as though we had overcome these reservations , " nolte said .
" with the postwar success narratives of the 1970s and 80s , there was the kind of rhetoric that said germany had finally arrived in the west , had accepted democracy , pluralism , and capitalism - so long as it was classed as a social market economy . " " but it might be that this acceptance of capitalism had not progressed as far in the postwar period as we thought .
until recently , it was part of an illusion we had , sustained by better economic times . " germany 's role in recent years as the sick man of europe , coupled with popular skepticism of the government 's economic reform agenda has finally caused germans ' unease with the capitalist system to bubble to the surface . vote-getting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign posters for the may 22 , 2005 state election in north rhine-westphalia speculation is rife that the capitalism debate has been orchestrated by the spd in order to garner much-needed votes from its core working class members in this weekend 's elections in the key state of north rhine-westphalia . chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats have governed the populous industrial state for 39 years , but according to the polls , a disastrous electoral defeat in nrw is likely .
yet so widespread is the self-doubt created by germany 's economic downturn that not even the opposition parties have been able to counter the spd 's capitalist-bashing rhetoric , nolte said . " the opposition 's position is moving too much in the defensive or saying nothing at all .
maybe the situation will change after the elections on sunday , but even in the rank and file of the conservative parties , there is an uncertainty , a sense that maybe müntefering has a point , and that we are in danger , " said nolte . general election issue ? depending on the outcome of the elections in nrw , foreign analysts are already predicting that schröder will find it difficult to resist carrying on the populist debate on aggressive capitalism , turning it into a platform issue in the run-up to general elections in 2006 . " herr schröder has indulged in anti-american rhetoric before to fight elections , even at the cost of relations with the us , which have never recovered , " read a recent commentary in the british newspaper the times .
" it is hard to see why , short of a recovery in the polls , he will resist the temptation of making ' anti-capitalism ' his motto for next year 's fight . " what could help him resist the temptation , according to nolte , is the fact that schröder is a pragmatist who is pro-business at heart .
the debate so far has had limited capacity to damage germany 's reputation abroad , he said - but warned that this could change were the government to take action to clamp down on the activities of foreign investors . " as long as it stays in the realm it 's in now , the debate is probably not as damaging as some would have us believe , " nolte said .
" but if it were translated into new regulations or restrictions on foreign capital , then of course it really becomes dangerous .

uk-based white nile said trading in its shares would resume on monday .
shares in the firm , which is chaired by former england cricketer phil edmonds , soared in february on news of the deal in oil-rich southern sudan .
white nile 's shares were suspended at the time , pending further details outlining the oil exploration deal .
civil war the company is listed on london 's alternative investment market .
shares in white nile rose 13-fold in less than a week during february - pushing the value of the company from £ 15m to £ 214m - after it secured a deal with the former rebel sudan people 's liberation movement to explore an area close to the border with kenya .
the area was claimed by french oil giant total under an agreement with sudan 's khartoum government in 1980 .
but following a civil war between the mainly arab north and the christian south , the khartoum government no longer controls the land .
under the deal , which was reached with southern sudan 's government-in-waiting just weeks after the end of the civil war , white nile will be given a 60 % stake in a 67,000km exploration area , known as block ba , which may hold as much as six billion barrels of oil .
white nile said it had agreed to issue 155 million new shares and hand over 50 % of the firm to nile petroleum corporation , a company set up by ex-rebels to protect oil interests .
nile petroleum could eventually own up to 70 % of white nile under the terms of the deal .

welsh children 's commissioner peter clarke said complaints and whistleblowing procedures were rarely accessible or promoted .
his report , " children do n't complain and it 's no wonder " , takes its title from one education director 's comment .
his recommendations include a " one-stop shop " in each welsh county .
this is mr clarke 's second report on systems for protecting the rights and welfare of children , and relates only to arrangements in local education authorities . "
the systems themselves are rarely child-friendly or accessible , and are not actively promoted " peter clarke it follows a report three years ago on systems in local councils ' social services departments .
another report , on the clywch inquiry , published in 2004 , included recommendations on complaints and whistleblowing in schools .
his latest review said education authorities ' complaints procedures were likely to discourage children and parents from coming forward .
mr clarke called for a " cultural shift " within education departments to ensure that young people were seen as users of services and rights holders , as well as their parents and carers .
' negative attitude ' he said : " it is hardly surprising that local education authorities receive so few complaints from children and young people given that the systems themselves are rarely child-friendly or accessible , and are not actively promoted . "
the report said education departments should do more to inform children and young people about the services they offer , and to involve them in the process of making decisions .
it said some procedures were " likely to discourage many adults from making a complaint " .
education authorities were also found to have too negative an attitude , and they should use lessons learned to improve services .
the report raised particular concerns about children in specialist teaching facilities far from their families .
it said there would be many safeguards if they were under the care of social services , but there were few within the education system .
it recommended : a one-stop shop offering a contact point for children and young people in each local authority ; councils should review whistleblowing policies , publicise them and train staff to implement them ; local authorities should commission children 's advocacy within education as a priority .

welsh children 's commissioner peter clarke said complaints and whistleblowing procedures were rarely accessible or promoted .
his report , " children do n't complain and it 's no wonder " , takes its title from one education director 's comment .
his recommendations include a " one-stop shop " in each welsh county .
this is mr clarke 's second report on systems for protecting the rights and welfare of children , and relates only to arrangements in local education authorities .
the systems themselves are rarely child-friendly or accessible , and are not actively promoted peter clarke it follows a report three years ago on systems in local councils ' social services departments .
another report , on the clywch inquiry , published in 2004 , included recommendations on complaints and whistleblowing in schools .
his latest review said education authorities ' complaints procedures were likely to discourage children and parents from coming forward .
mr clarke called for a " cultural shift " within education departments to ensure that young people were seen as users of services and rights holders , as well as their parents and carers .
' negative attitude ' he said : " it is hardly surprising that local education authorities receive so few complaints from children and young people given that the systems themselves are rarely child-friendly or accessible , and are not actively promoted . "
mr clarke says young people should take part in decision-making the report said education departments should do more to inform children and young people about the services they offer , and to involve them in the process of making decisions .
it said some procedures were " likely to discourage many adults from making a complaint " .
education authorities were also found to have too negative an attitude , and they should use lessons learned to improve services .
the report raised particular concerns about children in specialist teaching facilities far from their families .
it said there would be many safeguards if they were under the care of social services , but there were few within the education system .
it recommended : a one-stop shop offering a contact point for children and young people in each local authority ; councils should review whistleblowing policies , publicise them and train staff to implement them ; local authorities should commission children 's advocacy within education as a priority .

fox , from bargoed in south wales , finished 16th out of 24 entries in 2004 with his ballad hold on to our love .
he said his successor should enjoy the contest , but the fact that eastern european countries vote for each other would make it hard for her to triumph .
javine hylton , 23 , will sing touch my fire in kiev on saturday night .
fox echoed tv host terry wogan , who has also written off the uk 's chances at the 50th eurovision of adding to its five victories .
the results are not important , as long as you do n't end up with zero james fox " we 've invaded too many countries and nobody likes us , " said wogan .
last year , complaints grew louder than ever that neighbouring countries were doing each other favours .
for instance , greece and cyprus gave each other maximum points , while norway gave sweden 12 points .
norway won only three points in total - but they were all from sweden .
fox , who found stardom after appearing in the bbc tv series fame academy , said javine should try to enjoy the experience as much as he did .
" it was possibly the best seven days of my life , " he said " she is talented , a good performer , and i think the song is great - i think it will go down well in that competition .
but i do n't think she is going to win it for a second . "
javine beat off competition from glamour model jordan to take part he said the important thing was not to let yourself down as a performer .
" the rest of it is out of your hands , " he said .
javine , who will be the second contestant to take the stage on the night , said she was aiming to finish in the top 10 .
a year on from his performance , fox said the sheer magnitude of the event had stunned him .
" it is a big carnival atmosphere and when you arrive and go to the hotel , the world 's press is there , " he said .
" the results are not important , as long as you do n't end up with zero . "
he has not ruled out taking part again .

the newly-merged airline is expected to reduce the size of its 400-strong fleet by about 60 planes .
further cost savings are expected to come from staff reductions , although mr parker said he did not anticipate major redundancies .
the merger is likely to put further pressure on other struggling us carriers such as delta , northwest and united , all of whom have announced cutbacks in recent months .
it is the first big us air industry merger since american airlines took over bankrupt trans world airlines -lrb- twa -rrb- in 2001 .

since november , the crew have gone from helping victims of the tsunami to paying tribute to sailors who lost their lives at gallipoli .
after sailing from plymouth in november to patrol arabian waters , chatham was due to spend new year in dubai .
but when tragedy struck in the indian ocean on boxing day , the crew was diverted to sri lanka .
' very proud ' after the ship 's helicopter crew spotted a village cut off by the wave , sailors helped get vital medical supplies to the village hospital and then helped build a new bridge and reopen the local school .
last month the ship landed sailors to march in remembrance at the 90th anniversary of the gallipoli campaign , playing host to the prince of wales during his time there .
captain steve chick , the commanding officer of hms chatham said : " it has been an extremely busy and varied six months where we have steamed the equivalent of the circumference of the world .
" the change in our tasking from boarding operations to disaster relief efforts and finally to conduct high-profile ceremonial occasions has really shown the range of abilities of the royal navy and i am very proud of the crew and ship for all they have done . "

the 58 woodlands of atlantic oak in meirionnydd are home to more than 1,000 native species of flora .
they were once part of the forest on the atlantic coasts stretching from northern scotland to portugal .
more than 4,000 acres of the woodlands will be looked after in a project aimed at restoring some of the character first created 14,000 years ago .
the woodlands are considered to be some of the best areas of atlantic oak woodland in europe and have been designated as candidate special areas of conservation because they are endangered or vulnerable .
lea hughes , education ranger for the meirionnydd oakwoods habitat management project , said : " if you just take a minute and look around , you 'll just see that there are hundreds and hundreds of different species .
" there are prehistoric plants here .
all these mosses and lichens are basically prototype plants and the first plants to develop after the last ice age .
" we 're really lucky that we have them here to look at today . "
half the money for the four-year habitat scheme is from european objective one funding schemes .
promote environment the rest of the money has been raised by the woodlands ' public and private landowners and the bodies supporting the scheme .
partner organisations include the forestry commission , the countryside council for wales , flintshire woodlands , the woodland trust , ffestiniog railway , the national trust and snowdonia national park authority .
the work , to promote the importance of the woodlands to the local community , their visitors , the economy and the environment , should support the equivalent of 72 full-time jobs .
the project is launched on friday by lord dafydd elis-thomas , the welsh assembly 's presiding officer .

delicacy he said that no more cases had been reported in recent days .
" i hope this epidemic will be the shortest we have known in cuvette west , simply because the local people have taken precautions since the very beginning , " he said .
the outbreak began when villagers went to the forest to hunt elephants and came across the body of a dead chimpanzee , which they took home to eat , before becoming sick , officials say .
the bbc 's christian tsoumou in the congo capital , brazzaville , says that most people in the forest area are hunters and bushmeat is seen as a delicacy .

ebola is highly contagious and is spread through body fluids , such as blood and sweat .
in 2003 , 120 people died from ebola in cuvette west .

only about one in 100 divorces involve a pension-sharing order , where a private or workplace pension is divided between a divorcing couple .
these orders were introduced to better compensate women for lost pension due to time off work bringing up children .
killik warned that many divorced women were facing retirement poverty .
" pensions are still being overlooked in asset-splitting in divorce , " malcolm cuthbert , killik 's director of financial services , said .
" after the matrimonial home , pensions are normally the biggest asset in a divorce settlement . "
mr cuthbert added that women struggled to build up a pension to provide themselves with enough income during retirement .
this was because they were more likely to take career breaks to look after children and tended to earn less than men .

in addition to the trauma of being displaced and suffering the loss of killed relatives , refugees now returning to their shell-shattered communities following the signing of a peace agreement last december face the danger of landmines .
as momodou diame , a returnee in mpack village , close to the border with guinea bissau , explains : " indeed we are grateful that now when we wake up in the morning , we do n't hear the sounds of warring guns .
" but a lot of people here are also worried about landmines that were buried here during the civil war .
because of this we are afraid to venture into the bush to do farm work . "
international agencies working in the region say they have difficulty obtaining the right information , especially from former rebels , on where the landmines are planted .
awareness because of this , handicap international , a charity based in casamance , has started running campaigns to make local people aware of the dangers of landmines and how they can identify where landmines may have been planted .
more than 750 people have been registered as being disabled by landmines since the war began in 1982 .
aid agencies are warning that unless urgent action is taken to start the process of de-mining , many more people are likely to be victims of landmines in casamance .
beginning of the end in the meantime , people disabled by landmines are struggling to get on with their lives .
bakary diedhou , president of the victims of landmines group , said his members have compelling needs that require urgent attention .
he said most victims lack access to specialist medical treatment and women widowed by landmines find it difficult to educate and feed their children .
the rainy season will soon start in casamance and the returnees are worried that they will not be able to access their fields .
aid agencies fear casamancais may face food shortages , despite living in senegal 's most fertile region .
shattered schools aside from landmines , educating the returning children is another challenge facing casamance - a region cut off from the rest of senegal by the gambia .
families coming back from neighbouring countries now face problems rehabilitating their children into the already overstretched school system , which suffered serious neglect in the heat of the conflict .
in addition to bullet-holes on buildings , it is common to see school buildings without roofs .
inside the makeshift classrooms of mpack primary school , pupils use pebbles , bottle tops and cowry shells as counting materials during arithmetic lessons .
every 35 minutes , the school-bell master strikes a disused vehicle wheel-frame hanging on the walls of the administration block to signal the beginning or end of classes .
" as you can see some of our classes are without proper roofs so when the sun is hot , we have to keep moving from one end of the classroom to the other for shade , " says maxine kamoune , the headmaster of mpack primary school .
" the rainy season is just a few weeks away and it will be impossible to keep the children under this condition when it rains . "
memories during the civil conflict , school buildings , hospitals and other community infrastructures were deliberately targeted by the fighting forces .
in addition , almost every family in the war zone has horrific stories and memories of the war , which according to education officials in the region impact negatively , especially on the children .
international aid agencies in casamance are trying to train teachers to help traumatised pupils integrate and cope with everyday life in school .
some of these pupils were either internally displaced or were refugees in neighbouring countries .
but despite the trauma , they know what they want .
during the interactive sessions , one of the pupils sitting at the far end of the classroom shouted : " i want to be a good footballer to help my parents . "
he was wearing the number eight jersey of chelsea 's frank lampard .
although both former mfdc fighters and the government have committed themselves to bringing lasting peace to casamance , the biggest challenge for them is to make good their pledges for positive change in the lives of the ordinary people of the region .

" it is too late when the public is two or three steps ahead of you , and then you are playing catch-up , " he said .
independent film firms were likely to develop the technology to protect new movies , he told cannes film festival .
major studios seemed relatively unconcerned about their movie libraries being shared online , freeman added .
industry ' terrified ' he said major studios seemed more concerned about preventing piracy of new movie releases rather than their back catalogue of films .
yesterday a " work print copy " of the final star wars film , revenge of the sith , was leaked onto an internet file-sharing network just hours after the movie opened in cinemas .
a tracker site showed more than 16,000 people were downloading the film on thursday afternoon .
earlier this year the european film piracy summit in london was told that movie piracy cost the industry $ 7bn -lrb- £ 3.8bn -rrb- in 2003 .
the million dollar baby star , who won the best supporting actor award at this year 's oscars , said digital technology can bring many benefits - such as downloading films onto a pc and playing them in different rooms of the home .
" one of the things that is terrifying the industry about digital content is that once it gets into the home , what happens to it ? "
freeman said .
he said the spread of faster broadband internet connections would make life harder for the movie industry .
while movies require far larger computer files than music , broadband and increasingly popular file-sharing programmes like bittorrent make it increasingly easy to handle the information .
" some government entities say that if it 's on the internet and accessible , then how can we call it piracy ? "
freeman said .

ivan kept a diary of his battle with cancer which appeared in instalments on the news website .
the entries will be published as a book on monday .
the annual bursary is for a recently qualified journalist to work on the science and technology desk .
ivan died in january at the age of 37 after a two-year battle with cancer .
pete clifton , editor of bbc news interactive , said the bursary was an ongoing commitment to help reporters to learn the skills of web journalism .
he said : " when ivan died many readers asked what we would do as a lasting tribute to him .
" we think the bursary is a fitting thing to do - we want to encourage a new journalist with the same passion for science and technology that ivan had . "
the bursary , to be advertised soon , will give a six-month placement to a journalist fresh from college or with less than two years ' experience outside the bbc .
they will research and write news reports and features for the science and technology desk .
ivan 's wife almut welcomed the announcement .
" ivan 's illness was only a very short period of his life and the bursary is there to remember his life before he was ill .
" he was a science and technology writer and this is what the bursary marks .
" i 'm very pleased and honoured that the bbc has chosen to remember his professional life before he was ill . "
support ivan 's tumour diary was a regular feature on the site from september 2002 to the last entry , on 31 january 2005 , the day he died .
it followed his battle through remissions and relapses and provoked thousands of e-mails of support and tribute .
the book of his diary entries , entitled like a hole in the head and published by hodder & stoughton , features some of these tributes .
the book 's title comes from a comment ivan made after being told he needed more brain surgery .
his response : " i need another craniotomy like i need a hole in the head . "
the book also features interviews with people who have lost relatives to brain tumours , as well as doctors trained in breaking the bad news of terminal illness .
the bbc 's proceeds from the book will go to medecins sans frontieres uk , the charity chosen by ivan .
your comments the best thing about a bursary for a young journalist is that it looks towards the future rather than dwelling on the past , which is something ivan never stopped doing , despite his circumstances .
andy , london , england ivan 's web diary was an unusual yet insightful look from someone fighting for his life .
i read his journal since it first came out , and with this book , many will be touched by his battles versus cancer and his eventual freedom from suffering .
this book is a fitting tribute to ivan .
david cruz , philippines my first wife , a brave and beautiful lady died of a painful and intractable colorectal cancer in late 2003 , while we lived in utah usa .
there was no rhyme or reason to her having contracted this dreadful disease .
ivan 's articles have helped me undertsand a little of what my wife went through .
god bless a gentleman and a scholar .
andrew borman , bristol , england i believe a bursary programme such as this is a fitting tribute to any professional in any field .
i only read the final posthumous entry in ivan 's journal after he passed away , but i fully intend to purchase the book at my first opportunity .
i currently hold a degree in multimedia technology and intend to undertake a 2 year hnd in journalism commencing in 2006 with a view to working in much the same capacity as ivan did .
i think he stands as a role model to anyone in my position .
kevin gilmartin , coatbridge , scotland i think it 's a great idea , ivan would approve i 'm sure .
also the book - i 'll certainly be ordering it .
best wishes to almut and his family .
tracy pace , houston , us ivan 's distinct courage and humor were touching and remarkable .
his legacy will long outlast his life .
adil eduljee , new orleans , us how wonderful to remember ivan in this way .
i 'm sure his memory will live on for many years with this .
i was an avid reader of his inspirational diaries and dreaded the day we knew would eventually come .
his children can be proud of this legacy .
i will keep this book as a reference to look at when i feel depressed or fed up over trivial matters .
a read of his diaries will bring anyone with petty problems down to earth with a big bang and put a real perspective on life .
thanks for the memory , ivan and thank you bbc for allowing us to read his original diaries then and now .
k j smith , milton keynes , uk what a wonderful way to honour a brave man who wished to tell the world how he and his family were dealing with his illness whilst still retaining his dignity .
sim haskell-dowland , plymouth uk i think a bursary is a very fitting tribute to a very intelligent and brave person .
i read all the diaries from the beginning and felt very sad when he lost his battle against his tumor .
maureen cooper , guiseley , west yorkshire this is the moment i was waiting for since it was announced that ivan 's diary is going to be published as a book .
i hope it sells well for two reasons : 1.ivan 's courage and approach to life inspite of his terminal illness will be a morale booster to a lot of people with similiar conditions .
2.the proceeds will be of great help to the charity .
k jeevan , kuwait city , kuwait yes , a very good way to honour ivan without overly precious sentimentality .
it looks ahead , investing in the future .
in this way , ivan can pass his baton to future generations of science journalists .
neil , basingstoke i hhink this is a great idea , ivan was a brave man who touched many through his columns with his humour and views .
chris webb , london i read ivan 's diary regularly and enjoyed it immensely .
seeing the courage of people like him reminded me how lucky i am and i was thankful for that grounding i felt .
it helped me put lots of seemingly big issues in my own life back into their small and appropriately insignificant boxes .
his wife is right to say that there is a lot about ivan that the general public do n't know and i think the bursary is a great way to honour all of the wonderful achievements from this brave and sharing man .
paula day , singapore a fitting memorial for such a brave and interesting fellow .
deb , augusta , usa i think the bursary is a wonderful idea .
ivan 's memory will live on .
i read ivan 's diary and during this time was diagnoised with breast cancer .
after surgery , chemo and radiology i returned to work last september and started reading where i 'd left off .
had a few weeks off earlier this year and have only found out today of ivan 's death - oh how i did want him to live and see his family grow .
i feel as if i have lost a friend - god bless him .
myrtle , tyne & wear this bursary is an excellent way to remember ivan .
at a time when there is an uncertain future for science & technology in the uk , encouraging the reporting of these fields is a valuable step .
well done bbc , may ivan 's legacy live long .
ian deaville , solihull uk an excellent , fitting , and worthwhile idea .
to have a bursary as a tribute to someone who inspired others , in spite of such such overwhelming circumstances , would be entirely appropriate .
it will be an honour for anyone benefiting from it and i would think that ivan would be thrilled by the idea of having young journalists encouraged in his particular line of journalism .
i read his diary regularly .
lynda williams , new hampshire , usa i think the idea is just brilliant , it truly reflects ivan 's idea of helping others through his experiences .
and as almut says , it 's great the bbc decided to honour his professional life before he was ill .
this reminds me of ivan 's last column where he said he had not been defeated by cancer .
all his readers know how true this is .
thanks ivan for teaching us so many things , thanks to the bbc for celebrating ivan 's life .
julieta , buenos aires , argentina " a touching reminder that ivan was a successful and competent journalist , not just an ill diarist " jackie hogarty , hampshire i used to read ivan 's diary regularly - it was such an interesting and moving story , and yet full of humour .
the bursary is a touching and practical reminder that ivan was a successful and competent journalist , not just an ill diarist .
jackie hogarty , eversley , hampshire it 's a wonderful idea , one which ivan , i think , would have supported .
ivan 's diaries have helped so many people and it is fitting that even now that he is not with us his presence is still felt in such a valuable way .
yvonne short , usa i looked forward to each and every one of ivan 's diaries .
i knew that if i saw and read his diary that he was still all right .
i felt as if i knew him personally and i was really saddened when he passed away .
i was willing him to get better , to beat it , as probably many , many other people were too .
i feel privileged to have known ivan .
such a brave man .
lisa kartanou , plymouth , uk i read ivan 's diary through the last few months of his life and was amazed by the courage and humour he showed even in his last entries .
i think the bursary is an excellent memorial- it allows someone to pursue their dreams of journalism and contribute in a way the ivan also did , thereby keeping his memory alive .
joanna , calgary , canada a great idea commemorating a truly brave and heroic journalist .
a greater tribute would be for all of us to adopt healthier lifestyles , and for all smokers to quit the habit as soon as possible chris , uk i think this is a great tribute for all of his family .
i read ivan 's diary and was given strength and hope through my mothers own illness .
she too has been paid tribute with memorial gardens on the isle of wight .
the tributes are a mark of respect and establish fond memories of those sadly missed .
well done .
mike k , wales definitely , i read his diaries often and feel that this is a great way to remember and honour his role within the bbc and to all the people who followed his diaries round the world gerard , dublin , ireland " i hope it is enough to allow the journalist to buy all the gadgets just like ivan " paul benwell , cheshire , uk as a man devoted -lrb- perhaps even obsessed -rrb- with the latest gadget and technology , i am quite sure ivan would have approved .
however i hope it is enough to allow the journalist to buy all the gadgets just like ivan seemed to .
paul benwell , cheshire , uk this is a very dignified way to honour an amazingly brave human being .
ivan 's courage and touched millions of people all over the world .
thank you , bbc , for making the effort to keep the memory a remarkable man alive .

the bbc 's proceeds from the book will go to medecins sans frontieres uk , the charity chosen by ivan .

the entries will be published as a book on monday .
the annual bursary is for a recently qualified journalist to work on the science and technology desk .
ivan died in january at the age of 37 after a two-year battle with cancer .
the bbc 's proceeds from the book will go to charity pete clifton , editor of bbc news interactive , said the bursary was an ongoing commitment to help reporters to learn the skills of web journalism .
he said : " when ivan died many readers asked what we would do as a lasting tribute to him .
" we think the bursary is a fitting thing to do - we want to encourage a new journalist with the same passion for science and technology that ivan had . "
the bursary , to be advertised soon , will give a six-month placement to a journalist fresh from college or with less than two years ' experience outside the bbc .
they will research and write news reports and features for the science and technology desk .
ivan 's wife almut welcomed the announcement .
" ivan 's illness was only a very short period of his life and the bursary is there to remember his life before he was ill .
" he was a science and technology writer and this is what the bursary marks .
" i 'm very pleased and honoured that the bbc has chosen to remember his professional life before he was ill . "
support ivan 's tumour diary was a regular feature on the site from september 2002 to the last entry , on 31 january 2005 , the day he died .
it followed his battle through remissions and relapses and provoked thousands of e-mails of support and tribute .
the book of his diary entries , entitled like a hole in the head and published by hodder & stoughton , features some of these tributes .
the book 's title comes from a comment ivan made after being told he needed more brain surgery .
his response : " i need another craniotomy like i need a hole in the head . "
the book also features interviews with people who have lost relatives to brain tumours , as well as doctors trained in breaking the bad news of terminal illness .
the bbc 's proceeds from the book will go to medecins sans frontieres uk , the charity chosen by ivan .
your comments the best thing about a bursary for a young journalist is that it looks towards the future rather than dwelling on the past , which is something ivan never stopped doing , despite his circumstances .
