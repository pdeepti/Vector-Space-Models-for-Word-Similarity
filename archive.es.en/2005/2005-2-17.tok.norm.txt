most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .
in the court hearings , though , singer claimed he was only commissioned to capture gartenschläger alive and bring him back to east germany .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .

with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . -lrb- march 1 , 2003 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .

the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .
a full 65 percent want him to stay on . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame for visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer monday accepted responsibility for a scandal involving the abuse of visas to bring drugs and prostitutes into the country .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .

discussions in german to follow smoking bans in ireland , norway and italy drew a mixed bag of reponses from dw-world readers . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
this law is undemocratic !
is this a part of our new constitution ?
" thou shalt not smoke , or thou shalt be excluded from society . " ?
down with the eu , down with the eu constitution , down with the euro !
long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .
when will the press have the courage to challenge the lies being told from the united nations on down about this issue ? - maryetta ables , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans trying to talk tough on smoking german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright .

7 , 2005 -rrb- a ban on smoking in public ?
ireland has become the first european country to implement a ban on smoking in public , with others soon to follow .
dw-world readers generally support the idea , but a few worry it means an erosion of personal freedoms .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .
a full 65 percent want him to stay on . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame for visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer monday accepted responsibility for a scandal involving the abuse of visas to bring drugs and prostitutes into the country .

the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .

all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .
in the court hearings , though , singer claimed he was only commissioned to capture gartenschläger alive and bring him back to east germany .

many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .

a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said .

the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .
10 - 20 , germany 's capital is rolling out the red carpet for the 55th international berlin film festival .
with 343 films from 52 nations , this year 's festival is bigger than ever .
berlin film festival winner hits theaters " head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .
in the court hearings , though , singer claimed he was only commissioned to capture gartenschläger alive and bring him back to east germany .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .
in the court hearings , though , singer claimed he was only commissioned to capture gartenschläger alive and bring him back to east germany .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 organ-transplant patients infected with rabies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have described the case as " a regrettable one-off " in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor . three people have most likely been infected with rabies in germany following an organ transplant from a woman thought to have contracted the illness before her death .
all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted . " it was a young woman of 26 years who was delivered to the hospital in late december , " he explained .
" months before her death she had been on a trekking tour in india .
later she fell ill in a different region in germany , suffered a heart attack and was admitted here . " five cases in 20 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dogs and cats within the eu must have a passport stating the shots they 've received the fact that the young woman had probably caught the virus while travelling in india was only discovered after three recipients of her organs fell ill in january , showing typical signs of the disease . in some cases , rabies can take several months to appear .
but once it breaks out it is usually fatal .
in developing countries , thousands die of rabies every year , while only five cases have been reported in germany in the past 20 years - one reason why organs are not routinely screened for the rabies virus before being transplanted .
doctors also say it 's impossible to test organ donors for rabies in the short space of time between death and transplantation . " it 's impossible to test for a possible rabies infection , " said thelen .
" it is a terrible tragedy that the organs were infected , but the situation could not have been avoided . " since the young woman had shown no signs of the disease , her organs were extracted and delivered to six patients .
three of them are now reported to be in an extremely critical situation , with two of them in a coma . however , three other patients who also received organs from the infected woman have not shown any symptoms yet and are receiving treatment to prevent an outbreak of the illness . " organ transplants save lives " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who decide to donate organs in germany receive special identification the german organ transplantation foundation , which announced the findings on wednesday , said that it would be the first time the virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany .
but the president of the foundation günter kirsten said there was no need to question the whole practice of organ transplantation : " organ transplantation saves lives , " he said .
" people die while waiting to receive an organ and we know that in this desperate situation many are ready to take a certain risk .
you have to be aware that modern medicine - and of course also transplantation - always carries a risk . " anja von cysewski -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplant laws under microscope facing a growing list of patients in desperate need of an organ transplant , germany 's ethics council met to discuss ways of loosening the country 's strict transplant laws .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted . " it was a young woman of 26 years who was delivered to the hospital in late december , " he explained .
" months before her death she had been on a trekking tour in india .
later she fell ill in a different region in germany , suffered a heart attack and was admitted here . " five cases in 20 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dogs and cats within the eu must have a passport stating the shots they 've received the fact that the young woman had probably caught the virus while travelling in india was only discovered after three recipients of her organs fell ill in january , showing typical signs of the disease . in some cases , rabies can take several months to appear .
but once it breaks out it is usually fatal .
in developing countries , thousands die of rabies every year , while only five cases have been reported in germany in the past 20 years - one reason why organs are not routinely screened for the rabies virus before being transplanted .
doctors also say it 's impossible to test organ donors for rabies in the short space of time between death and transplantation . " it 's impossible to test for a possible rabies infection , " said thelen .
" it is a terrible tragedy that the organs were infected , but the situation could not have been avoided . " since the young woman had shown no signs of the disease , her organs were extracted and delivered to six patients .
three of them are now reported to be in an extremely critical situation , with two of them in a coma . however , three other patients who also received organs from the infected woman have not shown any symptoms yet and are receiving treatment to prevent an outbreak of the illness . " organ transplants save lives " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who decide to donate organs in germany receive special identification the german organ transplantation foundation , which announced the findings on wednesday , said that it would be the first time the virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany .
but the president of the foundation günter kirsten said there was no need to question the whole practice of organ transplantation : " organ transplantation saves lives , " he said .
" people die while waiting to receive an organ and we know that in this desperate situation many are ready to take a certain risk .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .

this law is undemocratic !
is this a part of our new constitution ?
" thou shalt not smoke , or thou shalt be excluded from society . " ?
down with the eu , down with the eu constitution , down with the euro !
long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .
when will the press have the courage to challenge the lies being told from the united nations on down about this issue ? - maryetta ables , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans trying to talk tough on smoking german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .

ireland has become the first european country to implement a ban on smoking in public , with others soon to follow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk .

being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- no way out of the poverty trap a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . -lrb- march 1 , 2003 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .

even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .

" airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .
10 - 20 , germany 's capital is rolling out the red carpet for the 55th international berlin film festival .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

this law is undemocratic !
is this a part of our new constitution ?
" thou shalt not smoke , or thou shalt be excluded from society . " ?
down with the eu , down with the eu constitution , down with the euro !
long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .
a full 65 percent want him to stay on . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame for visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer monday accepted responsibility for a scandal involving the abuse of visas to bring drugs and prostitutes into the country .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .
a full 65 percent want him to stay on . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame for visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer monday accepted responsibility for a scandal involving the abuse of visas to bring drugs and prostitutes into the country .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .
in the court hearings , though , singer claimed he was only commissioned to capture gartenschläger alive and bring him back to east germany .

this law is undemocratic !
is this a part of our new constitution ?
" thou shalt not smoke , or thou shalt be excluded from society . " ?
down with the eu , down with the eu constitution , down with the euro !
long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .
when will the press have the courage to challenge the lies being told from the united nations on down about this issue ? - maryetta ables , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans trying to talk tough on smoking german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright .
-lrb- feb .
7 , 2005 -rrb- a ban on smoking in public ?
ireland has become the first european country to implement a ban on smoking in public , with others soon to follow .
dw-world readers generally support the idea , but a few worry it means an erosion of personal freedoms .
-lrb- feb .
4 , 2004 -rrb- smoking ban begins in italy italy 's 14 million smokers are bracing for a new anti-smoking law which comes into force monday .
it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .

participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.02.2005 where movie money meets euro talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hits , like " traumschiff surprise , " benefited from the efm the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet . while the a-list movie celebrities glide down the red carpet and schmooze at the parties , those who have yet to make it into the upper echelons of the cinematic community are elsewhere at the berlin international film festival . there 's still a lot of flesh to be pressed and smiles to be forced , but the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- event is more than just an exercise in self-promotion .
the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .
a full 65 percent want him to stay on . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame for visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer monday accepted responsibility for a scandal involving the abuse of visas to bring drugs and prostitutes into the country .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .

all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted . " it was a young woman of 26 years who was delivered to the hospital in late december , " he explained .

but once it breaks out it is usually fatal .
in developing countries , thousands die of rabies every year , while only five cases have been reported in germany in the past 20 years - one reason why organs are not routinely screened for the rabies virus before being transplanted .
doctors also say it 's impossible to test organ donors for rabies in the short space of time between death and transplantation . " it 's impossible to test for a possible rabies infection , " said thelen .
" it is a terrible tragedy that the organs were infected , but the situation could not have been avoided . " since the young woman had shown no signs of the disease , her organs were extracted and delivered to six patients .
three of them are now reported to be in an extremely critical situation , with two of them in a coma . however , three other patients who also received organs from the infected woman have not shown any symptoms yet and are receiving treatment to prevent an outbreak of the illness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .
in addition , the civil aviation authority has the power to prosecute the airline and levy a large fine if the carrier fails to comply with the new regulations . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .

" airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?

even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .
in addition , the civil aviation authority has the power to prosecute the airline and levy a large fine if the carrier fails to comply with the new regulations . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 organ-transplant patients infected with rabies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have described the case as " a regrettable one-off " in an unprecedented case , medical authorities in germany say that three people appear to have been infected with rabies after receiving organs from a single female donor . three people have most likely been infected with rabies in germany following an organ transplant from a woman thought to have contracted the illness before her death .
all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted . " it was a young woman of 26 years who was delivered to the hospital in late december , " he explained .
" months before her death she had been on a trekking tour in india .
later she fell ill in a different region in germany , suffered a heart attack and was admitted here . " five cases in 20 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dogs and cats within the eu must have a passport stating the shots they 've received the fact that the young woman had probably caught the virus while travelling in india was only discovered after three recipients of her organs fell ill in january , showing typical signs of the disease . in some cases , rabies can take several months to appear .
but once it breaks out it is usually fatal .
in developing countries , thousands die of rabies every year , while only five cases have been reported in germany in the past 20 years - one reason why organs are not routinely screened for the rabies virus before being transplanted .
doctors also say it 's impossible to test organ donors for rabies in the short space of time between death and transplantation . " it 's impossible to test for a possible rabies infection , " said thelen .
" it is a terrible tragedy that the organs were infected , but the situation could not have been avoided . " since the young woman had shown no signs of the disease , her organs were extracted and delivered to six patients .
three of them are now reported to be in an extremely critical situation , with two of them in a coma . however , three other patients who also received organs from the infected woman have not shown any symptoms yet and are receiving treatment to prevent an outbreak of the illness . " organ transplants save lives " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who decide to donate organs in germany receive special identification the german organ transplantation foundation , which announced the findings on wednesday , said that it would be the first time the virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany .
but the president of the foundation günter kirsten said there was no need to question the whole practice of organ transplantation : " organ transplantation saves lives , " he said .
" people die while waiting to receive an organ and we know that in this desperate situation many are ready to take a certain risk .
you have to be aware that modern medicine - and of course also transplantation - always carries a risk . " anja von cysewski -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transplant laws under microscope facing a growing list of patients in desperate need of an organ transplant , germany 's ethics council met to discuss ways of loosening the country 's strict transplant laws .

this law is undemocratic !
is this a part of our new constitution ?
" thou shalt not smoke , or thou shalt be excluded from society . " ?
down with the eu , down with the eu constitution , down with the euro !
long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .
when will the press have the courage to challenge the lies being told from the united nations on down about this issue ? - maryetta ables , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans trying to talk tough on smoking german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright .
-lrb- feb .
7 , 2005 -rrb- a ban on smoking in public ?
ireland has become the first european country to implement a ban on smoking in public , with others soon to follow .
dw-world readers generally support the idea , but a few worry it means an erosion of personal freedoms .
-lrb- feb .
4 , 2004 -rrb- smoking ban begins in italy italy 's 14 million smokers are bracing for a new anti-smoking law which comes into force monday .
it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices .

all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted . " it was a young woman of 26 years who was delivered to the hospital in late december , " he explained .

but once it breaks out it is usually fatal .
in developing countries , thousands die of rabies every year , while only five cases have been reported in germany in the past 20 years - one reason why organs are not routinely screened for the rabies virus before being transplanted .
doctors also say it 's impossible to test organ donors for rabies in the short space of time between death and transplantation . " it 's impossible to test for a possible rabies infection , " said thelen .
" it is a terrible tragedy that the organs were infected , but the situation could not have been avoided . " since the young woman had shown no signs of the disease , her organs were extracted and delivered to six patients .
three of them are now reported to be in an extremely critical situation , with two of them in a coma . however , three other patients who also received organs from the infected woman have not shown any symptoms yet and are receiving treatment to prevent an outbreak of the illness . " organ transplants save lives " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who decide to donate organs in germany receive special identification the german organ transplantation foundation , which announced the findings on wednesday , said that it would be the first time the virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .

i got that film for peanuts .

last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .

i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .
10 - 20 , germany 's capital is rolling out the red carpet for the 55th international berlin film festival .
with 343 films from 52 nations , this year 's festival is bigger than ever .
berlin film festival winner hits theaters " head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light .
-lrb- march 11 , 2004 -rrb- a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- no way out of the poverty trap a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . -lrb- march 1 , 2003 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings .

the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .

passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .

the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .

" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .

" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- no way out of the poverty trap a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . -lrb- march 1 , 2003 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- no way out of the poverty trap a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . -lrb- march 1 , 2003 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .

the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .

all three are in an extremely critical situation , while three others who also received organs from the same donor are in good health and receiving treatment to prevent the illness . the german organ transplant foundation said that this would be the first time the deadly rabies virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany . a routine case it all looked like a routine case of organ transplantation .
in december , the organs of a deceased donor were delivered from a hospital in the town of mainz to six patients in hospitals all over germany . the donor had died of heart failure without showing any signs of rabies , says manfred thelen , the head of the hospital where the organs were extracted . " it was a young woman of 26 years who was delivered to the hospital in late december , " he explained .
" months before her death she had been on a trekking tour in india .
later she fell ill in a different region in germany , suffered a heart attack and was admitted here . " five cases in 20 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dogs and cats within the eu must have a passport stating the shots they 've received the fact that the young woman had probably caught the virus while travelling in india was only discovered after three recipients of her organs fell ill in january , showing typical signs of the disease . in some cases , rabies can take several months to appear .
but once it breaks out it is usually fatal .
in developing countries , thousands die of rabies every year , while only five cases have been reported in germany in the past 20 years - one reason why organs are not routinely screened for the rabies virus before being transplanted .
doctors also say it 's impossible to test organ donors for rabies in the short space of time between death and transplantation . " it 's impossible to test for a possible rabies infection , " said thelen .
" it is a terrible tragedy that the organs were infected , but the situation could not have been avoided . " since the young woman had shown no signs of the disease , her organs were extracted and delivered to six patients .
three of them are now reported to be in an extremely critical situation , with two of them in a coma . however , three other patients who also received organs from the infected woman have not shown any symptoms yet and are receiving treatment to prevent an outbreak of the illness . " organ transplants save lives " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those who decide to donate organs in germany receive special identification the german organ transplantation foundation , which announced the findings on wednesday , said that it would be the first time the virus had been transmitted via transplantation in germany .
but the president of the foundation günter kirsten said there was no need to question the whole practice of organ transplantation : " organ transplantation saves lives , " he said .
" people die while waiting to receive an organ and we know that in this desperate situation many are ready to take a certain risk .
you have to be aware that modern medicine - and of course also transplantation - always carries a risk .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .

in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .

state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.02.2005 where movie money meets euro talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hits , like " traumschiff surprise , " benefited from the efm the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet . while the a-list movie celebrities glide down the red carpet and schmooze at the parties , those who have yet to make it into the upper echelons of the cinematic community are elsewhere at the berlin international film festival . there 's still a lot of flesh to be pressed and smiles to be forced , but the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- event is more than just an exercise in self-promotion .
the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .
a full 65 percent want him to stay on . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer accepts blame for visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer monday accepted responsibility for a scandal involving the abuse of visas to bring drugs and prostitutes into the country .

17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .

" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .

" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .

even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?

" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .
there are plenty of european clubs that might be interested in snapping up dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .
when will the press have the courage to challenge the lies being told from the united nations on down about this issue ? - maryetta ables , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans trying to talk tough on smoking german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .

the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

this law is undemocratic !
is this a part of our new constitution ?
" thou shalt not smoke , or thou shalt be excluded from society . " ?
down with the eu , down with the eu constitution , down with the euro !
long live freedom , long live happiness ! - joop van dijk , amersfoort , netherlands i live in california , usa , where smoking bans have resulted in a great deal of lost business for bars and restaurants , and lost jobs for people who used to work there - as well as discomfort for many of us who still choose to smoke .
the hordes of non-smokers who were supposed to gratefully patronize the newly-smokeless bars and restaurants failed to materialize .
i 'm more scared of those who would curb my ' vices ' in the name of , than in the possible long-term harm from using tobacco .
prohibition has not worked in the past , it only bred crime .
it is not likely to work now . - terry germany 's hotel and restaurant association 's director ingrid hartges admits that restaurants and bars in germany have been dealing with declining sales in recent years .
many representatives of restaurant and bar associations in the united states were under the same influence of the tobacco industry until government tax receipts proved that smoking bans increased business in many instances .
smoking in german restaurants and bars is so excessive and oppressive that it is the topic of discussion of many returning tourists .
as the rest of europe wakes up to the threat of public smoking habits , more tourists will gravitate to countries that institute total bans and german tourism will continue to decline .
i am a german-american who enjoyed many of the aspects of my mother country .
i have not returned since 2000 , because of repeated serious respiratory infections and asthma attacks brought on by tobacco smoke exposure . - robert starkey , hawaii i absolutely do not support smoking bans in public places , autos , homes , or out of doors .
a business open to the public should be allowed to make the decision that is best for their own business , it should not be mandated by law .
there is no conclusive evidence proving second-hand smoke is harmful , but smoking bans have repeatedly proven to be most harmful .
when will the press have the courage to challenge the lies being told from the united nations on down about this issue ? - maryetta ables , united states compiled by dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans trying to talk tough on smoking german politicians want to talk tough on smoking restrictions in restaurants and bars .
but the smoker-friendly country shows no sign of following other european countries , most recently italy , in banning it outright .
-lrb- feb .
7 , 2005 -rrb- a ban on smoking in public ?
ireland has become the first european country to implement a ban on smoking in public , with others soon to follow .
dw-world readers generally support the idea , but a few worry it means an erosion of personal freedoms .
-lrb- feb .
4 , 2004 -rrb- smoking ban begins in italy italy 's 14 million smokers are bracing for a new anti-smoking law which comes into force monday .
it bans them from smoking in public places including bars , restaurants , discotheques and offices .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .

a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .

germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war . for the past few days , germany 's politicians seem only capable of discussing two things . one : how responsible is foreign minister joschka fischer for a visa policy that let thousands of people into the country illegally ?
and two : when will he appear before a parliamentary committee to face opposition scrutiny ? fischer , who has held the title of germany 's most popular politician for the past few years , is facing a credibility challenge virtually unprecedented in his career .
opposition politicians charge him with looking the other way while german embassies and consulates around the world issued visas to what they say was " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants , including prostitutes and human traffickers .
the affair , whose roots go back to 2000 , but has heated up in recent weeks , has already claimed his deputy and inner-party political rival ludger volmer .
though fischer has accepted full responsibility , the conservative christian democratic union , christian social union and the free democratic party continue to call for his head . has chancellor 's backing they want him to appear before a parliamentary hearing as soon as this week or next week .
on thursday , chancellor gerhard schröder defended his vice-chancellor and said he would n't let him testify before mid-april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor stands firmly behind his foreign minister " i do n't know what the reason for -lrb- an earlier appearance at a parliamentary hearing -rrb- would be , " he told the television station ndr .
" but with the opposition , you never know .
the foreign minister has without question my trust and the trust of the coalition . " he said he would comment on the accusations after the committee has finished its work . government : 1 opposition : 0 the 13-head committee in parliament started work on thursday .
by all accounts , fischer and the coalition government were the day 's winners .
participants told news agencies that evidence presented to the committee showed that the foreign ministry reacted properly to reports of visa misuse in 2001 and 2002 . following complaints to the ministry that it was too strict in dispensing visas in decisions concerning family reunions and sickness , volmer apparently issued a decree that , when in doubt , embassy workers should decide in favor of the applicant . a flood of applicants followed .
in 2001 , the number of visas approved by the embassy in kiev , ukraine alone reached 400,000 .
it was a large number , considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue only 3 million visas each year on average . a political duel in recent weeks , anecdotal evidence of human traffickers and prostitutes that benefited from the lax rules has dominated the german media and mounted pressure on fischer and his responsibility in the affair .
opposition politicians on thursday said the foreign ministry might have even violated rules laid out in the european union 's schengen treaty , which opened up borders among eu states . how dangerous this all is for fischer 's political fate will only be decided after the committee finishes its work .
opposition politicians would love to have fischer cook on the hot seat ahead of elections in the large state of north-rhine westphalia in may .
the government has so far refused to release him to the committee earlier than mid-april , and most observers expect them to hold out longer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you really love me along with the good news from the first day of hearings , the foreign minister can go to sleep tonight assured that he has maintained his title .
polls revealed that only 24 percent of germans think he should resign .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .
15 , 2005 -rrb- german kindergartens fail to impress it 's more bad news for the german education system .
after schools scored poorly on the second pisa study , a separate report on germany 's kindergartens found that early childhood education ranks low on the priority list .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2004 -rrb- no way out of the poverty trap a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . -lrb- march 1 , 2003 -rrb- " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .

according to its statement , the company booked net profit of € 50 million -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- in 2004 , down from € 126 million a year earlier .

in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .

in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .

state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2005 church warns against alternative burials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann wants to see death done the traditional way as the biannual three-day german bishops ' conference draws to a close in cloppenburg , its 69 members have come out in force against new german burial trends . " grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .
in addition , the civil aviation authority has the power to prosecute the airline and levy a large fine if the carrier fails to comply with the new regulations . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .
10 - 20 , germany 's capital is rolling out the red carpet for the 55th international berlin film festival .

according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .

if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .
in addition , the civil aviation authority has the power to prosecute the airline and levy a large fine if the carrier fails to comply with the new regulations . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .
in addition , the civil aviation authority has the power to prosecute the airline and levy a large fine if the carrier fails to comply with the new regulations . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu favors aviation tax to fund african aid a proposal put forward by germany and france to tax commercial aviation fuel to raise funds for development in africa was endorsed by the european union executive on tuesday .

" grieving and remembering requires rituals and concrete places , " said conference president , cardinal karl lehmann .
" foregoing structured mourning and remembering of the dead makes it harder to come to terms with the loss . " " green funerals " his concerns refer to the increasing changes to burial traditions that have taken place across germany in recent years , and specifically the trend towards anonymous burial - burying urns containing ashes in unmarked parts of cemeteries without headstones - as well as " green burial , " the increasingly popular new-age way of laying the dead to rest often described as a more ecological choice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these alternative ways of dealing with the dead also include scattering ashes in what are known as " peaceful forests . " according to the church , the practice is a throwback to a pagan , pre-christian age - and therefore firmly frowned upon . burial on the cheap to many , rising funeral costs also make it a cheaper choice - a more financially viable option given the escalating expense of coffins , gravestones and cemetery plots , which can add up to some € 5,000 -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreover , the plots are in such short supply in germany that they 're re-used once the ' lease ' has run out .
families rent the plot for a period of up to 25 years , and when the time period is over , they 'll be approached by the local church or civil authorities about a rental renewal .
if there is no next of kin , they ca n't be found or they choose not to renew the rental , the plot is reallocated and re-used . cemeteries have begun to complain of falling profits now that fewer families are buying plots , paying for their upkeep or renewing the leases .
they 've also noted a rise in low-cost cremations and burials in neighboring countries such as poland and the czech republic - where a burial costs just € 900 . bringing communities back into the fold cardinal karl lehmann said the church should step up efforts among urban communities in particular , where , he stressed , " people have a shocking relationship to their dead and simply want to dispose of them . " these efforts are expected to include allowing priests to perform burials in non-ecclesiastical robes , in the hope that even people who consider themselves non-religious will decide to have christian burials . the bishops also discussed the need for the catholic church to allow muslims to be buried in its cemeteries . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ashes to ashes while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .

the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.02.2005 where movie money meets euro talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hits , like " traumschiff surprise , " benefited from the efm the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet . while the a-list movie celebrities glide down the red carpet and schmooze at the parties , those who have yet to make it into the upper echelons of the cinematic community are elsewhere at the berlin international film festival . there 's still a lot of flesh to be pressed and smiles to be forced , but the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- event is more than just an exercise in self-promotion .
the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .
10 - 20 , germany 's capital is rolling out the red carpet for the 55th international berlin film festival .
with 343 films from 52 nations , this year 's festival is bigger than ever .
berlin film festival winner hits theaters " head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light .
-lrb- march 11 , 2004 -rrb- a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.02.2005 new eu passenger rights anger airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules could make such situations a bit more bearable new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines . whether you 're traveling on business or jetting off on holiday , long delays and cancelled flights can be expensive and annoying .
even more aggravating ?
being told you ca n't board your flight because it 's been overbooked . the european commission has decided that passengers are getting a raw deal and has replaced outdated legislation on passenger rights with a new law , which takes effect on feb .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition to doubling the compensation limit paid to passengers who are bumped from an overbooked flight , the law will compensate passengers in the event of cancelled flights , which were n't covered under the old legislation .
passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .
" also , we feel there have to be some basic rules .
they should n't go into too much detail as the airline has to be left room for its own policy , but there should be some parameters , because passengers were really the weaker element in this story . " airline objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines will have to pay up if take off is delayed by several hours the new laws have angered airline associations .
the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- said that among the problems it has with the " flawed " regulations is that carriers may be held responsible for circumstances beyond their control , such as bad weather , or an air traffic control strike .
and this will ultimately lead to less convenient service for passengers , said tony concil , press spokesman for iata . " airlines have been trying to keep connection times to a minimum to make travel as convenient as possible , " he said .
" if they now risk getting severely penalized whenever they miss a connection , then the natural inclination will be to increase connection times so as to reduce that risk . " the eu said this wo n't be the case , as airlines will not be held responsible if they can show that there were extraordinary circumstances that led to a cancellation or delay .
" but the burden of proof is on them , " de rynck said . low-cost carriers are particularly concerned about the effect the new regulations could have on their industry , as the across-the-board compensation levels could see budget airlines paying out amounts that far exceed ticket prices . " the fixed sum payable as compensation in the case of cancelled flights is disproportionate to the level of the low fares paid by consumers , " said wolfgang kurth , president of the european low fares airline association -lrb- elfaa -rrb- and ceo of german budget carrier hapag-lloyd express . legal challenge the elfaa and iata are among the organizations that have filed legal challenges against the new eu regulations , though the european court of justice wo n't hear the cases until september or october of this year .
the airlines say that could be too late for carriers which are already operating close to bankruptcy and could be forced out of business by large compensation bills . the eu commission , though , fails to see how that could happen .
" cancellations do happen , but it 's not a regular practice , at least it ca n't be a regular practice if the airlines care about providing good , reliable service , " de rynck said .
" and if they were to reduce the practice of overbooking , how would this introduce extra costs for them ?
so no , i do n't buy that argument . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low cost carriers fear they 'll suffer most from the new regulations he added that he does n't think low-cost airlines should be granted either an exemption from the regulations or a different set of regulations that reflect their lower ticket prices . " let 's not forget that we introduced a single , liberalized airspace in europe which allowed low-cost airlines to emerge , " de rynck said .
" now it 's only fair that they take sufficient regard of passenger rights . " knowing your rights passengers should be aware , though , that the onus is on them to claim the compensation they 're due if their flight is delayed , cancelled , or overbooked , because the airlines are unlikely to offer compensation to those who do n't ask for it . each eu member state has an enforcement body to ensure disputes between passengers and airlines are settled quickly .

passengers can demand compensation ranging from € 250 to € 600 -lrb- $ 325 - $ 778 -rrb- , depending on the length of the flight .
in the case of delays - also not covered by the previous law - passengers are now entitled to a ticket refund if the delay is five hours or more .
in addition , airlines may , under certain circumstances , have to foot the bill for passenger meals and accommodation . eu commission spokesman for transport , stefaan de rynck , said the new regulations are aimed at discouraging airlines from overbooking .
on average , airlines overbook by 20 percent , claiming that 's the number of people who do n't show up for their flight . " we feel that increasing compensation will dissuade airlines from overbooking , " de rynck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.02.2005 where movie money meets euro talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german hits , like " traumschiff surprise , " benefited from the efm the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet . while the a-list movie celebrities glide down the red carpet and schmooze at the parties , those who have yet to make it into the upper echelons of the cinematic community are elsewhere at the berlin international film festival . there 's still a lot of flesh to be pressed and smiles to be forced , but the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- event is more than just an exercise in self-promotion .
the efm is one of the most important events on the industry calendar and one where the hard work can make or break a film . held at daimlerchrysler 's prestigious quarters on berlin 's potsdamer platz , the efm is hardly a consolation prize for those attending .
through its connection with the berlinale , one of the world 's biggest film festivals , the european film market brings the raw material of the industry - the movies themselves - into direct contact with the movers and shakers who can secure promotion and international distribution rights . berlinale means business the erm , with its network of 25 cinemas showing the latest in film across the german capital during the festival , has benefited from the competing american film market -lrb- afm -rrb- moving its schedule from the beginning of the year to november .
now an increasing number of accredited industry professionals can show their growing interest in the berlinale 's driving force - business . film buyers and sellers from around the world have poured into berlin in unprecedented numbers for the 55th berlinale , including us power players paramount , miramax and focus .
with many of the films in the festival 's competition already licensed in some territories , the buying focus is directed towards the european film market and its spill-over in other sections of the festival . 2004 a record year for german film bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " head-on " german cinema is currently booming with films like fatih akin ’ s recent " head-on , " breaking all records .
with an admissions rise of 5.2 percent in 2004 and a 24 percent share of the local market , the german film industry experienced its best year in a decade . thanks to the success of such local films as " traumschiff surprise , " " seven dwarfs " and the oscar-nominated " the downfall , " the local industry has attracted 36.7 million cinema-goers , leading to a record market share .
" all you need is a success story … in any business .
you have one success-story then it opens the doors , " european film market director beki probst explained to dw-radio . success brings further rewards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the downfall " traders are paying particular attention to new german actors , young directors and their films .
the diversity in style and content has never been bigger .
berlinale co-director alfred holighaus pointed out that the many awards picked up by german films over the year prove that there 's a new aesthetic standard in german cinema . " things are really changing , " holighaus said .
" not just that there are more german films which are seen by more german audiences , which is good news .
but on the other hand , german films start to travel and start to sell all over the world . " a world premiere at the berlinale can result in million-dollar distribution deals .
and german production companies and media funds jump at financing follow-ups .
what 's more , their importance on the huge us film market has grown as hollywood faces increasing financial difficulties .
german media funds alone invested € 12.3 billion -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- in films last year , of which a total of 80 percent went to us productions . efm director probst was careful not to speak about the exact trade volume on her floor at potsdamer platz .
" in business , secrecy is a very , very big factor .
everything is dealt in hotel rooms , bars or whatever and no one will come to you and say : ' you know what ?
i got that film for peanuts .
i only paid one million dollars ' . " public funding a necessity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although business has picked up , not one german production could have been shot without public funding .
last year € 242 million went into new productions .
and the same applies to the 750 theatrical features that were produced in europe . at the moment , the eu ’ s media program eurimages has committed € 643 million over seven years for distributors across 25 countries .
spread over 750 films , that sum is too small .
according to experts , eurimages and the national agencies should pool their resources . meanwhile , germany is edging closer to introducing its own version of the uk 's sale-and-lease back system , according to german culture secretary christina weiss .
the government plans to make film funding fully tax-deductible under the condition that 35 percent of total production costs are spent within the country . the investment system is meant to benefit the german film industry directly .
but critics are saying the government 's plans would lead to an inflation of budgets , as countless lawyers , accountants and other professionals demand sizeable fees without really helping the industry . new fund to provide more opportunities bildunterschrift : possibly a better idea is the berlinale 's new world cinema fund aimed at supporting film makers in developing countries .
as announced at the festival , the wcf has received a 20 percent boost in funding thanks to a € 383,700 injection from germany 's goethe institute . one of the first productions with wcf support has already received great acclaim at the berlinale .
" paradise now " is a drama about the last 24 hours in the lives of two palestinian suicide bombers made by palestinian director hany abu-assad on the west bank . the film breaks taboos and does not provide easy answers where life is complicated under israeli occupation .
days after the middle east summit in egypt , the israeli film fund has committed itself to supporting the film at home .
" it 's going to be difficult to find a distributor in israel that will pick it up , " lamented katriel schory , head of the public agency .
" we may have to do it ourselves . " peter zimmermann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2005 from feb .
10 - 20 , germany 's capital is rolling out the red carpet for the 55th international berlin film festival .
with 343 films from 52 nations , this year 's festival is bigger than ever .
berlin film festival winner hits theaters " head-on , " the much talked-about german film which won the berlin film festival 's highest award , opens in theaters in germany on thursday .
the movie gained notoriety when its female star 's porn past came to light .
-lrb- march 11 , 2004 -rrb- a bumper year for german film after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.02.2005 making germany child-friendlier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan foresees children being a natural part of society the cabinet has approved a plan to make germany one of europe 's most child-friendly countries by 2010 .
key aspects include education , healthcare and prevention of violence . just weeks after a study conducted by the institute for social work and education in frankfurt revealed that one in five children live in poverty in germany , minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- has unveiled a scheme designed to make the nation child-friendlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " children are our social legacy , " she said in berlin wednesday .
" they need the best conditions possible as they grow up . "
time for a mentality shift that 's where the " national plan of action for a child-friendly germany " comes in .
schmidt pointed out that germany rates conspicuously poorly on the european scale of child-friendliness .
while her new agenda , drawn-up in response to the un world summit for children in 2002 , might not include what she described as " spectacular innovations , " she said she hoped it would bring about a shift in the prevailing mentality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while schmidt has already announced funding for aspects of the scheme such as improving children 's eating habits and stressing the importance of physical exercise , her main priority is simply to make germany look more favorably upon the young generation .
" society has to start thinking that having children is a normal and a smart move , " announced schmidt .
not used to children according to the minister germany is n't necessarily anti-children , it 's just not used to them .
while the average number of children per family in france and ireland is two , it 's just 1.3 in germany .
" germany has become a country that 's forgotten what children are like , " she stressed .
" children are no longer taken for granted as part of our lives .
and no wonder , when only the minority of households includes children under 18 . "
a six-point plan the mainstay of the six-point scheme is education .
as schmidt pointed out - and as the last program for international assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- study proved - social background largely determines educational opportunities and therefore employment chances in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we ca n't afford to let this happen any more , " schmidt said . her strategy includes improving pre-school care , with , for example , better training for kindergarten staff , and providing whole-day schooling across the country . the underlying principle is that better child-care allows parents to combine family and career responsibilities .
another top priority is taking measures to protect juveniles from violence .
" nothing is more horrifying than violence towards children , " said schmidt .
schmidt also plans to initiate consciousness-raising campaigns against alcohol and tobacco and promoting healthy diets .
" the fact that one third of 15-year-olds regularly drink and smoke is a worrying statistic , " she said .
further issues that need to be addressed included the widespread use of computer games , the popularity of fast food and the tendency to watch television rather than practice sport - resulting in obesity among one fifth of germany 's children .
crucial to the campaign , said schmidt , is making sure that children are actively involved in policy-making .
a web site has been set up by the ministry for family affairs specifically for this purpose , and provides young people between the ages of 8-12 with information about children 's rights and political associations .
" we need to make germany a country where children 's noise is n't considered more of a disturbance than traffic noise , " schmidt said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : fear in the schoolyard schools in germany are grappling with a rise in violence ranging from verbal abuse and bullying to physical injury .
teachers ' and police unions have now unveiled a new initiative to tackle the problem . -lrb- feb .

courts in reunified germany have prosecuted several hundred border guards and officials from the former east german politburo for ordering or carrying out ruthless killings at the frontier line .
most of the border guards were given short or suspended sentences , because they were found to have acted under standing orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , who heads germany ’ s agency responsible for processing archived material from the former stasi secret service , said she regreted the dwindling interest among germans about the former border killings . " on the one hand , you clearly have to realize that events and crimes surrounding former east germany , in particular the heinous activities of the stasi , no longer arouse the interest of the majority of the german population , " birthler said . " on the other hand … a lot has been achieved in the past 15 years in trying to bring to justice those responsible for the killings .
most other nations with a dictatorship behind them have taken much longer to come to terms with their recent history , ” she said . unspectacular ending this week ’ s final trial came to an unspectacular end , with a former senior stasi officer found not guilty on all charges brought against him . he stood accused at the leipzig court of justice of having killed 32-year-old michael gartenschläger in may , 1976 .
the judges said they could not rule out that the stasi officer acted in self-defense as mr. gartenschläger was armed when the two met on the border line .
as a young man of 17 , gartenschläger was handed a life sentence by a regional court for protesting against the berlin wall .
he spent ten years behind bars before being ransomed by west germany , and he crossed to the other side of the wall in 1971 .
from the west , he helped other dissidents leave the communist east . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive in berlin but what really infuriated the stasi at the time were gartenschläger ’ s activities to get hold of and document the pressure-sensitive self-firing weapons which east germany installed along the border and which at the time it denied it had . he was caught in an ambush at the border while trying to dismantle one of those shrapnel weapons and shot by stasi officer singer .
in the court hearings , though , singer claimed he was only commissioned to capture gartenschläger alive and bring him back to east germany .

the state of north rhine-westphalia rejected suggestions it bail out the bundesliga team . borussia dortmund , which runs its business year from july to june , said it had run up a preliminary operating loss of € 27.2 million -lrb- $ 35 million -rrb- in the six months to december .
and that figure was expected to widen to € 68.8 million for the full year ending june 30 , 2005 . " the earnings and financial situation of borussia dortmund has become existence-threatening , " the ailing club said in a statement . together with cumulative losses of € 73.3 million from previous years , that meant that bundesliga champion of 2002 had a total shortfall of € 142.1 million , equivalent to 79 percent of its paid-up capital .
in view of its " very tight finances , " borussia dortmund 's management was in " constant and constructive dialogue with creditors about how to overcome the current bottleneck on a sustainable basis , " the statement said . it had therefore asked auditors rölfs partner to draw up a restructuring concept .
as part of the package , borussia dortmund intended to defer rental payments to the westfalenstadion stadium where it plays its matches , as well as a series of other measures . bildunterschrift : while the majority of creditors had already agreed to the restructuring , three creditors had not yet given their approval and the soccer club was continuing to negotiate with them , borussia dortmund said .
the financial troubles come only a week after gerd niebaum resigned as club president .
his replacement , hans-joachim watzke , was named two days ago . borussia dortmund shares fell heavily on the stock exchange in the wake of the news and were showing a loss of € 0.49 or 18.49 percent at € 2.16 in late morning trade . the german state north rhine-westphalia said it would not step in to bail out the once-mighty ruhr valley club .
state sport minister michael vesper said it would be a huge blow if the team disappeared from the bundesliga , but there was no way to justify helping borussia pay for its expensive players .
" we can not use public funds to secure the millions in salaries for pros , " state sport minister michael vesper told the dpa news agency . in an effort to solve its financial woes , it seems the 2002 bundesliga champion may be forced to cash in its best assets .
there are plenty of european clubs that might be interested in snapping up dortmund 's czech stars tomas rosicky and jan koller . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

lessons at the prestigious athenaeum pontificium regina apostolorum will include the history of satanism and its context in the bible .
practical lessons in psychology and the law will also feature .
concern is high in italy about the influence of satanic cults - especially among the young and impressionable .
and there will also be seminars at the athenaeum , or upra as it is known , on the spiritual , liturgical and pastoral work involved in being an exorcist .
the ideal exorcist father giulio savoldi has been milan 's official exorcist for more than 20 years .
he did not have the benefit of training but is in no doubt about what he would include in any course for candidates to take on the task of fighting evil in the raw - and the qualities needed of any would-be exorcist .
" i would include the supernatural force - the presence of god - and then suggest that the man picked to do this kind of work be wise and that he should know how to gather strength not just from within himself but from god , " he says .
" because each case of possession is different , each person possessed is different .
those studying to become exorcists should also study psychology and know how to distinguish between a mental illness and a possession .
" and - finally - they need to be very patient . "
next week - in a case that has captured the public imagination - a court outside milan is due to consider murder charges against a group of young people accused of killing two teenagers as part of a satanic rite .
for father savoldi , the case just confirms his belief in the power of evil to make the most of human weakness .

a university of glamorgan study found more than half the hard drives they saw still contained sensitive information .
it is feared some of the information could be used by criminals .
the information commissioner 's office , which monitors data disposal , has said it will be tough on any organisations breaching the data protection act .
the study examined 105 hard drives which had been purchased on internet auction sites and was able to access 92 of them .
they ca n't just take hard disks and throw them in the bin and say we have disposed of them dr andrew blyth the data recovered by the university team included staff passwords and national insurance numbers , a template to print a university degree and even detailed information about school children .
researchers found 57 % of the readable disks contained data which allowed the original owners - ranging from organisations in the leisure and financial services industries to a number of universities - to be identified .
a fifth of the disks contained financial information , including sales receipts and profit and loss reports .
and disks from home users or small firms had family information , vat numbers and internal organisation data on them .
dr andrew blyth , principal lecturer at the university 's school of computing , said companies needed to have a " cradle-to-grave " approach to computer security .

a day in the life of an easyjet plane - with breakfast 's mike sergeant european rules which could give passengers hundreds of pounds ' compensation for delayed or cancelled flights are being criticised by budget airlines many airlines such as easyjet and ryanair offer some tickets for well under £ 50 .
but , under the new rules , they may have to pay out as much as £ 170 , for over-booked or cancelled flights .
this morning , breakfast looks at the new compensation package and asks whether it spells the end of cheap flights our reporter mike sergeant brought you a day in the life of an easyjet plane , as it criss-crosses europe , from london , to edinburgh and amsterdam .
compensation rules the new rules offer various levels of compensation , if flights are delayed or cancelled .
small delays probably wo n't mean any compensation at all .
if an airline bumps a passenger off a shorthaul flight because of over-booking , it will have to pay £ 170 - regardless of what the passenger paid for the ticket .
compensation for cancellation flights less than 935 miles : £ 170 flights 935-2,215 miles : £ 272 flights over 2,215 miles : £ 415 long-haul passengers could get up to £ 415 per person if their flight is cancelled .
delays the new rules will also mean that delayed passengers could be entitled to free meals , phone calls and even overnight hotel accommodation .
you should get some form of recompense if your flight is delayed by up to two hours -lrb- for short-haul flights -rrb- ; three hours for medium range flights or four hours for long-haul flights .
if your flight is delayed by more than five hours , you 're entitled to a refund of your ticket .

sdlp councillor michael carr became suspicious after the device was posted to his home in warrenpoint .
" i am very annoyed and angry - there are children in this house who could have opened the package , " he said .
mr carr said he believed it was sent by the real ira .
he said the dissident republicans have threatened him before , sending bullets inside sympathy cards .
he added : " the actions that were required to deal with the package inconvenienced my neighbours , some of whom are quite elderly . "
a number of sdlp members of district policing partnerships have been the target of intimidation .
district policing partnerships were set up across northern ireland under reforms initiated by a commission headed by former hong kong governor chris patten and implemented by the government .

since november , thousands have joined the world community grid -lrb- wcg -rrb- which uses idle computer time to help solve serious health and social problems .
over 4,000 " teams " have been running a simple program which processes proteins for the institute of systems biology .
the seattle-based institute is working out the role of proteins in bodies .
the calculations completed so far by the thousands of ordinary desktop computers mean that the wcg has done 22 % of the total analysis needed for the institute 's human proteome folding project .
" it makes me feel great because it is easy to sit back and let it run , " graham hood , a community administrator for the 63-member my online team , told the bbc news website .
" i ca n't think of a better way to put spare time into good use , " added the watchmaker based in birmingham .
by the time the project ends it is predicted that more than 20,000 years of computing will have been done .
technical trouble-shooter as well as being a keen " protein cruncher " , mr hood has also filled the role of technical trouble-shooter for those in the wcg community who fear viruses - not the biological kind .
participants only need to know how to install the software - no other expertise is required to be part of the effort .
but that means some who take part may not necessarily be so savvy about technology and computer security either , which could cause problems .
the software required to take part in the wcg is small , simple , and does its calculations without users realising it .
if you took 10,000 people and said it is costing you this amount a week to run your computer , would you prepared to donate that money to charity or put this program on the computer and it costs you nothing ?
graham hood , my online team small , encrypted files of protein data are automatically downloaded via a secure server when users connect to the net .
with the current concern over spyware and viruses , wcg members have needed to ensure they remain secure online , but configure their systems to let the right kind of encrypted data in and out .
spyware are programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers to gather information about users .
they can slow computer processors and clog systems .
" if you have a pc at home , it is more simple , " said mr hood .
" but if you are in corporation and you want to put 40 computers on the grid , due to the fact that networks have to be so secure , firewalls will block information getting back to the grid .
" people have to get past the firewall in a safe manner . "
on the community 's forums , advice is given out readily .
the project is also a way of contributing to a good cause that avoids scam " charity e-mail " phishing attempts - e-mails which pretend to be from legitimate charities .
this kind of scam recently hit tsunami relief fund-raising efforts .
" if you took 10,000 people and said it is costing you this amount a week to run your computer , would you prepared to donate that money to charity or put this program on the computer and it costs you nothing ? "
of course , a resource like cash is always a welcome relief for charities too , but at least computers which get more powerful year on year can do something useful , too .
premier processing league the teams and individuals also earn points for the processing and calculations each has done .
those with the most points , worked out and balanced against the specification of the computer and net connections speeds , are ranked in a league .
the " premiership " tends to comprise those who might have more than one processor linked up to the wcg .
" one person from hollywood has a render farm with 30 processors in it .
so he is doing in one day what i have done in three months , " explained mr hood .
the first wcg project is trying to unveil the secrets of proteins but mr hood and his team have crawled steadily up the rankings to be the 13th most prolific team , contributing more than 300 computers to the endeavour .
earning processing points and having rankings gives people something to aim for , aside from the greater humanitarian goals , according to mr hood .
each protein has to be analysed five separate times to be sure of results .
the hope is that a better understanding of the roles certain proteins have will lead to the development of cures or better treatments for diseases like cancer , hiv / aids , and malaria .
protein analyses can take years to complete on powerful supercomputers alone .
a global network of desktop computing power doing the analysing means that time can be reduced to a matter of months .
the wcg project , backed by ibm , is similar to others , like the successful seti @ home run by the search for extra terrestrial life project which examined radio signals for signs of alien communication .
another , the smallpox research grid , linked together more than two million volunteers from 226 countries to speed-up analysis of 35 million drug molecules in the search for a treatment .
the subjects of study for the wcg teams are chosen by an international advisory board of experts specialising in health sciences and technology .
the board evaluates proposals from leading research , public , and not-for-profit organisations , and aims to be involved in up to six projects a year .

" it makes me feel great because it is easy to sit back and let it run , " graham hood , a community administrator for the 63-member my online team , told the bbc news website .
" i ca n't think of a better way to put spare time into good use , " added the watchmaker based in birmingham .
by the time the project ends it is predicted that more than 20,000 years of computing will have been done .
technical trouble-shooter as well as being a keen " protein cruncher " , mr hood has also filled the role of technical trouble-shooter for those in the wcg community who fear viruses - not the biological kind .
participants only need to know how to install the software - no other expertise is required to be part of the effort .
but that means some who take part may not necessarily be so savvy about technology and computer security either , which could cause problems .
the software required to take part in the wcg is small , simple , and does its calculations without users realising it .
if you took 10,000 people and said it is costing you this amount a week to run your computer , would you prepared to donate that money to charity or put this program on the computer and it costs you nothing ?
graham hood , my online team small , encrypted files of protein data are automatically downloaded via a secure server when users connect to the net .
with the current concern over spyware and viruses , wcg members have needed to ensure they remain secure online , but configure their systems to let the right kind of encrypted data in and out .
spyware are programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers to gather information about users .
they can slow computer processors and clog systems .
" if you have a pc at home , it is more simple , " said mr hood .
" but if you are in corporation and you want to put 40 computers on the grid , due to the fact that networks have to be so secure , firewalls will block information getting back to the grid .
" people have to get past the firewall in a safe manner . "
on the community 's forums , advice is given out readily .
the project is also a way of contributing to a good cause that avoids scam " charity e-mail " phishing attempts - e-mails which pretend to be from legitimate charities .
this kind of scam recently hit tsunami relief fund-raising efforts .
" if you took 10,000 people and said it is costing you this amount a week to run your computer , would you prepared to donate that money to charity or put this program on the computer and it costs you nothing ? "
of course , a resource like cash is always a welcome relief for charities too , but at least computers which get more powerful year on year can do something useful , too .
premier processing league the teams and individuals also earn points for the processing and calculations each has done .
those with the most points , worked out and balanced against the specification of the computer and net connections speeds , are ranked in a league .
the " premiership " tends to comprise those who might have more than one processor linked up to the wcg .
" one person from hollywood has a render farm with 30 processors in it .
so he is doing in one day what i have done in three months , " explained mr hood .
the first wcg project is trying to unveil the secrets of proteins but mr hood and his team have crawled steadily up the rankings to be the 13th most prolific team , contributing more than 300 computers to the endeavour .
earning processing points and having rankings gives people something to aim for , aside from the greater humanitarian goals , according to mr hood .
each protein has to be analysed five separate times to be sure of results .
the hope is that a better understanding of the roles certain proteins have will lead to the development of cures or better treatments for diseases like cancer , hiv / aids , and malaria .
protein analyses can take years to complete on powerful supercomputers alone .
a global network of desktop computing power doing the analysing means that time can be reduced to a matter of months .
the wcg project , backed by ibm , is similar to others , like the successful seti @ home run by the search for extra terrestrial life project which examined radio signals for signs of alien communication .
another , the smallpox research grid , linked together more than two million volunteers from 226 countries to speed-up analysis of 35 million drug molecules in the search for a treatment .
the subjects of study for the wcg teams are chosen by an international advisory board of experts specialising in health sciences and technology .
the board evaluates proposals from leading research , public , and not-for-profit organisations , and aims to be involved in up to six projects a year .

the 98 properties in the derwent area will be made available to families needing homes .
there are 10,000 people are on the council 's waiting list .
the houses were boarded up after the number of asylum seekers being housed in the city was reduced .
people will be able to move in once the houses have been checked over in march . "
it was a foolhardy exercise in the first place " philip hickson , derby city council the houses were leased out to a housing association through the national asylum support service and negotiations .
derby city council had to reclaim them even though they were empty .
councillor philip hickson , deputy leader and cabinet member for housing , said : " some of them were in what were called ' difficult to let areas ' .
" the number of people waiting for houses has risen sharply , probably a reflection of the very steep rise in house prices .
' foolhardy exercise ' " people are unable to get on the property ladder and ' difficult-to-let ' areas have vanished as far as derby is concerned .
" we can let every single house that we 've got available - so the sooner we get them back the better .
" it was a foolhardy exercise in the first place , we should never have entered into a contract to provide asylum seeker housing whilst we 'd got large numbers of people on the housing list .
" they were good intentions at the time , but not practical and certainly not in the best interests of the people in the city . "

mr johnson also claimed tony blair 's intervention in the row was " an attempt to reassure jewish voters " .
london mayor mr livingstone says he is " standing by " his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a " concentration camp guard " .
but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry .
' butt out ' labour 's mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist , and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked .
later the prime minister said : " a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time , but in the circumstances , and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist , yes , he should apologise . "
ken does n't think he 's got anything to say sorry for and if that 's really his feeling , then i think that he should stick to his guns boris johnson however , mr johnson , who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley , said mr blair " should butt out of " the row .
" i do n't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this , " the spectator editor told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" it 's a dispute between ken livingstone and a reporter on the evening standard . "
mr johnson , mp for henley-on-thames , oxfordshire , said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters " because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war " .
mr johnson says he has been involved in the ' grovelling game ' " ken does n't think he 's got anything to say sorry for and if that 's really his feeling , then i think that he should stick to his guns , " he said .
mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an " outdated stereotype " of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley .
the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status .
it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster in which 96 died .
mr johnson told today : " it 's perfectly true that i got into the grovelling game myself and when i apologised there were some things that i felt i ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things i did n't think i should apologise for , " he said .
" but here 's old ken - he 's been crass , he 's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but i do n't think actually if you read what he said , although it was extraordinary and rude , i do n't think he was actually anti-semitic . "

mr johnson also claimed tony blair 's intervention in the row was " an attempt to reassure jewish voters " .
london mayor mr livingstone says he is " standing by " his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a " concentration camp guard " .
but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry .
' butt out ' labour 's mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist , and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked .
later the prime minister said : " a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time , but in the circumstances , and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist , yes , he should apologise . "
ken does n't think he 's got anything to say sorry for and if that 's really his feeling , then i think that he should stick to his guns boris johnson however , mr johnson , who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley , said mr blair " should butt out of " the row .

mr johnson says he has been involved in the ' grovelling game ' " ken does n't think he 's got anything to say sorry for and if that 's really his feeling , then i think that he should stick to his guns , " he said .
mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an " outdated stereotype " of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley .
the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status .
it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster in which 96 died .
mr johnson told today : " it 's perfectly true that i got into the grovelling game myself and when i apologised there were some things that i felt i ought to say sorry for ... there were also other things i did n't think i should apologise for , " he said .
" but here 's old ken - he 's been crass , he 's been insensitive and thuggish and brutal in his language - but i do n't think actually if you read what he said , although it was extraordinary and rude , i do n't think he was actually anti-semitic . "

mr johnson also claimed tony blair 's intervention in the row was " an attempt to reassure jewish voters " .
london mayor mr livingstone says he is " standing by " his remarks which likened an evening standard journalist to a " concentration camp guard " .
but the prime minister says it is time for mr livingstone to say sorry .
' butt out ' labour 's mr livingstone has said his comments may have been offensive but were not racist , and said earlier this week he would not apologise even if mr blair asked .
later the prime minister said : " a lot of us in politics get angry with journalists from time to time , but in the circumstances , and to the journalist because he was a jewish journalist , yes , he should apologise . "
" ken does n't think he 's got anything to say sorry for and if that 's really his feeling , then i think that he should stick to his guns " boris johnson however , mr johnson , who was forced to apologise last year for an article in the magazine he edits about liverpudlians grieving over the death of british hostage ken bigley , said mr blair " should butt out of " the row .
" i do n't see why the prime minister has to get involved in this , " the spectator editor told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" it 's a dispute between ken livingstone and a reporter on the evening standard . "
mr johnson , mp for henley-on-thames , oxfordshire , said he suspected labour was now trying to reassure jewish voters " because of this curious way in which labour seems to be trying to curry favour with disillusioned muslim voters who may be disillusioned about the war " .
" ken does n't think he 's got anything to say sorry for and if that 's really his feeling , then i think that he should stick to his guns , " he said .
mr johnson apologised last october for perpetuating an " outdated stereotype " of liverpool in the leader article on the death of mr bigley .
the article in the magazine suggested grieving liverpudlians were wallowing in their victim status .
it also attributed blame to drunken liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster in which 96 died .

online role playing games are time-consuming , but enthralling flights from reality .
but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously ?
when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning .
" an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time , " wrote travis anderson , in texas .
some of the comments were humorous : " this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it , " wrote charles macintyre , from england .
i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness anonymous ' gaming widow ' review : world of warcraft head to head : is online gaming bad for you ?
but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmorpg -rrb- : " ' you need to get out more ' could be the motto of any mmorpg .
shame they are getting more popular , as you know this problem is just going to mushroom , " wrote stuart stanton-davies , in huddersfield .
scare-mongering articles about " addictive video games " have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices .
read your views on online gaming gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession , whether it is spending too much time in the gym , in front of the television , or reading poetry .
distressing impact unfortunately , gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make .
however , stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent .
and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some .
everquest ii transports players to a new world massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds .
the scope of these games - like warcraft , everquest , ultima among others - is epic , and exploration and adventure is almost infinite .
part of the " problem " is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded , mindless tasks , to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure .
such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing ; not for no reason is everquest -lrb- eq -rrb- nicknamed evercrack .
e hayot , writing in the culture blogzine print culture , said recently : " i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot .
" by ' a lot ' , i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average , and on weeks where i did n't have to work , as many as 30 or 40 hours . "
' more fun ' he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour " was n't that unusual ; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much " .
" you lie ; you do n't go into work because you " had stuff to do at home " ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner , you spend much less time watching tv -lrb- a good thing , presumably -rrb- , " he wrote , explaining how everquest took over his time .
he quit the game , he says , because he realised life was more fun than everquest .
everquest is dubbed evercrack by some let us be clear - such obsession is rare .
but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far .
almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month .
only a fraction will descend into obsessives .
the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind .
jane , who runs the website , compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories .
" i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ' some ' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality , " she said .
one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote : " on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do , i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me .
' so distracted ' " i ca n't talk to him while he is playing .
there is absolutely no point as he does n't hear me or is so distracted that i get a ' ummm ... ya ' a few minutes after i ask him a question . "
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game anonymous " gaming widows " has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers .
but for some it is not in the least funny .
another correspondent wrote : " i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness . "
and some of them are even sadder : " today our son was five days old .
" the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game .
he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online . "
video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised .
but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream , and games ever more immersive , there will be no hiding place for social problems .
this forum is now closed .
but read a selection of your comments below .
i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is n't .
an 11 hour stretch is n't that surprising - i 've known people to play 15 + hours at a stretch .
i know of people who are spending their week 's holiday from work playing warcraft .
i know of people who would play ever -lsb- crack -rsb- in shifts ... waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they ' needed ' to appear .
i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life .
by all standards many of us are addicts .
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing .. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting ?
nigel smith , bristol sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming , i find myself longing to have the time to join them .
i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began , games have become more and more complex .
and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them , with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time .
pondscum , london , uk i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct .
i play games a lot , definately over 20 hours a week , but i do n't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games .
jonathan bushell , reading , uk i have , about a year ago , deleted every game on my computer .
rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword .
unlike books , or perhaps even tv , you gain absolutely nothing .
when you stop playing you 're at the same point as when you started ; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and , since you 've gained nothing in the real world , you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one .
james , london despite having little monetary value , the " rewards " and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily .
if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition .
perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality ?
mike , london my advice to gaming widows is " if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em " .
that is , try playing it yourself .
if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .
i still play now , but without the guilt , hehe , how long have i played in one sitting ?
from morning till the early hours of the next day , the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain , i would hardly eat , perhaps some toast , smoke endlessly and drink .
now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .
an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be " real " any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human .
if mmorpgs have a unique danger , in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour , it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world , but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7 .
the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .
dan hemmens , oxford , england the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them , there 's always another quest to do .
a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday ...
michael a , stockport , uk championship manager consumed my life for years .
one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday , paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session .
the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of " hardcore gaming " seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game .
i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that .
alan donald , shetland , scotland i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college .
it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one .
i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate .
i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did , others were less fortunate and dropped out of college .
now that i am holding a job , i avoid online rpgs like the plague .
a former addict , dubai , uae when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5 : pm .
when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well , hence justifying playing it all evening .
i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job .
anonymous , bristol uk when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i 'm trying not to spend so much time on there .
it 's not easy .
i feel as if i 've got a real addiction going on here .
stuart o. southampton , uk .
for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal .
once it is completed that is it , i am finished , time to move on .
i become obsessed to complete the goal , so from that standpoint it is an addiction .
in a game where you will never complete an " ultimate " goal , well it would be like falling into a black pit .
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are " easier " and more fun than the real world .
pretty scary implications if you think about it .
robert m. , linconshire i ca n't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage , i just know it ! !
eoin , ireland i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games .
they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly , but this progress becomes exponentially slower , requiring more and more time to reach the next level .
i 'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor , slowly building up my character , stopping only for food and toilet breaks .
thankfully i made a clean break , and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ 800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum .
darren coleman , westbury , uk seven years ago , i began playing ultima online .
this game dominated 2 years of my life .
they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had .
online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others .
something that can not always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life .
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games , i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv .
david , bournemouth , uk gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction .
when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year , building up my stats , completing evermore quests and battling ogres .
but somehow i found time to get out , even met someone and got married !
has my life changed ?
hell no !
i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning .
on with the fun !
victor tan , london online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television , or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates .
mark , cardiff many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families , relationships and good careers .
a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted .
according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs .
the message to the government is clear , either legalise drugs , or outlaw online gaming ! !
tom , london , uk sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all .
i play alot of warcraft myself , and know full well how addictive it is .
i am resolute that it will not take over my life .
it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .
monstro , brighton uk i think i 'm obsessed with gaming in general , i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to , i 'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i 'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united .
byron hinson , cambridge i am obsessed with online role playing games .
it 's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc .
i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning ...
mark , swansea , wales as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively .
furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect , whereas other games and some other pursuits -lrb- such as being a couch potato -rrb- the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature .
steve kissane , birmingham these games are like most things - too much of anything is a bad thing , but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too , they can be great fun .
jonti , bern , switzerland living in korea at the moment , they have lots pc bangs -lrb- internet cafes -rrb- .
nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games , and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games .
david , busan , south korea i play xbox live every day .
i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix .
the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session .
i know i play for to long but it 's an obsession that i ca n't control .
can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up ... but something i 'm increasingly concerned with ...
gareth rooney , belfast me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day , we 're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv , trying to ' frag ' some individual .
it 's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming , and enjoying ' real ' life ...
duncan , salisbury , england i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out .
the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight .
i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive , but have subsequently just bought the european version -lrb- could n't help myself -rrb- .
in future , i 'm going to regulate my time far more strictly .
great game !
jonathan , london having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking .
but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment .
most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into .
sean , lancing , uk unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person ¿ s health , you can expect this not to decline but to get worse .
james lamont , norwich these people are pathetic .
they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and " online universe " absolutely meaningless .
matt , beijing , china 24hours , when i was a kid at school and i was on half term , ultima online was the game , ahhhh them was the days !

and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them , with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time .
pondscum , london , uk i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct .
i play games a lot , definately over 20 hours a week , but i do n't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games .
jonathan bushell , reading , uk i have , about a year ago , deleted every game on my computer .
rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword .
unlike books , or perhaps even tv , you gain absolutely nothing .
when you stop playing you 're at the same point as when you started ; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and , since you 've gained nothing in the real world , you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one .
james , london despite having little monetary value , the " rewards " and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily .
if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition .
perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality ?
mike , london my advice to gaming widows is " if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em " .
that is , try playing it yourself .
if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .
i still play now , but without the guilt , hehe , how long have i played in one sitting ?
from morning till the early hours of the next day , the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain , i would hardly eat , perhaps some toast , smoke endlessly and drink .
now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .
an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be " real " any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human .
if mmorpgs have a unique danger , in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour , it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world , but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7 .
the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .
dan hemmens , oxford , england the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them , there 's always another quest to do .
a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday ...
michael a , stockport , uk championship manager consumed my life for years .
one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday , paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session .
the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of " hardcore gaming " seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game .
i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that .
alan donald , shetland , scotland i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college .
it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one .
i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate .
i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did , others were less fortunate and dropped out of college .
now that i am holding a job , i avoid online rpgs like the plague .
a former addict , dubai , uae when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5 : pm .
when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well , hence justifying playing it all evening .
i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job .
anonymous , bristol uk when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i 'm trying not to spend so much time on there .
it 's not easy .
i feel as if i 've got a real addiction going on here .
stuart o. southampton , uk .
for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal .
once it is completed that is it , i am finished , time to move on .
i become obsessed to complete the goal , so from that standpoint it is an addiction .
in a game where you will never complete an " ultimate " goal , well it would be like falling into a black pit .
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are " easier " and more fun than the real world .
pretty scary implications if you think about it .
robert m. , linconshire i ca n't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage , i just know it ! !
eoin , ireland i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games .
they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly , but this progress becomes exponentially slower , requiring more and more time to reach the next level .
i 'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor , slowly building up my character , stopping only for food and toilet breaks .
thankfully i made a clean break , and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ 800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum .
darren coleman , westbury , uk seven years ago , i began playing ultima online .
this game dominated 2 years of my life .
they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had .
online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others .
something that can not always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life .
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games , i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv .
david , bournemouth , uk gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction .
when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year , building up my stats , completing evermore quests and battling ogres .
but somehow i found time to get out , even met someone and got married !
has my life changed ?
hell no !
i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning .
on with the fun !
victor tan , london online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television , or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates .
mark , cardiff many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families , relationships and good careers .
a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted .
according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs .
the message to the government is clear , either legalise drugs , or outlaw online gaming ! !
tom , london , uk sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all .
i play alot of warcraft myself , and know full well how addictive it is .
i am resolute that it will not take over my life .
it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .
monstro , brighton uk i think i 'm obsessed with gaming in general , i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to , i 'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i 'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united .
byron hinson , cambridge i am obsessed with online role playing games .
it 's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc .
i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning ...
mark , swansea , wales as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively .
furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect , whereas other games and some other pursuits -lrb- such as being a couch potato -rrb- the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature .
steve kissane , birmingham these games are like most things - too much of anything is a bad thing , but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too , they can be great fun .
jonti , bern , switzerland living in korea at the moment , they have lots pc bangs -lrb- internet cafes -rrb- .
nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games , and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games .
david , busan , south korea i play xbox live every day .
i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix .
the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session .
i know i play for to long but it 's an obsession that i ca n't control .
can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up ... but something i 'm increasingly concerned with ...
gareth rooney , belfast me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day , we 're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv , trying to ' frag ' some individual .
it 's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming , and enjoying ' real ' life ...
duncan , salisbury , england i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out .
the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight .
i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive , but have subsequently just bought the european version -lrb- could n't help myself -rrb- .
in future , i 'm going to regulate my time far more strictly .
great game !
jonathan , london having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking .
but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment .
most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into .
sean , lancing , uk unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person ¿ s health , you can expect this not to decline but to get worse .
james lamont , norwich these people are pathetic .
they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and " online universe " absolutely meaningless .
matt , beijing , china 24hours , when i was a kid at school and i was on half term , ultima online was the game , ahhhh them was the days !

online role playing games are time-consuming , but enthralling flights from reality .
but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously ?
when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning .
" an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time , " wrote travis anderson , in texas .
some of the comments were humorous : " this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it , " wrote charles macintyre , from england .
i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness anonymous ' gaming widow ' review : world of warcraft head to head : is online gaming bad for you ?
but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmorpg -rrb- : " ' you need to get out more ' could be the motto of any mmorpg .
shame they are getting more popular , as you know this problem is just going to mushroom , " wrote stuart stanton-davies , in huddersfield .
scare-mongering articles about " addictive video games " have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices .
read your views on online gaming gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession , whether it is spending too much time in the gym , in front of the television , or reading poetry .
distressing impact unfortunately , gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make .
however , stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent .
and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some .
everquest ii transports players to a new world massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds .
the scope of these games - like warcraft , everquest , ultima among others - is epic , and exploration and adventure is almost infinite .
part of the " problem " is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded , mindless tasks , to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure .
such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing ; not for no reason is everquest -lrb- eq -rrb- nicknamed evercrack .
e hayot , writing in the culture blogzine print culture , said recently : " i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot .
" by ' a lot ' , i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average , and on weeks where i did n't have to work , as many as 30 or 40 hours . "
' more fun ' he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour " was n't that unusual ; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much " .
" you lie ; you do n't go into work because you " had stuff to do at home " ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner , you spend much less time watching tv -lrb- a good thing , presumably -rrb- , " he wrote , explaining how everquest took over his time .
he quit the game , he says , because he realised life was more fun than everquest .
everquest is dubbed evercrack by some let us be clear - such obsession is rare .
but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far .
almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month .
only a fraction will descend into obsessives .
the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind .
jane , who runs the website , compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories .
" i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ' some ' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality , " she said .
one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote : " on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do , i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me .
' so distracted ' " i ca n't talk to him while he is playing .
there is absolutely no point as he does n't hear me or is so distracted that i get a ' ummm ... ya ' a few minutes after i ask him a question . "
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game anonymous " gaming widows " has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers .
but for some it is not in the least funny .
another correspondent wrote : " i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness . "
and some of them are even sadder : " today our son was five days old .
" the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game .
he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online . "
video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised .
but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream , and games ever more immersive , there will be no hiding place for social problems .
this forum is now closed .
but read a selection of your comments below .
i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is n't .
an 11 hour stretch is n't that surprising - i 've known people to play 15 + hours at a stretch .
i know of people who are spending their week 's holiday from work playing warcraft .
i know of people who would play ever -lsb- crack -rsb- in shifts ... waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they ' needed ' to appear .
i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life .
by all standards many of us are addicts .
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing .. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting ?

when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning .
" an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time , " wrote travis anderson , in texas .
some of the comments were humorous : " this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it , " wrote charles macintyre , from england .
i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness anonymous ' gaming widow ' review : world of warcraft head to head : is online gaming bad for you ?
but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmorpg -rrb- : " ' you need to get out more ' could be the motto of any mmorpg .
shame they are getting more popular , as you know this problem is just going to mushroom , " wrote stuart stanton-davies , in huddersfield .
scare-mongering articles about " addictive video games " have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices .
read your views on online gaming gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession , whether it is spending too much time in the gym , in front of the television , or reading poetry .
distressing impact unfortunately , gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make .
however , stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent .
and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some .
everquest ii transports players to a new world massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds .
the scope of these games - like warcraft , everquest , ultima among others - is epic , and exploration and adventure is almost infinite .
part of the " problem " is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded , mindless tasks , to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure .
such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing ; not for no reason is everquest -lrb- eq -rrb- nicknamed evercrack .
e hayot , writing in the culture blogzine print culture , said recently : " i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot .
" by ' a lot ' , i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average , and on weeks where i did n't have to work , as many as 30 or 40 hours . "
' more fun ' he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour " was n't that unusual ; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much " .
" you lie ; you do n't go into work because you " had stuff to do at home " ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner , you spend much less time watching tv -lrb- a good thing , presumably -rrb- , " he wrote , explaining how everquest took over his time .
he quit the game , he says , because he realised life was more fun than everquest .
everquest is dubbed evercrack by some let us be clear - such obsession is rare .
but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far .
almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month .
only a fraction will descend into obsessives .
the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind .
jane , who runs the website , compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories .
" i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ' some ' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality , " she said .
one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote : " on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do , i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me .
' so distracted ' " i ca n't talk to him while he is playing .
there is absolutely no point as he does n't hear me or is so distracted that i get a ' ummm ... ya ' a few minutes after i ask him a question . "
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game anonymous " gaming widows " has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers .
but for some it is not in the least funny .
another correspondent wrote : " i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness . "
and some of them are even sadder : " today our son was five days old .
" the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game .
he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online . "
video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised .
but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream , and games ever more immersive , there will be no hiding place for social problems .
this forum is now closed .
but read a selection of your comments below .
i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is n't .
an 11 hour stretch is n't that surprising - i 've known people to play 15 + hours at a stretch .
i know of people who are spending their week 's holiday from work playing warcraft .
i know of people who would play ever -lsb- crack -rsb- in shifts ... waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they ' needed ' to appear .
i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life .
by all standards many of us are addicts .
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing .. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting ?
nigel smith , bristol sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming , i find myself longing to have the time to join them .
i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began , games have become more and more complex .
and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them , with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time .
pondscum , london , uk i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct .
i play games a lot , definately over 20 hours a week , but i do n't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games .
jonathan bushell , reading , uk i have , about a year ago , deleted every game on my computer .
rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword .
unlike books , or perhaps even tv , you gain absolutely nothing .
when you stop playing you 're at the same point as when you started ; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and , since you 've gained nothing in the real world , you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one .
james , london despite having little monetary value , the " rewards " and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily .
if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition .
perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality ?
mike , london my advice to gaming widows is " if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em " .
that is , try playing it yourself .
if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .
i still play now , but without the guilt , hehe , how long have i played in one sitting ?
from morning till the early hours of the next day , the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain , i would hardly eat , perhaps some toast , smoke endlessly and drink .
now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .
an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be " real " any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human .
if mmorpgs have a unique danger , in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour , it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world , but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7 .
the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .
dan hemmens , oxford , england the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them , there 's always another quest to do .
a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday ...
michael a , stockport , uk championship manager consumed my life for years .
one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday , paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session .
the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of " hardcore gaming " seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game .
i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that .
alan donald , shetland , scotland i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college .
it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one .
i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate .
i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did , others were less fortunate and dropped out of college .
now that i am holding a job , i avoid online rpgs like the plague .
a former addict , dubai , uae when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5 : pm .
when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well , hence justifying playing it all evening .
i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job .
anonymous , bristol uk when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i 'm trying not to spend so much time on there .
it 's not easy .
i feel as if i 've got a real addiction going on here .
stuart o. southampton , uk .
for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal .
once it is completed that is it , i am finished , time to move on .
i become obsessed to complete the goal , so from that standpoint it is an addiction .
in a game where you will never complete an " ultimate " goal , well it would be like falling into a black pit .
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are " easier " and more fun than the real world .
pretty scary implications if you think about it .
robert m. , linconshire i ca n't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage , i just know it ! !
eoin , ireland i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games .
they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly , but this progress becomes exponentially slower , requiring more and more time to reach the next level .
i 'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor , slowly building up my character , stopping only for food and toilet breaks .
thankfully i made a clean break , and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ 800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum .
darren coleman , westbury , uk seven years ago , i began playing ultima online .
this game dominated 2 years of my life .
they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had .
online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others .
something that can not always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life .
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games , i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv .
david , bournemouth , uk gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction .
when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year , building up my stats , completing evermore quests and battling ogres .
but somehow i found time to get out , even met someone and got married !
has my life changed ?
hell no !
i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning .
on with the fun !
victor tan , london online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television , or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates .
mark , cardiff many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families , relationships and good careers .
a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted .
according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs .
the message to the government is clear , either legalise drugs , or outlaw online gaming ! !
tom , london , uk sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all .
i play alot of warcraft myself , and know full well how addictive it is .
i am resolute that it will not take over my life .
it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .
monstro , brighton uk i think i 'm obsessed with gaming in general , i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to , i 'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i 'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united .
byron hinson , cambridge i am obsessed with online role playing games .
it 's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc .
i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning ...
mark , swansea , wales as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively .
furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect , whereas other games and some other pursuits -lrb- such as being a couch potato -rrb- the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature .
steve kissane , birmingham these games are like most things - too much of anything is a bad thing , but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too , they can be great fun .
jonti , bern , switzerland living in korea at the moment , they have lots pc bangs -lrb- internet cafes -rrb- .
nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games , and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games .
david , busan , south korea i play xbox live every day .
i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix .
the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session .
i know i play for to long but it 's an obsession that i ca n't control .
can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up ... but something i 'm increasingly concerned with ...
gareth rooney , belfast me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day , we 're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv , trying to ' frag ' some individual .
it 's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming , and enjoying ' real ' life ...
duncan , salisbury , england i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out .
the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight .
i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive , but have subsequently just bought the european version -lrb- could n't help myself -rrb- .
in future , i 'm going to regulate my time far more strictly .
great game !
jonathan , london having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking .
but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment .
most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into .
sean , lancing , uk unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person ¿ s health , you can expect this not to decline but to get worse .
james lamont , norwich these people are pathetic .
they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and " online universe " absolutely meaningless .
matt , beijing , china 24hours , when i was a kid at school and i was on half term , ultima online was the game , ahhhh them was the days !

it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .
monstro , brighton uk i think i 'm obsessed with gaming in general , i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to , i 'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i 'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united .
byron hinson , cambridge i am obsessed with online role playing games .
it 's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc .
i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning ...
mark , swansea , wales as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively .
furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect , whereas other games and some other pursuits -lrb- such as being a couch potato -rrb- the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature .
steve kissane , birmingham these games are like most things - too much of anything is a bad thing , but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too , they can be great fun .
jonti , bern , switzerland living in korea at the moment , they have lots pc bangs -lrb- internet cafes -rrb- .
nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games , and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games .
david , busan , south korea i play xbox live every day .
i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix .
the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session .
i know i play for to long but it 's an obsession that i ca n't control .
can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up ... but something i 'm increasingly concerned with ...
gareth rooney , belfast me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day , we 're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv , trying to ' frag ' some individual .
it 's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming , and enjoying ' real ' life ...
duncan , salisbury , england i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out .
the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight .
i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive , but have subsequently just bought the european version -lrb- could n't help myself -rrb- .
in future , i 'm going to regulate my time far more strictly .
great game !
jonathan , london having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking .
but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment .
most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into .
sean , lancing , uk unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person ¿ s health , you can expect this not to decline but to get worse .
james lamont , norwich these people are pathetic .
they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and " online universe " absolutely meaningless .
matt , beijing , china 24hours , when i was a kid at school and i was on half term , ultima online was the game , ahhhh them was the days !

online role playing games are time-consuming , but enthralling flights from reality .
but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously ?
when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning .
" an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time , " wrote travis anderson , in texas .
some of the comments were humorous : " this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it , " wrote charles macintyre , from england .
i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness anonymous ' gaming widow ' review : world of warcraft head to head : is online gaming bad for you ?
but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmorpg -rrb- : " ' you need to get out more ' could be the motto of any mmorpg .
shame they are getting more popular , as you know this problem is just going to mushroom , " wrote stuart stanton-davies , in huddersfield .
scare-mongering articles about " addictive video games " have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices .
read your views on online gaming gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession , whether it is spending too much time in the gym , in front of the television , or reading poetry .
distressing impact unfortunately , gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make .
however , stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent .
and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some .
everquest ii transports players to a new world massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds .
the scope of these games - like warcraft , everquest , ultima among others - is epic , and exploration and adventure is almost infinite .
part of the " problem " is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded , mindless tasks , to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure .
such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing ; not for no reason is everquest -lrb- eq -rrb- nicknamed evercrack .
e hayot , writing in the culture blogzine print culture , said recently : " i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot .
" by ' a lot ' , i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average , and on weeks where i did n't have to work , as many as 30 or 40 hours . "
' more fun ' he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour " was n't that unusual ; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much " .
" you lie ; you do n't go into work because you " had stuff to do at home " ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner , you spend much less time watching tv -lrb- a good thing , presumably -rrb- , " he wrote , explaining how everquest took over his time .
he quit the game , he says , because he realised life was more fun than everquest .
everquest is dubbed evercrack by some let us be clear - such obsession is rare .
but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far .
almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month .
only a fraction will descend into obsessives .
the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind .
jane , who runs the website , compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories .
" i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ' some ' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality , " she said .
one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote : " on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do , i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me .
' so distracted ' " i ca n't talk to him while he is playing .
there is absolutely no point as he does n't hear me or is so distracted that i get a ' ummm ... ya ' a few minutes after i ask him a question . "
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game anonymous " gaming widows " has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers .
but for some it is not in the least funny .
another correspondent wrote : " i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness . "
and some of them are even sadder : " today our son was five days old .
" the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game .
he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online . "
video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised .
but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream , and games ever more immersive , there will be no hiding place for social problems .
this forum is now closed .
but read a selection of your comments below .
i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is n't .
an 11 hour stretch is n't that surprising - i 've known people to play 15 + hours at a stretch .
i know of people who are spending their week 's holiday from work playing warcraft .
i know of people who would play ever -lsb- crack -rsb- in shifts ... waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they ' needed ' to appear .
i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life .
by all standards many of us are addicts .
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing .. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting ?
nigel smith , bristol sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming , i find myself longing to have the time to join them .
i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began , games have become more and more complex .
and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them , with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time .
pondscum , london , uk i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct .
i play games a lot , definately over 20 hours a week , but i do n't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games .
jonathan bushell , reading , uk i have , about a year ago , deleted every game on my computer .
rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword .
unlike books , or perhaps even tv , you gain absolutely nothing .
when you stop playing you 're at the same point as when you started ; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and , since you 've gained nothing in the real world , you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one .
james , london despite having little monetary value , the " rewards " and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily .
if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition .
perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality ?
mike , london my advice to gaming widows is " if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em " .
that is , try playing it yourself .
if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .
i still play now , but without the guilt , hehe , how long have i played in one sitting ?
from morning till the early hours of the next day , the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain , i would hardly eat , perhaps some toast , smoke endlessly and drink .
now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .
an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be " real " any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human .
if mmorpgs have a unique danger , in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour , it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world , but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7 .
the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .
dan hemmens , oxford , england the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them , there 's always another quest to do .
a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday ...
michael a , stockport , uk championship manager consumed my life for years .
one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday , paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session .
the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of " hardcore gaming " seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game .
i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that .
alan donald , shetland , scotland i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college .
it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one .
i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate .
i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did , others were less fortunate and dropped out of college .
now that i am holding a job , i avoid online rpgs like the plague .
a former addict , dubai , uae when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5 : pm .
when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well , hence justifying playing it all evening .
i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job .
anonymous , bristol uk when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i 'm trying not to spend so much time on there .
it 's not easy .
i feel as if i 've got a real addiction going on here .
stuart o. southampton , uk .
for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal .
once it is completed that is it , i am finished , time to move on .
i become obsessed to complete the goal , so from that standpoint it is an addiction .
in a game where you will never complete an " ultimate " goal , well it would be like falling into a black pit .
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are " easier " and more fun than the real world .
pretty scary implications if you think about it .
robert m. , linconshire i ca n't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage , i just know it ! !
eoin , ireland i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games .
they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly , but this progress becomes exponentially slower , requiring more and more time to reach the next level .
i 'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor , slowly building up my character , stopping only for food and toilet breaks .
thankfully i made a clean break , and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ 800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum .
darren coleman , westbury , uk seven years ago , i began playing ultima online .
this game dominated 2 years of my life .
they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had .
online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others .
something that can not always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life .
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games , i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv .
david , bournemouth , uk gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction .
when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year , building up my stats , completing evermore quests and battling ogres .
but somehow i found time to get out , even met someone and got married !
has my life changed ?
hell no !
i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning .
on with the fun !
victor tan , london online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television , or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates .
mark , cardiff many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families , relationships and good careers .
a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted .
according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs .
the message to the government is clear , either legalise drugs , or outlaw online gaming ! !
tom , london , uk sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all .
i play alot of warcraft myself , and know full well how addictive it is .
i am resolute that it will not take over my life .
it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .

if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .
i still play now , but without the guilt , hehe , how long have i played in one sitting ?
from morning till the early hours of the next day , the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain , i would hardly eat , perhaps some toast , smoke endlessly and drink .
now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .
an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be " real " any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human .
if mmorpgs have a unique danger , in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour , it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world , but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7 .
the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .
dan hemmens , oxford , england the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them , there 's always another quest to do .
a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday ...
michael a , stockport , uk championship manager consumed my life for years .
one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday , paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session .
the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of " hardcore gaming " seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game .
i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that .
alan donald , shetland , scotland i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college .
it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one .
i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate .
i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did , others were less fortunate and dropped out of college .
now that i am holding a job , i avoid online rpgs like the plague .
a former addict , dubai , uae when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5 : pm .
when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well , hence justifying playing it all evening .
i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job .
anonymous , bristol uk when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i 'm trying not to spend so much time on there .
it 's not easy .
i feel as if i 've got a real addiction going on here .
stuart o. southampton , uk .
for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal .
once it is completed that is it , i am finished , time to move on .
i become obsessed to complete the goal , so from that standpoint it is an addiction .
in a game where you will never complete an " ultimate " goal , well it would be like falling into a black pit .
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are " easier " and more fun than the real world .
pretty scary implications if you think about it .
robert m. , linconshire i ca n't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage , i just know it ! !
eoin , ireland i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games .
they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly , but this progress becomes exponentially slower , requiring more and more time to reach the next level .
i 'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor , slowly building up my character , stopping only for food and toilet breaks .
thankfully i made a clean break , and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ 800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum .
darren coleman , westbury , uk seven years ago , i began playing ultima online .
this game dominated 2 years of my life .
they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had .
online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others .
something that can not always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life .
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games , i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv .
david , bournemouth , uk gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction .
when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year , building up my stats , completing evermore quests and battling ogres .
but somehow i found time to get out , even met someone and got married !
has my life changed ?
hell no !
i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning .
on with the fun !
victor tan , london online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television , or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates .
mark , cardiff many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families , relationships and good careers .
a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted .
according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs .
the message to the government is clear , either legalise drugs , or outlaw online gaming ! !
tom , london , uk sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all .
i play alot of warcraft myself , and know full well how addictive it is .
i am resolute that it will not take over my life .
it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .
monstro , brighton uk i think i 'm obsessed with gaming in general , i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to , i 'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i 'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united .
byron hinson , cambridge i am obsessed with online role playing games .
it 's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc .
i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning ...
mark , swansea , wales as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively .
furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect , whereas other games and some other pursuits -lrb- such as being a couch potato -rrb- the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature .
steve kissane , birmingham these games are like most things - too much of anything is a bad thing , but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too , they can be great fun .
jonti , bern , switzerland living in korea at the moment , they have lots pc bangs -lrb- internet cafes -rrb- .
nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games , and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games .
david , busan , south korea i play xbox live every day .
i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix .
the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session .
i know i play for to long but it 's an obsession that i ca n't control .
can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up ... but something i 'm increasingly concerned with ...
gareth rooney , belfast me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day , we 're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv , trying to ' frag ' some individual .
it 's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming , and enjoying ' real ' life ...
duncan , salisbury , england i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out .
the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight .
i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive , but have subsequently just bought the european version -lrb- could n't help myself -rrb- .
in future , i 'm going to regulate my time far more strictly .
great game !
jonathan , london having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking .
but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment .
most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into .
sean , lancing , uk unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person ¿ s health , you can expect this not to decline but to get worse .
james lamont , norwich these people are pathetic .
they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and " online universe " absolutely meaningless .
matt , beijing , china 24hours , when i was a kid at school and i was on half term , ultima online was the game , ahhhh them was the days !

online role playing games are time-consuming , but enthralling flights from reality .
but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously ?
when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning .
" an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time , " wrote travis anderson , in texas .
some of the comments were humorous : " this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it , " wrote charles macintyre , from england .
i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness anonymous ' gaming widow ' review : world of warcraft head to head : is online gaming bad for you ?
but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game -lrb- mmorpg -rrb- : " ' you need to get out more ' could be the motto of any mmorpg .
shame they are getting more popular , as you know this problem is just going to mushroom , " wrote stuart stanton-davies , in huddersfield .
scare-mongering articles about " addictive video games " have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices .
read your views on online gaming gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession , whether it is spending too much time in the gym , in front of the television , or reading poetry .
distressing impact unfortunately , gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make .
however , stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent .
and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some .
everquest ii transports players to a new world massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds .
the scope of these games - like warcraft , everquest , ultima among others - is epic , and exploration and adventure is almost infinite .
part of the " problem " is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded , mindless tasks , to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure .
such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing ; not for no reason is everquest -lrb- eq -rrb- nicknamed evercrack .
e hayot , writing in the culture blogzine print culture , said recently : " i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot .
" by ' a lot ' , i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average , and on weeks where i did n't have to work , as many as 30 or 40 hours . "
' more fun ' he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour " was n't that unusual ; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much " .
" you lie ; you do n't go into work because you " had stuff to do at home " ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner , you spend much less time watching tv -lrb- a good thing , presumably -rrb- , " he wrote , explaining how everquest took over his time .
he quit the game , he says , because he realised life was more fun than everquest .
everquest is dubbed evercrack by some let us be clear - such obsession is rare .
but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far .
almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month .
only a fraction will descend into obsessives .
the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind .
jane , who runs the website , compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories .
" i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ' some ' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality , " she said .
one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote : " on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do , i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me .
' so distracted ' " i ca n't talk to him while he is playing .
there is absolutely no point as he does n't hear me or is so distracted that i get a ' ummm ... ya ' a few minutes after i ask him a question . "
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game anonymous " gaming widows " has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers .
but for some it is not in the least funny .
another correspondent wrote : " i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness . "
and some of them are even sadder : " today our son was five days old .
" the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game .
he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online . "
video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised .
but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream , and games ever more immersive , there will be no hiding place for social problems .
this forum is now closed .
but read a selection of your comments below .
i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is n't .
an 11 hour stretch is n't that surprising - i 've known people to play 15 + hours at a stretch .
i know of people who are spending their week 's holiday from work playing warcraft .
i know of people who would play ever -lsb- crack -rsb- in shifts ... waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they ' needed ' to appear .
i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life .
by all standards many of us are addicts .
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing .. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting ?
nigel smith , bristol sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming , i find myself longing to have the time to join them .
i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began , games have become more and more complex .
and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them , with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time .
pondscum , london , uk i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct .
i play games a lot , definately over 20 hours a week , but i do n't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games .
jonathan bushell , reading , uk i have , about a year ago , deleted every game on my computer .
rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword .
unlike books , or perhaps even tv , you gain absolutely nothing .
when you stop playing you 're at the same point as when you started ; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and , since you 've gained nothing in the real world , you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one .
james , london despite having little monetary value , the " rewards " and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily .
if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition .
perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality ?
mike , london my advice to gaming widows is " if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em " .
that is , try playing it yourself .
if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .

now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .

the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .

however , stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent .
and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some .
everquest ii transports players to a new world massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds .
the scope of these games - like warcraft , everquest , ultima among others - is epic , and exploration and adventure is almost infinite .
part of the " problem " is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded , mindless tasks , to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure .
such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing ; not for no reason is everquest -lrb- eq -rrb- nicknamed evercrack .
e hayot , writing in the culture blogzine print culture , said recently : " i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot .
" by ' a lot ' , i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average , and on weeks where i did n't have to work , as many as 30 or 40 hours . "
' more fun ' he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour " was n't that unusual ; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much " .
" you lie ; you do n't go into work because you " had stuff to do at home " ; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner , you spend much less time watching tv -lrb- a good thing , presumably -rrb- , " he wrote , explaining how everquest took over his time .
he quit the game , he says , because he realised life was more fun than everquest .
everquest is dubbed evercrack by some let us be clear - such obsession is rare .
but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far .
almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month .
only a fraction will descend into obsessives .
the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind .
jane , who runs the website , compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories .
" i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than ' some ' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality , " she said .
one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote : " on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do , i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me .
' so distracted ' " i ca n't talk to him while he is playing .
there is absolutely no point as he does n't hear me or is so distracted that i get a ' ummm ... ya ' a few minutes after i ask him a question . "
the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game anonymous " gaming widows " has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers .
but for some it is not in the least funny .
another correspondent wrote : " i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming , and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness . "
and some of them are even sadder : " today our son was five days old .
" the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game .
he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online . "
video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised .
but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream , and games ever more immersive , there will be no hiding place for social problems .
this forum is now closed .
but read a selection of your comments below .
i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably is n't .
an 11 hour stretch is n't that surprising - i 've known people to play 15 + hours at a stretch .
i know of people who are spending their week 's holiday from work playing warcraft .
i know of people who would play ever -lsb- crack -rsb- in shifts ... waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they ' needed ' to appear .
i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life .
by all standards many of us are addicts .
so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing .. or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting ?
nigel smith , bristol sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming , i find myself longing to have the time to join them .
i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began , games have become more and more complex .
and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them , with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time .
pondscum , london , uk i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct .
i play games a lot , definately over 20 hours a week , but i do n't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games .
jonathan bushell , reading , uk i have , about a year ago , deleted every game on my computer .
rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword .
unlike books , or perhaps even tv , you gain absolutely nothing .
when you stop playing you 're at the same point as when you started ; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and , since you 've gained nothing in the real world , you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one .
james , london despite having little monetary value , the " rewards " and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily .
if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition .
perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality ?
mike , london my advice to gaming widows is " if you ca n't beat ' em , join ' em " .
that is , try playing it yourself .
if he wants to play as well , well at least you 'll be together somewhere ...
ryan , grenoble , france i was an addict and it cost me my relationship .
i still play now , but without the guilt , hehe , how long have i played in one sitting ?
from morning till the early hours of the next day , the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain , i would hardly eat , perhaps some toast , smoke endlessly and drink .
now , thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job .
for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement , and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate .
0ni , glasgow obsessive behaviour is , of course , always cause for concern , but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of " reality " .
obviously , somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem .
this problem , however , has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality .
an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be " real " any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human .
if mmorpgs have a unique danger , in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour , it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world , but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7 .
the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming , but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture .
dan hemmens , oxford , england the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them , there 's always another quest to do .
a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday ...
michael a , stockport , uk championship manager consumed my life for years .
one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday , paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session .
the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of " hardcore gaming " seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game .
i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that .
alan donald , shetland , scotland i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college .
it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one .
i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate .
i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did , others were less fortunate and dropped out of college .
now that i am holding a job , i avoid online rpgs like the plague .
a former addict , dubai , uae when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5 : pm .
when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well , hence justifying playing it all evening .
i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job .
anonymous , bristol uk when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i 'm trying not to spend so much time on there .
it 's not easy .
i feel as if i 've got a real addiction going on here .
stuart o. southampton , uk .
for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal .
once it is completed that is it , i am finished , time to move on .
i become obsessed to complete the goal , so from that standpoint it is an addiction .
in a game where you will never complete an " ultimate " goal , well it would be like falling into a black pit .
it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are " easier " and more fun than the real world .
pretty scary implications if you think about it .
robert m. , linconshire i ca n't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage , i just know it ! !
eoin , ireland i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games .
they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly , but this progress becomes exponentially slower , requiring more and more time to reach the next level .
i 'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor , slowly building up my character , stopping only for food and toilet breaks .
thankfully i made a clean break , and actually managed to sell my jedi account for £ 800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum .
darren coleman , westbury , uk seven years ago , i began playing ultima online .
this game dominated 2 years of my life .
they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had .
online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others .
something that can not always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life .
whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games , i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv .
david , bournemouth , uk gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction .
when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year , building up my stats , completing evermore quests and battling ogres .
but somehow i found time to get out , even met someone and got married !
has my life changed ?
hell no !
i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning .
on with the fun !
victor tan , london online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television , or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates .
mark , cardiff many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families , relationships and good careers .
a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted .
according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs .
the message to the government is clear , either legalise drugs , or outlaw online gaming ! !
tom , london , uk sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all .
i play alot of warcraft myself , and know full well how addictive it is .
i am resolute that it will not take over my life .
it certainly gets in the way though .
i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line , or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it .
monstro , brighton uk i think i 'm obsessed with gaming in general , i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to , i 'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i 'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united .
byron hinson , cambridge i am obsessed with online role playing games .
it 's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc .
i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning ...
mark , swansea , wales as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively .
furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect , whereas other games and some other pursuits -lrb- such as being a couch potato -rrb- the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature .
steve kissane , birmingham these games are like most things - too much of anything is a bad thing , but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too , they can be great fun .
jonti , bern , switzerland living in korea at the moment , they have lots pc bangs -lrb- internet cafes -rrb- .
nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games , and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games .
david , busan , south korea i play xbox live every day .
i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix .
the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session .
i know i play for to long but it 's an obsession that i ca n't control .
can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up ... but something i 'm increasingly concerned with ...
gareth rooney , belfast me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day , we 're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv , trying to ' frag ' some individual .
it 's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming , and enjoying ' real ' life ...
duncan , salisbury , england i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out .
the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight .
i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive , but have subsequently just bought the european version -lrb- could n't help myself -rrb- .
in future , i 'm going to regulate my time far more strictly .
great game !
jonathan , london having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking .
but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment .
most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into .
sean , lancing , uk unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person ¿ s health , you can expect this not to decline but to get worse .
james lamont , norwich these people are pathetic .
they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and " online universe " absolutely meaningless .
matt , beijing , china 24hours , when i was a kid at school and i was on half term , ultima online was the game , ahhhh them was the days !
