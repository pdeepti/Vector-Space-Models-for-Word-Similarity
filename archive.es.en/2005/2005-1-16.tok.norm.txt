it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.01.2005 new german fitness trend makes strides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking it to the streets : nordic walkers in a munich park nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2005 hitler 's plan to kidnap the pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii has been accused of being pro-german during wwii in an attempt to improve the controversial public image of pope pius xii , the vatican has released new documents said to back up an old claim that hitler ordered the kidnapping of the wartime pontiff . the italian conference of roman catholic bishops published details of the nazi plan in its newspaper avvenire over the weekend .
it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .

police arrested the suspect after they found his dna at the crime scene . the 25-year-old man , identified as herisch a. , was arrested almost two days after moshammer , who created clothes for celebrities such as arnold schwarzenegger , was found dead at his munich home on friday .
dna tests at his home enabled police to arrest the iraqi overnight , harald pickert , the officer leading the enquiry , told reporters on sunday . pickert said that moshammer had allegedly offered the man € 2,000 -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- for sexual favors when they met near munich 's main train station on thursday evening .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .

the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.01.2005 new german fitness trend makes strides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking it to the streets : nordic walkers in a munich park nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2005 hitler 's plan to kidnap the pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii has been accused of being pro-german during wwii in an attempt to improve the controversial public image of pope pius xii , the vatican has released new documents said to back up an old claim that hitler ordered the kidnapping of the wartime pontiff . the italian conference of roman catholic bishops published details of the nazi plan in its newspaper avvenire over the weekend .
it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.01.2005 new german fitness trend makes strides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking it to the streets : nordic walkers in a munich park nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

police arrested the suspect after they found his dna at the crime scene . the 25-year-old man , identified as herisch a. , was arrested almost two days after moshammer , who created clothes for celebrities such as arnold schwarzenegger , was found dead at his munich home on friday .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.01.2005 new german fitness trend makes strides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking it to the streets : nordic walkers in a munich park nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said . " now i 'm getting clients with piercings , " he said . jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no spa is too far for germans hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .

but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ? they are everywhere the joggers and rollerbladers used to be : in parks , on woodland paths , even on beaches .
dressed for jogging but carrying a spindly ski pole in each hand , they walk quickly and take long strides , swinging the poles back and forth .
frequently middle aged or older , they walk alone , in pairs , or in groups . they are nordic walkers , the vanguard of a new fitness craze that is sweeping germany .
and many say they are here to stay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking off the beaten path , in chiemgau , southern germany a little history : nordic walking was developed as a summer training method for the finnish cross-country ski and winter-biathlon teams .
the poles were shortened to make up for the fact that the athlete , without skis , would have a shorter stride .
a rolling , heel-to-toe step was devised and combined with alternating arm swings that push the pole into the ground , helping to distribute the walker 's body weight . the result of this integration of upper body exercise and walking is a complete workout : cardiac training that uses some 90 percent of the muscles in the body , according to the german nordic fitness association , the sport 's official umbrella organization in germany .
correctly executed , nordic walking is 40 to 50 percent more effective than regular walking , in terms of benefits and energy use , the dnv says . computer generation first introduced outside of finland as " pole walking , " the sport began its exponential growth trajectory in germany around 2000 .
exactly how many people participate in the sport is unknown .
but based on its germany sales , the finnish walking-stick maker exel estimates the numbers of nordic walkers in german soared from 10,000 in 2001 to 120,000 in 2002 – to around 2.2 million in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cross country ski racers developed the sport the reasons for the sport 's popularity are many , according to theo walther , who runs the theo walther nordic walking school in bonn .
a trained nordic walking instructor since 2002 , walther said a growing interest in preventive medicine in germany has raised interest in nordic walking . " i think more than 50 percent of germans have computer jobs .
they don ’ t move enough and have health problems as a result , " walther said .
" nordic walking can be tailored to people at all ages and stages of fitness or ability . ... it can be done like a competitive sport , but we also do it with handicapped people and in old age homes . " insurer subsidies abetting the boom is the willingness of many german insurers to pay for nordic walking instruction .
faced with frightening national statistics on the rise of chronic illness , back problems and obesity , more and more insurers are subsidising the cost of fitness courses .
the aim is to prevent more expensive-to-treat ailments , such as diabetes , heart disease and slipped discs , down the road . indeed , according to the dnv , studies have tied nordic walking to improvements in areas as diverse as cardiac health , parkinsons disease , migraines , post-op recovery , spinal cord mobility – even impotence . " many of the people who come to us had injuries from other sports , " said robin wiegert of the nordic walking academy in freiburg .
wiegert , already a personal trainer and physical therapist , came to nordic walking two and a half years ago after two knee operations put an end to his jogging . business boom as a result of the boom , businesses like wiegert 's and walther 's have taken off . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles are key to nordic walking " we 're bursting at the seams , " said walther , whose nordic walking training company opened in 2000 and now employs 12 trainers and offers more than 60 courses a year . other industries have felt the effects of nordic fitness as well .
increasingly , hotels , spas and resort towns in germany are creating especially graded trails for nordic walking or nordic snowshoe - the sport 's ski-free winter version .
nature reserves across germany are renaming themselves " nordic walking areas , " hotels are offering nordic walking getaways , and tour operators are selling nordic walking tour packages both at home and abroad . accessible , fun the sporting goods industry has also been glad to exploit the trend , with lightweight poles and specially made athletic shoes – made to absorb impact in the heel rather than the toe - flying off the shelves . but despite the attempt to cash in on the trend , a big part of the sport 's widespread appeal is that it doesn ’ t take much of an investment to get started . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walking near stockholm , sweden " people just need to buy some good poles - they cost between 50 and 100 euros .
and eventually special walking shoes .
but regular running shoes are ok to get started , " said walther .
he also said said taking a beginner course is absolutely necessary , in order to learn the proper technique and prevent injury . ute neff , a graphic designer who regularly spends 10 hours a day at her computer , took her first nordic walking course a year ago .
" i was looking for a good way to get some activity back into my life , " said the 40 year old from bonn . after taking a beginner course , she said , " i loved getting out and moving around .
it feels great , burning all that energy , being out in nature , being with the other people in the course . " ' it 's exhausting ' neff had a message for people who scoff at nordic walking as something for people who are too old or wimpy to do " real " sports . " it is completely exhausting , " she said .
" first of all , it is really not that easy to get the hang of doing it right.you have to re-learn how to walk . " also , she said , if she pushes herself , then she is " completely sweaty and wiped out .
but in a good way .
i feel great for two or three days afterward . " walther acknowledges nordic walking appeals to seniors people because it can be done at a very low-intensity level and is unlikely to lead to injury .
but the image of nordic walking as a " retirees only " pass-time is changing , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2005 hitler 's plan to kidnap the pope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii has been accused of being pro-german during wwii in an attempt to improve the controversial public image of pope pius xii , the vatican has released new documents said to back up an old claim that hitler ordered the kidnapping of the wartime pontiff . the italian conference of roman catholic bishops published details of the nazi plan in its newspaper avvenire over the weekend .
it said adolph hitler gave a direct order to ss general karl friedrich otto wolff to bring pius to germany , but the officer disobeyed and even warned the vatican of the impending danger . " i received the order to kidnap pius personally from hitler , " the paper quoted wolff as saying in testimony he gave to the church in 1972 before he died in germany .
avvenire said the plot to nab the pope was called operation rabat and was allegedly put into action to punish the catholic church for hiding thousands of jews in cloisters during world war ii . the report said once abducted , pius was to be kept in a palace in baden-württemberg in southwestern germany in order to help hitler reduce the influence of christianity so he could push the " universal religion " of nazism .
the plans allegedly also covered the possible contingency of pius ' " elimination " if necessary . the road to sainthood ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ss soliders round up a group of jews , including a small children , in the warsaw ghetto in 1943 .
the latest revelations are likely to be seen by some observers as the stepped up efforts of church officials eager to further the pontiff 's road to sainthood .
pope pius xii , who headed the church from 1939 to 1958 , has long been criticized as remaining silent while jews were persecuted by the nazis across europe . catholic officials have long contended that the church would have risked nazi retribution if pius had spoken out against jewish persecution or if he had excommunicated high-ranking nazis .
but many historians argue the pope was pro-german and that he intentionally stood by as the holocaust took place . some chalk up pius ' closeness to the third reich due to his tenure as the vatican 's ambassador to berlin , known as he was then as cardinal eugenio pacelli .
however , avvenire called pacelli a " skilled diplomat " with a strong aversion to nazism who managed to become pontiff despite heavy opposition from germany . jewish groups have long been critical of the catholic church leadership during world war ii and many are opposed to making pius a saint .
but the vatican has not been deterred and the process will continue in march when many of the church 's documents of his time as pope are examined by a select group of historians . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vatican opens files from start of nazi period in an effort to address critics who say the church did n't do enough to stop the horrors of the holocaust , the vatican is opening its archives from 1922 to 1939 .

mr bush said there was no need to hold any of his officials accountable for mistakes or misjudgements in pre-war planning or managing the aftermath .
in an interview in sunday 's washington post he said that his re-election was an " accountability moment " .
the publication of the interview comes as mr bush prepares for the start of his second term on thursday .
the newspaper asked mr bush why no-one had been held responsible for wrong information about weapons of mass destruction in iraq or mistakes made after the us-led war .
" well , we had an accountability moment , and that 's called the 2004 election , " he replied .
" and the american people listened to different assessments made about what was taking place in iraq , and they looked at the two candidates , and they chose me , for which i 'm grateful . "
on wednesday , intelligence officials confirmed that the us had stopped searching for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
they said the chief us investigator , charles duelfer , was not planning to return to the country .
no troop timetable mr bush would not be drawn on setting a timetable for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq , despite recent comments by secretary of state colin powell that troop numbers could be reduced by the end of this year .
" i am realistic about how quickly a society that has been dominated by a tyrant can become a democracy .
and therefore i am more patient than some , " he said .
when asked why the administration had so far failed to locate osama bin laden , more than three years after the 11 september 2001 attacks on the us , the president responded , " because he 's hiding . "
mr bush said he was " pleased " that bin laden had been isolated by the worldwide hunt for him , adding : " i will be more pleased when he is brought to justice , and i think he will be . "
mr bush will be inaugurated for a second four-year term on thursday in a ceremony on the steps of the us capitol building in washington .

at least ten fly-tips of the material have been found in the colchester area since the start of december 2004 .
those responsible can face fines of £ 20,000 and a jail sentence .
environment officer john parish said : " it is completely irresponsible for anyone to dump asbestos .
it is a hazardous material .
" we greatly appreciate the help of the public in trying to catch the people doing this and hope that this fly-tipping will soon be stopped . "
the fly-tips found contain various types and quantities of asbestos which are likely to have come from a refurbishment project .
asbestos is classified as a hazardous waste and anyone transporting it or accepting it for disposal must a licence from the environment agency .

funded by a national lottery grant the scanner enables a variety of images to be taken and will considerably reduce waiting times .
it takes images from different angles around the body and a computer then processes the images to show a cross-section of tissues and organs .
the installation means that alderman drive will be closed to traffic between thorpe road and percival street but is still accessible on foot .

there are already 13,500 potential passengers for the £ 100,000 -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- " virgin galactic spaceliner " trip , sir richard told the bbc .
the entrepreneur is having five " spaceliners " built in the us by the team which launched the spaceshipone rocket plane last year .
sir richard said he himself , his children and his parents all plan to be on the first flight .
the virgin atlantic airline boss told the bbc 's breakfast with frost the space travel plan " is an extremely exciting project " .
he signed a £ 14m agreement last september with mojave ventures , the company set up by microsoft co-founder paul allen and aviation pioneer burton rutan . "
they can experience weightlessness , they will check out that the earth is round and enjoy space " sir richard branson mojave ventures plans to use the technology developed for spaceshipone - the first privately-developed carrier to go above 100km last june .
virgin galactic passengers will have three to four days ' training in virgin 's " space camp " in the mojave desert in the south-western us , sir richard said .
he said passengers will go up in the mother ship ' eve ' which will launch the space craft at three times the speed of sound .
he described the unique things passengers would experience during a three-and-half-hour trip .
" they can experience weightlessness , they will check out that the earth is round and enjoy space , " he said .
the virgin spaceship the vehicle will have room for at least five passengers a week 's pre-flight training will be required three-hour trip ; several minutes of weightlessness flights to leave from mojave desert , initially tickets to cost about $ 200,000 , perhaps less " then the spacecraft turns into a giant shuttlecock which makes the entry safe and then once it comes back into the earth 's atmosphere it turns back into a space craft which glides down " .
sir richard said it was this change in the shape of the aircraft that greatly increased safety .
" the big difference between our space ship and a nasa space ship is that nasa has to contend with the massive heat build-up as it enters the earth 's atmosphere . "
he said the galactic flight would not face this heat build-up , and this made it " many times safer " than a nasa space ship .
however , he added : " we are pioneering and there are obviously risks attached if you are pioneering anything new " .
sir richard , well-known for his speedboat and ballooning adventures , said that he planned to be on the first flight himself .
he said his children holly and sam and his parents were also interested in being on it .
but , he added , his wife joan was not keen on the idea of going into space .

there are already 13,500 potential passengers for the £ 100,000 -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- " virgin galactic spaceliner " trip , sir richard told the bbc .
the entrepreneur is having five " spaceliners " built in the us by the team which launched the spaceshipone rocket plane last year .
sir richard said he himself , his children and his parents all plan to be on the first flight .
the virgin atlantic airline boss told the bbc 's breakfast with frost the space travel plan " is an extremely exciting project " .
he signed a £ 14m agreement last september with mojave ventures , the company set up by microsoft co-founder paul allen and aviation pioneer burton rutan .
they can experience weightlessness , they will check out that the earth is round and enjoy space sir richard branson mojave ventures plans to use the technology developed for spaceshipone - the first privately-developed carrier to go above 100km last june .
virgin galactic passengers will have three to four days ' training in virgin 's " space camp " in the mojave desert in the south-western us , sir richard said .
he said passengers will go up in the mother ship ' eve ' which will launch the space craft at three times the speed of sound .

" they can experience weightlessness , they will check out that the earth is round and enjoy space , " he said .

sir richard said it was this change in the shape of the aircraft that greatly increased safety .
" the big difference between our space ship and a nasa space ship is that nasa has to contend with the massive heat build-up as it enters the earth 's atmosphere . "
he said the galactic flight would not face this heat build-up , and this made it " many times safer " than a nasa space ship .
however , he added : " we are pioneering and there are obviously risks attached if you are pioneering anything new " .
