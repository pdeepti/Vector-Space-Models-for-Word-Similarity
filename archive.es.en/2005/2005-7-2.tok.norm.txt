thus far , there are nine of them and their popularity is growing . at first glance the elm , east of the german city of hanover , looks like an ordinary forest .
ingrid ehrlichmann used to go for walks here with her husband . today she 's visiting his grave , which is located at the foot of a tree .
two months ago , ehrlichmann had her husband 's urn buried here .
she believes it 's the perfect spot . " the advantage is that there are no subsequent costs and i do n't have to tend the grave .
i can go on holiday without having to ask someone to water the flowers , " ehrlichmann said .
" i plan to leave this village .
so when i do move , i 'll leave my husband behind in a ' neutral ' place which is right for him . " freer , less confining burial place indeed , woodland cemeteries are less costly than conventional cemeteries . in germany , more people than ever before are choosing to be buried anonymously because relatives are often unable or unwilling to maintain graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , gravesites are leased for a period of 20 to 30 years .
when that time is up , the family of the dead either has to renew the lease - and keep paying - or the plot is freed up for a new inhabitant .
the family has to pay for the cost of removing the body and headstone . other options gaining in popularity in germany are the headstone-free , " anonymous " gravesites in regular cemeteries , which are less expensive and come with less responsibility than a normal plot . in all nine of germany 's woodland cemeteries , there are no flowers or gravestones to serve as reminders of those who lie buried here .
still , ingrid ehrlichmann considers it a very personal spot . " we chose this place with great care , " she said .
" we can recognize the tree by the number on it , but we 'd know it even without that .
i can identify with the tree .
i know the spot where the urn lies and that 's important to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of usedom there are plans for another woodland cemetery on usedom , an island in the baltic sea .
usedom resident dieter schön said he would prefer his final resting place to be in a forest rather than under a slab of granite . " the idea of being covered by something heavy does n't much appeal to me .
i have the feeling that everything here in the woods is somewhat freer , less confining , not so cumbersome .
that 's why it 's the best solution for me . " church up in arms still , the idea of establishing a woodland cemetery on usedom has met with resistance . " i would n't be allowed to lay any flowers at this woodland cemetery , not even a plant or a stone , said usedom resident annelie schallock .
" so how am i supposed to remember those buried there with love and joy ? " germany 's catholic church too believes that woodland cemeteries are leading to the erosion of the meaning behind a christian burial .
the church says maintaining a grave is about more than just pulling up weeds . " tending to a grave is n't a bothersome inconvenience , said andreas scholler , a catholic priest .
he added that it is important for humans to know that they have n't just disappeared after their deaths , but " that someone is still looking after me , caring about me .
i have n't simply vanished , been erased , which is why this really is a very significant part of human life . " residents resist woodland burials it 's primarily nearby residents who are opposed to the planned woodland cemetery .
their reasons are more profane .
they feel that a forest ca n't be both a place of leisure and a burial ground . " it 's uncomfortable for all concerned .
for example , if i was taking a group of children for a walk in the forest , completely unsuspecting , and then ran into some mourners it would be awkward for both groups , " said siegfried nast , who lives on usedom . for other residents , it 's an emotional issue .
they do n't want the forest that they played in as children to become a burial site . resident christel schaumkessel said : " i have a strong affiliation to this corner of the woods , and i 'd be very sad if it became a cemetery .
just like a graveyard , a woodland cemetery is a place of rest , contemplation and mourning .
i do n't want it . " the majority of residents here feel the same way , so should the town council vote against it , dieter schön will have to find another final resting place . florian nusch -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breathing new life into old rites germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition .

for six hours , 21 music acts played as part of the series of concerts to raise awareness about global poverty , especially in africa . the mostly young music fans have crowded around the victory column in berlin 's central tiergarten park on saturday afternoon to watch internationally known acts such as a-ha , crosby stills & nash , roxy music and green day as well as german favorites including wir sind helden , silbermond and herbert grönemeyer . german favorites die toten hosen kicked off the concert , electrifying the crowd while reminding the audience that helping africa was the most important part of the event . " this is n't a rock concert .
it 's a demonstration , " campino , the singer from the group , yelled to a jubilant crowd . germans and visitors from around the world packed into the wide boulevard that runs through the downtown park waving banners with the german band 's logo as well as british and argentinian flags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live 8 show in tokyo they and other performers , who each had just about 10 or 15 minutes of stage time , were part of a global concert series on saturday which took in 10 cities and four continents .
the free concerts began with tokyo 's show -lrb- photo -rrb- and with end in venues in north america .
besides berlin and tokyo , the concerts are taking place in london , paris , rome , cornwall in england , philadelphia , barrie in canada , johannesburg and moscow . the shows were the brainchild of british musician amd former frontman of the boomtown rats , bob geldof , who wants to build a critical mass that will pressure leaders of the group of eight major industrialised nations meeting in scotland next week to do more to alleviate poverty , particularly in africa .
goals of the campaign include doubling the amount of aid which goes to africa , relieving the debt of the world 's poorest countries and putting fair trade policies into place to help developing economies . bildunterschrift : irish musician bob geldof , one of the original organizers of live aid concerts in 1985 , poses for the photographers prior to a news conference in london . this series comes 20 years after geldof 's first anti-poverty concert event , live aid .

at the brandenburg gate , they signed a banner carrying the slogan " your voice against poverty . " criticism in berlin however , the show in berlin came in for blistering criticism from event managers , who lambasted the german parliament and the city for not giving sufficient backing .
in a newspaper interview , marek lieberberg , a veteran event manager who is putting on the show in berlin , accused berlin mayor klaus wowereit , german authorities and businesses of " stinginess , ignorance and wilhelminian absurd bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reichstag building he complained that german companies did not come forward to sponsor the event as firms had in the other cities where concerts are being held . he also criticized lawmakers for not allowing the concert to be held on the plaza next to the reichstag , or parliament building . but on saturday , music lovers seemed little concerned about organizational glitches .
many in the audience carried red balloons or t-shirts that read " make poverty history . "
families were strongly represented and children were often hoisted on fathers ' shoulders so they could at least catch a glimpse of the stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans cheer at the live 8 concert in berlin many of the 150,000 spectators had to watch the bands on giant video screens that had been set up since the location 's space limitations meant that only some 40,000 had a direct view of the stage . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin brushed back charges friday from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

thus far , there are nine of them and their popularity is growing . at first glance the elm , east of the german city of hanover , looks like an ordinary forest .
ingrid ehrlichmann used to go for walks here with her husband . today she 's visiting his grave , which is located at the foot of a tree .
two months ago , ehrlichmann had her husband 's urn buried here .
she believes it 's the perfect spot . " the advantage is that there are no subsequent costs and i do n't have to tend the grave .
i can go on holiday without having to ask someone to water the flowers , " ehrlichmann said .
" i plan to leave this village .
so when i do move , i 'll leave my husband behind in a ' neutral ' place which is right for him . " freer , less confining burial place indeed , woodland cemeteries are less costly than conventional cemeteries . in germany , more people than ever before are choosing to be buried anonymously because relatives are often unable or unwilling to maintain graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , gravesites are leased for a period of 20 to 30 years .
when that time is up , the family of the dead either has to renew the lease - and keep paying - or the plot is freed up for a new inhabitant .
the family has to pay for the cost of removing the body and headstone . other options gaining in popularity in germany are the headstone-free , " anonymous " gravesites in regular cemeteries , which are less expensive and come with less responsibility than a normal plot . in all nine of germany 's woodland cemeteries , there are no flowers or gravestones to serve as reminders of those who lie buried here .
still , ingrid ehrlichmann considers it a very personal spot . " we chose this place with great care , " she said .
" we can recognize the tree by the number on it , but we 'd know it even without that .
i can identify with the tree .
i know the spot where the urn lies and that 's important to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of usedom there are plans for another woodland cemetery on usedom , an island in the baltic sea .
usedom resident dieter schön said he would prefer his final resting place to be in a forest rather than under a slab of granite . " the idea of being covered by something heavy does n't much appeal to me .

besides berlin and tokyo , the concerts are taking place in london , paris , rome , cornwall in england , philadelphia , barrie in canada , johannesburg and moscow . the shows were the brainchild of british musician amd former frontman of the boomtown rats , bob geldof , who wants to build a critical mass that will pressure leaders of the group of eight major industrialised nations meeting in scotland next week to do more to alleviate poverty , particularly in africa .

many in the audience carried red balloons or t-shirts that read " make poverty history . "
families were strongly represented and children were often hoisted on fathers ' shoulders so they could at least catch a glimpse of the stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans cheer at the live 8 concert in berlin many of the 150,000 spectators had to watch the bands on giant video screens that had been set up since the location 's space limitations meant that only some 40,000 had a direct view of the stage . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin brushed back charges friday from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2005 finding final peace in the forest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woodlands are increasingly favored as burial spots the one soft spot in germany 's otherwise rigid burial practices are friedwälder , forests especially set aside to allow headstone-free burials in nature .
thus far , there are nine of them and their popularity is growing . at first glance the elm , east of the german city of hanover , looks like an ordinary forest .
ingrid ehrlichmann used to go for walks here with her husband . today she 's visiting his grave , which is located at the foot of a tree .
two months ago , ehrlichmann had her husband 's urn buried here .
she believes it 's the perfect spot . " the advantage is that there are no subsequent costs and i do n't have to tend the grave .
i can go on holiday without having to ask someone to water the flowers , " ehrlichmann said .
" i plan to leave this village .
so when i do move , i 'll leave my husband behind in a ' neutral ' place which is right for him . " freer , less confining burial place indeed , woodland cemeteries are less costly than conventional cemeteries . in germany , more people than ever before are choosing to be buried anonymously because relatives are often unable or unwilling to maintain graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , gravesites are leased for a period of 20 to 30 years .
when that time is up , the family of the dead either has to renew the lease - and keep paying - or the plot is freed up for a new inhabitant .
the family has to pay for the cost of removing the body and headstone . other options gaining in popularity in germany are the headstone-free , " anonymous " gravesites in regular cemeteries , which are less expensive and come with less responsibility than a normal plot . in all nine of germany 's woodland cemeteries , there are no flowers or gravestones to serve as reminders of those who lie buried here .
still , ingrid ehrlichmann considers it a very personal spot . " we chose this place with great care , " she said .
" we can recognize the tree by the number on it , but we 'd know it even without that .
i can identify with the tree .
i know the spot where the urn lies and that 's important to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of usedom there are plans for another woodland cemetery on usedom , an island in the baltic sea .
usedom resident dieter schön said he would prefer his final resting place to be in a forest rather than under a slab of granite . " the idea of being covered by something heavy does n't much appeal to me .
i have the feeling that everything here in the woods is somewhat freer , less confining , not so cumbersome .
that 's why it 's the best solution for me . " church up in arms still , the idea of establishing a woodland cemetery on usedom has met with resistance . " i would n't be allowed to lay any flowers at this woodland cemetery , not even a plant or a stone , said usedom resident annelie schallock .
" so how am i supposed to remember those buried there with love and joy ? " germany 's catholic church too believes that woodland cemeteries are leading to the erosion of the meaning behind a christian burial .
the church says maintaining a grave is about more than just pulling up weeds . " tending to a grave is n't a bothersome inconvenience , said andreas scholler , a catholic priest .
he added that it is important for humans to know that they have n't just disappeared after their deaths , but " that someone is still looking after me , caring about me .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have both accepted russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to attend on july 3 . but , beyond the formal festivities and celebrity shoulder-rubbing under the motto " our city - 750 years , " the city 's past still remains a contentious issue in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kant statue in kaliningrad one example of that is the city 's most famous son , the german philosopher immanuel kant .
kant was born in the city when it was known as königsberg , the eastern hub of the prussian empire and the seat of the teutonic knights . the city was seized by soviet forces at the end of world war ii and came under moscow 's control in the 1946 potsdam accords . since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , the city and surrounding region of kaliningrad have become a russian exclave , with the main train link running through former soviet republics belarus and lithuania - the latter a nato and eu member . poland , once part of the warsaw pact , but now another nato and eu member , borders the kaliningrad region to the west and south . name change a loaded issue kant 's legacy is visible in several parts of the city .
russian newlyweds traditionally pay their respects to the famous german by visiting his grave after exchanging vows . the university of kaliningrad was also recently renamed after immanuel kant .
the building , which is now undergoing a facelift , will see chancellor schröder and putin unveiling a memorial plaque in the courtyard . but the name change is a politically charged issue on the university campus .
students are divided about the decision to name a russian university after a german . " it 's unnatural to name a russian university after a foreigner .
they really ca n't be serious , " said one .
but , another was more relaxed about the move .
" i 'm not bothered by the fact that kant was a german .
he lived here a long time , which makes him one of us .
he 's a countryman of ours . " uneasy relationship with past the city 's uncertain relationship with its german past is also illustrated in its quest for new symbols to reaffirm its identity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral in kaliningrad for instance , central kaliningrad 's towering new landmark is the russian orthodox cathedral of christ the savior , the second-largest church in russia and is taller than the old german cathedral built when the city was königsberg . cornelius sommer , the german consul general in the city confirmed that there has been criticism of the celebrations planned for the 750th anniversary .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have both accepted russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to attend on july 3 . but , beyond the formal festivities and celebrity shoulder-rubbing under the motto " our city - 750 years , " the city 's past still remains a contentious issue in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kant statue in kaliningrad one example of that is the city 's most famous son , the german philosopher immanuel kant .
kant was born in the city when it was known as königsberg , the eastern hub of the prussian empire and the seat of the teutonic knights . the city was seized by soviet forces at the end of world war ii and came under moscow 's control in the 1946 potsdam accords . since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , the city and surrounding region of kaliningrad have become a russian exclave , with the main train link running through former soviet republics belarus and lithuania - the latter a nato and eu member . poland , once part of the warsaw pact , but now another nato and eu member , borders the kaliningrad region to the west and south . name change a loaded issue kant 's legacy is visible in several parts of the city .
russian newlyweds traditionally pay their respects to the famous german by visiting his grave after exchanging vows . the university of kaliningrad was also recently renamed after immanuel kant .
the building , which is now undergoing a facelift , will see chancellor schröder and putin unveiling a memorial plaque in the courtyard . but the name change is a politically charged issue on the university campus .
students are divided about the decision to name a russian university after a german . " it 's unnatural to name a russian university after a foreigner .
they really ca n't be serious , " said one .
but , another was more relaxed about the move .
" i 'm not bothered by the fact that kant was a german .
he lived here a long time , which makes him one of us .
he 's a countryman of ours . " uneasy relationship with past the city 's uncertain relationship with its german past is also illustrated in its quest for new symbols to reaffirm its identity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral in kaliningrad for instance , central kaliningrad 's towering new landmark is the russian orthodox cathedral of christ the savior , the second-largest church in russia and is taller than the old german cathedral built when the city was königsberg . cornelius sommer , the german consul general in the city confirmed that there has been criticism of the celebrations planned for the 750th anniversary . " i have n't heard any critical voices here in kaliningrad itself , but i have heard such voices in moscow , " said sommer .
" there they 're saying ' what 's there to celebrate ? 750 years : it was the teutonic knights who expelled the native population ' and so on .
' our history , ' they say , ' only begins in 1945 . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lenin statue was removed from the city center it 's a view that 's shared by the communist party .
it 's been some years since a memorial to its ideological hero , lenin , was removed from the city center .
but there are rumors that the monument is to return to victory square after the anniversary celebrations . the party repeatedly underlines kaliningrad 's russian heritage .
" the communist party 's view on the history of the city , its affiliation and future is clear : kaliningrad is russian , was russian and will always be russian , " said alexander pushetshnikov of the communist party . " both german and russian components " at the same time , there 's a resigned acceptance of the city 's history in certain quarters . the local cultural council in kaliningrad has restored three headless statues of bohemian king ottokar , prussian king friedrich and duke albrecht which adorn the western façade of the city 's king 's gate - a remnant of königsberg that escaped relatively unharmed from the ravages of war . bildunterschrift : ships on the river pregel in kaliningrad " today it 's important that we build a new city , " said mikhail andreev , the city 's cultural administration director .
" at the same time we must not forget individual segments of our city history .
the history of kaliningrad and königsberg has both german and russian components . " nowhere is that more evident than among the group of ethnic germans living in the city , almost all of whom arrived during the 1990s from other parts of the former soviet union - particularly kazakhstan and southern russia .
they are seeking to build a bridge between russian residents and germans . " we do n't have any problems here .
we try to familiarize the locals with german traditions , " said one who performs folk dances for a living .

we want to unite people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany germans too quiet about suicide when life becomes worse than death filling the final days with laughter culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.07.2005 finding final peace in the forest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woodlands are increasingly favored as burial spots the one soft spot in germany 's otherwise rigid burial practices are friedwälder , forests especially set aside to allow headstone-free burials in nature .
thus far , there are nine of them and their popularity is growing . at first glance the elm , east of the german city of hanover , looks like an ordinary forest .
ingrid ehrlichmann used to go for walks here with her husband . today she 's visiting his grave , which is located at the foot of a tree .
two months ago , ehrlichmann had her husband 's urn buried here .
she believes it 's the perfect spot . " the advantage is that there are no subsequent costs and i do n't have to tend the grave .
i can go on holiday without having to ask someone to water the flowers , " ehrlichmann said .
" i plan to leave this village .
so when i do move , i 'll leave my husband behind in a ' neutral ' place which is right for him . " freer , less confining burial place indeed , woodland cemeteries are less costly than conventional cemeteries . in germany , more people than ever before are choosing to be buried anonymously because relatives are often unable or unwilling to maintain graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , gravesites are leased for a period of 20 to 30 years .
when that time is up , the family of the dead either has to renew the lease - and keep paying - or the plot is freed up for a new inhabitant .
the family has to pay for the cost of removing the body and headstone . other options gaining in popularity in germany are the headstone-free , " anonymous " gravesites in regular cemeteries , which are less expensive and come with less responsibility than a normal plot . in all nine of germany 's woodland cemeteries , there are no flowers or gravestones to serve as reminders of those who lie buried here .
still , ingrid ehrlichmann considers it a very personal spot . " we chose this place with great care , " she said .
" we can recognize the tree by the number on it , but we 'd know it even without that .
i can identify with the tree .
i know the spot where the urn lies and that 's important to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of usedom there are plans for another woodland cemetery on usedom , an island in the baltic sea .
usedom resident dieter schön said he would prefer his final resting place to be in a forest rather than under a slab of granite . " the idea of being covered by something heavy does n't much appeal to me .
i have the feeling that everything here in the woods is somewhat freer , less confining , not so cumbersome .
that 's why it 's the best solution for me . " church up in arms still , the idea of establishing a woodland cemetery on usedom has met with resistance . " i would n't be allowed to lay any flowers at this woodland cemetery , not even a plant or a stone , said usedom resident annelie schallock .
" so how am i supposed to remember those buried there with love and joy ? " germany 's catholic church too believes that woodland cemeteries are leading to the erosion of the meaning behind a christian burial .
the church says maintaining a grave is about more than just pulling up weeds . " tending to a grave is n't a bothersome inconvenience , said andreas scholler , a catholic priest .
he added that it is important for humans to know that they have n't just disappeared after their deaths , but " that someone is still looking after me , caring about me .
i have n't simply vanished , been erased , which is why this really is a very significant part of human life . " residents resist woodland burials it 's primarily nearby residents who are opposed to the planned woodland cemetery .
their reasons are more profane .
they feel that a forest ca n't be both a place of leisure and a burial ground . " it 's uncomfortable for all concerned .
for example , if i was taking a group of children for a walk in the forest , completely unsuspecting , and then ran into some mourners it would be awkward for both groups , " said siegfried nast , who lives on usedom . for other residents , it 's an emotional issue .
they do n't want the forest that they played in as children to become a burial site . resident christel schaumkessel said : " i have a strong affiliation to this corner of the woods , and i 'd be very sad if it became a cemetery .
just like a graveyard , a woodland cemetery is a place of rest , contemplation and mourning .
i do n't want it . " the majority of residents here feel the same way , so should the town council vote against it , dieter schön will have to find another final resting place . florian nusch -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breathing new life into old rites germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition .

for six hours , 21 music acts played as part of the series of concerts to raise awareness about global poverty , especially in africa . the mostly young music fans have crowded around the victory column in berlin 's central tiergarten park on saturday afternoon to watch internationally known acts such as a-ha , crosby stills & nash , roxy music and green day as well as german favorites including wir sind helden , silbermond and herbert grönemeyer . german favorites die toten hosen kicked off the concert , electrifying the crowd while reminding the audience that helping africa was the most important part of the event . " this is n't a rock concert .
it 's a demonstration , " campino , the singer from the group , yelled to a jubilant crowd . germans and visitors from around the world packed into the wide boulevard that runs through the downtown park waving banners with the german band 's logo as well as british and argentinian flags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live 8 show in tokyo they and other performers , who each had just about 10 or 15 minutes of stage time , were part of a global concert series on saturday which took in 10 cities and four continents .
the free concerts began with tokyo 's show -lrb- photo -rrb- and with end in venues in north america .
besides berlin and tokyo , the concerts are taking place in london , paris , rome , cornwall in england , philadelphia , barrie in canada , johannesburg and moscow . the shows were the brainchild of british musician amd former frontman of the boomtown rats , bob geldof , who wants to build a critical mass that will pressure leaders of the group of eight major industrialised nations meeting in scotland next week to do more to alleviate poverty , particularly in africa .
goals of the campaign include doubling the amount of aid which goes to africa , relieving the debt of the world 's poorest countries and putting fair trade policies into place to help developing economies . bildunterschrift : irish musician bob geldof , one of the original organizers of live aid concerts in 1985 , poses for the photographers prior to a news conference in london . this series comes 20 years after geldof 's first anti-poverty concert event , live aid .

for six hours , 21 music acts played as part of the series of concerts to raise awareness about global poverty , especially in africa . the mostly young music fans have crowded around the victory column in berlin 's central tiergarten park on saturday afternoon to watch internationally known acts such as a-ha , crosby stills & nash , roxy music and green day as well as german favorites including wir sind helden , silbermond and herbert grönemeyer . german favorites die toten hosen kicked off the concert , electrifying the crowd while reminding the audience that helping africa was the most important part of the event . " this is n't a rock concert .
it 's a demonstration , " campino , the singer from the group , yelled to a jubilant crowd . germans and visitors from around the world packed into the wide boulevard that runs through the downtown park waving banners with the german band 's logo as well as british and argentinian flags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live 8 show in tokyo they and other performers , who each had just about 10 or 15 minutes of stage time , were part of a global concert series on saturday which took in 10 cities and four continents .
the free concerts began with tokyo 's show -lrb- photo -rrb- and with end in venues in north america .
besides berlin and tokyo , the concerts are taking place in london , paris , rome , cornwall in england , philadelphia , barrie in canada , johannesburg and moscow . the shows were the brainchild of british musician amd former frontman of the boomtown rats , bob geldof , who wants to build a critical mass that will pressure leaders of the group of eight major industrialised nations meeting in scotland next week to do more to alleviate poverty , particularly in africa .
goals of the campaign include doubling the amount of aid which goes to africa , relieving the debt of the world 's poorest countries and putting fair trade policies into place to help developing economies . bildunterschrift : irish musician bob geldof , one of the original organizers of live aid concerts in 1985 , poses for the photographers prior to a news conference in london . this series comes 20 years after geldof 's first anti-poverty concert event , live aid .
but unlike 1985 , when an estimated 1.5 billion television viewers tuned in to watch live aid and donated over $ 100 million -lrb- 83 million euros -rrb- for ethiopia 's famine victims , organisers hope to use modern technology like the internet and mobile phones to reach an even bigger audience . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model claudia schiffer , singer herbert grönemeyer , actress nina hoss und bishop wolfgang huber , from right to left , in front of the brandenburg gate in berlin on saturday , july 2 , 2005 , before the live 8 concert on saturday before the show in berlin , german celebrities such as grönemeyer and supermodel claudia schiffer showed their support for the campaign to fight global poverty .
at the brandenburg gate , they signed a banner carrying the slogan " your voice against poverty . " criticism in berlin however , the show in berlin came in for blistering criticism from event managers , who lambasted the german parliament and the city for not giving sufficient backing .
in a newspaper interview , marek lieberberg , a veteran event manager who is putting on the show in berlin , accused berlin mayor klaus wowereit , german authorities and businesses of " stinginess , ignorance and wilhelminian absurd bureaucracy " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reichstag building he complained that german companies did not come forward to sponsor the event as firms had in the other cities where concerts are being held . he also criticized lawmakers for not allowing the concert to be held on the plaza next to the reichstag , or parliament building . but on saturday , music lovers seemed little concerned about organizational glitches .
many in the audience carried red balloons or t-shirts that read " make poverty history . "
families were strongly represented and children were often hoisted on fathers ' shoulders so they could at least catch a glimpse of the stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans cheer at the live 8 concert in berlin many of the 150,000 spectators had to watch the bands on giant video screens that had been set up since the location 's space limitations meant that only some 40,000 had a direct view of the stage . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live 8 organizers lash out at berlin apathy the german parliament and the city of berlin brushed back charges friday from the organizers of the german live8 charity concert for africa that they have failed to give sufficient backing to the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.07.2005 kaliningrad struggles with german legacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaliningrad was seized by moscow after world war ii as the russian city of kaliningrad , formerly a prussian enclave called königsberg , celebrates its 750th anniversary over the weekend , residents still have mixed feelings when it comes to accepting the city 's german past . russia 's baltic outpost of kaliningrad , notorious as a hotbed of crime and social problems in recent years , will shed its gritty image over the weekend as it plays host to world leaders during celebrations marking its 750th anniversary .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac have both accepted russian president vladimir putin 's invitation to attend on july 3 . but , beyond the formal festivities and celebrity shoulder-rubbing under the motto " our city - 750 years , " the city 's past still remains a contentious issue in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a kant statue in kaliningrad one example of that is the city 's most famous son , the german philosopher immanuel kant .
kant was born in the city when it was known as königsberg , the eastern hub of the prussian empire and the seat of the teutonic knights . the city was seized by soviet forces at the end of world war ii and came under moscow 's control in the 1946 potsdam accords . since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , the city and surrounding region of kaliningrad have become a russian exclave , with the main train link running through former soviet republics belarus and lithuania - the latter a nato and eu member . poland , once part of the warsaw pact , but now another nato and eu member , borders the kaliningrad region to the west and south . name change a loaded issue kant 's legacy is visible in several parts of the city .
russian newlyweds traditionally pay their respects to the famous german by visiting his grave after exchanging vows . the university of kaliningrad was also recently renamed after immanuel kant .
the building , which is now undergoing a facelift , will see chancellor schröder and putin unveiling a memorial plaque in the courtyard . but the name change is a politically charged issue on the university campus .
students are divided about the decision to name a russian university after a german . " it 's unnatural to name a russian university after a foreigner .
they really ca n't be serious , " said one .
but , another was more relaxed about the move .
" i 'm not bothered by the fact that kant was a german .
he lived here a long time , which makes him one of us .
he 's a countryman of ours . " uneasy relationship with past the city 's uncertain relationship with its german past is also illustrated in its quest for new symbols to reaffirm its identity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral in kaliningrad for instance , central kaliningrad 's towering new landmark is the russian orthodox cathedral of christ the savior , the second-largest church in russia and is taller than the old german cathedral built when the city was königsberg . cornelius sommer , the german consul general in the city confirmed that there has been criticism of the celebrations planned for the 750th anniversary . " i have n't heard any critical voices here in kaliningrad itself , but i have heard such voices in moscow , " said sommer .
" there they 're saying ' what 's there to celebrate ? 750 years : it was the teutonic knights who expelled the native population ' and so on .
' our history , ' they say , ' only begins in 1945 . " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lenin statue was removed from the city center it 's a view that 's shared by the communist party .
it 's been some years since a memorial to its ideological hero , lenin , was removed from the city center .
but there are rumors that the monument is to return to victory square after the anniversary celebrations . the party repeatedly underlines kaliningrad 's russian heritage .
" the communist party 's view on the history of the city , its affiliation and future is clear : kaliningrad is russian , was russian and will always be russian , " said alexander pushetshnikov of the communist party . " both german and russian components " at the same time , there 's a resigned acceptance of the city 's history in certain quarters . the local cultural council in kaliningrad has restored three headless statues of bohemian king ottokar , prussian king friedrich and duke albrecht which adorn the western façade of the city 's king 's gate - a remnant of königsberg that escaped relatively unharmed from the ravages of war . bildunterschrift : ships on the river pregel in kaliningrad " today it 's important that we build a new city , " said mikhail andreev , the city 's cultural administration director .
" at the same time we must not forget individual segments of our city history .
the history of kaliningrad and königsberg has both german and russian components . " nowhere is that more evident than among the group of ethnic germans living in the city , almost all of whom arrived during the 1990s from other parts of the former soviet union - particularly kazakhstan and southern russia .
they are seeking to build a bridge between russian residents and germans . " we do n't have any problems here .
we try to familiarize the locals with german traditions , " said one who performs folk dances for a living .

we want to unite people .

thus far , there are nine of them and their popularity is growing . at first glance the elm , east of the german city of hanover , looks like an ordinary forest .
ingrid ehrlichmann used to go for walks here with her husband . today she 's visiting his grave , which is located at the foot of a tree .
two months ago , ehrlichmann had her husband 's urn buried here .
she believes it 's the perfect spot . " the advantage is that there are no subsequent costs and i do n't have to tend the grave .
i can go on holiday without having to ask someone to water the flowers , " ehrlichmann said .
" i plan to leave this village .
so when i do move , i 'll leave my husband behind in a ' neutral ' place which is right for him . " freer , less confining burial place indeed , woodland cemeteries are less costly than conventional cemeteries . in germany , more people than ever before are choosing to be buried anonymously because relatives are often unable or unwilling to maintain graves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , gravesites are leased for a period of 20 to 30 years .
when that time is up , the family of the dead either has to renew the lease - and keep paying - or the plot is freed up for a new inhabitant .
the family has to pay for the cost of removing the body and headstone . other options gaining in popularity in germany are the headstone-free , " anonymous " gravesites in regular cemeteries , which are less expensive and come with less responsibility than a normal plot . in all nine of germany 's woodland cemeteries , there are no flowers or gravestones to serve as reminders of those who lie buried here .
still , ingrid ehrlichmann considers it a very personal spot . " we chose this place with great care , " she said .
" we can recognize the tree by the number on it , but we 'd know it even without that .
i can identify with the tree .
i know the spot where the urn lies and that 's important to me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island of usedom there are plans for another woodland cemetery on usedom , an island in the baltic sea .
usedom resident dieter schön said he would prefer his final resting place to be in a forest rather than under a slab of granite . " the idea of being covered by something heavy does n't much appeal to me .
i have the feeling that everything here in the woods is somewhat freer , less confining , not so cumbersome .
that 's why it 's the best solution for me . " church up in arms still , the idea of establishing a woodland cemetery on usedom has met with resistance . " i would n't be allowed to lay any flowers at this woodland cemetery , not even a plant or a stone , said usedom resident annelie schallock .
" so how am i supposed to remember those buried there with love and joy ? " germany 's catholic church too believes that woodland cemeteries are leading to the erosion of the meaning behind a christian burial .
the church says maintaining a grave is about more than just pulling up weeds . " tending to a grave is n't a bothersome inconvenience , said andreas scholler , a catholic priest .
he added that it is important for humans to know that they have n't just disappeared after their deaths , but " that someone is still looking after me , caring about me .
i have n't simply vanished , been erased , which is why this really is a very significant part of human life . " residents resist woodland burials it 's primarily nearby residents who are opposed to the planned woodland cemetery .
their reasons are more profane .
they feel that a forest ca n't be both a place of leisure and a burial ground . " it 's uncomfortable for all concerned .
for example , if i was taking a group of children for a walk in the forest , completely unsuspecting , and then ran into some mourners it would be awkward for both groups , " said siegfried nast , who lives on usedom . for other residents , it 's an emotional issue .
they do n't want the forest that they played in as children to become a burial site . resident christel schaumkessel said : " i have a strong affiliation to this corner of the woods , and i 'd be very sad if it became a cemetery .
just like a graveyard , a woodland cemetery is a place of rest , contemplation and mourning .
i do n't want it . " the majority of residents here feel the same way , so should the town council vote against it , dieter schön will have to find another final resting place . florian nusch -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breathing new life into old rites germany remains one of the few countries in europe which operates a system of enforced cemetery burials , but there is a growing sense among civilians that the time has come to breathe new life into an old tradition .

" uneasy relationship with past the city 's uncertain relationship with its german past is also illustrated in its quest for new symbols to reaffirm its identity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral in kaliningrad for instance , central kaliningrad 's towering new landmark is the russian orthodox cathedral of christ the savior , the second-largest church in russia and is taller than the old german cathedral built when the city was königsberg . cornelius sommer , the german consul general in the city confirmed that there has been criticism of the celebrations planned for the 750th anniversary . " i have n't heard any critical voices here in kaliningrad itself , but i have heard such voices in moscow , " said sommer .
" there they 're saying ' what 's there to celebrate ? 750 years : it was the teutonic knights who expelled the native population ' and so on .

" both german and russian components " at the same time , there 's a resigned acceptance of the city 's history in certain quarters . the local cultural council in kaliningrad has restored three headless statues of bohemian king ottokar , prussian king friedrich and duke albrecht which adorn the western façade of the city 's king 's gate - a remnant of königsberg that escaped relatively unharmed from the ravages of war . bildunterschrift : ships on the river pregel in kaliningrad " today it 's important that we build a new city , " said mikhail andreev , the city 's cultural administration director .
" at the same time we must not forget individual segments of our city history .
the history of kaliningrad and königsberg has both german and russian components . " nowhere is that more evident than among the group of ethnic germans living in the city , almost all of whom arrived during the 1990s from other parts of the former soviet union - particularly kazakhstan and southern russia .
they are seeking to build a bridge between russian residents and germans . " we do n't have any problems here .

in a statement on the matt striker website , he expressed deep remorse over the events , and said he had not realised sick days and personal days " were two entirely different things " .
he said he was willing to pay back the money he owed , and hoped he might get his job back , insisting that his students received excellent teaching from him .
" look at the facts , god gave me gifts and i choose to use them to touch people 's lives , " he said , according to the statement .
" i choose to make the world better by entertainment and education . "
schools special investigator richard condon has recommended mr kaye should not be reemployed , the associated press reported .

plans to redevelop bridlington 's 13th century harbour have already proved to be a bone of contention with locals who opposed the scheme .
proposals have also been put forward to give chapel street , the bustling centre of the resort , a new look .
it is hoped the work would attract more tourists and investors to the area .
there are three sides to bridlington : the traditional fishing harbour , the seafront with tourist attractions and the quaint old town .
plans for a 500-berth marina were submitted by east riding council but were turned down by government officials in august 2003 over concerns that the " adverse impact on both the natural and man-made heritage of bridlington presented a compelling case against allowing it to go ahead . "
but harbour commissioners say they would back plans for a 100-berth marina with fishing facilities .
since then new plans have been submitted by the harbour commissioners and a feasibility study launched , causing a row to break out between the council and the harbour board .
martyn coltman , vice-chairman of the regeneration partnership and chairman of bridlington urban renaissance , said : " around 95 % of people in this resort are in favour of the marina and understand what it could mean for the town - new jobs , additional investment and the start of regeneration here .
" the regeneration partnership is completely behind the plans and we want them to go ahead , " he said .
however , one fisherman , known locally as gill , said he did not agree with the marina plans .
" we keep being told there has been a public consultation on the plans but no-one has consulted us .
" they do not seem to realise that the scheme is not workable as it effectively blocks the harbour in .
if we were consulted and our views taken into consideration then it would be another matter . "
elsewhere in the resort there are plans to revamp chapel street . "
this is n't a case of if it will happen , it is a case of when it happens " martyn coltman considered to be the shopping heart of bridlington , lined with cafes and retail units , the road will become a tree-lined street .
mr coltman said the regeneration partnership had been working with dutch architects on the first phase of the scheme which will be completed early next year .
" the rest of the project will kick-in in about five or six years time with derelict buildings being replaced with new , and dilapidated sites being given a new lease of life , " he said .
" the town centre was designed about 50 years ago so it really needs updating .
instead of a piecemeal approach we are doing it holistically - by 2016 everything will have changed .
" this is n't a case of if it will happen , it is a case of when it happens . "
' high priority ' parks and open green spaces are set to get a revamp to make them areas that people want to visit .
additional transport links and parking facilities are also high on the regeneration agenda .
mr coltman added : " transport improvement is a high priority and we have a £ 5m scheme in place .
" better parking facilities , including a multi-storey , improved public access and park-and-ride scheme are all on the cards . "
bridlington first became a holiday resort in the 19th century when visitors started to bath at bridlington quay .
the regeneration partnership hopes the improvements it makes will ensure bridlington remains a top choice for some for centuries to come .

plans to redevelop bridlington 's 13th century harbour have already proved to be a bone of contention with locals who opposed the scheme .
proposals have also been put forward to give chapel street , the bustling centre of the resort , a new look .
it is hoped the work would attract more tourists and investors to the area .
there are three sides to bridlington : the traditional fishing harbour , the seafront with tourist attractions and the quaint old town .
plans for a 500-berth marina were submitted by east riding council but were turned down by government officials in august 2003 over concerns that the " adverse impact on both the natural and man-made heritage of bridlington presented a compelling case against allowing it to go ahead . "
but harbour commissioners say they would back plans for a 100-berth marina with fishing facilities .
bridlington has won many blue flag awards for its beaches since then new plans have been submitted by the harbour commissioners and a feasibility study launched , causing a row to break out between the council and the harbour board .
martyn coltman , vice-chairman of the regeneration partnership and chairman of bridlington urban renaissance , said : " around 95 % of people in this resort are in favour of the marina and understand what it could mean for the town - new jobs , additional investment and the start of regeneration here .
" the regeneration partnership is completely behind the plans and we want them to go ahead , " he said .
however , one fisherman , known locally as gill , said he did not agree with the marina plans .
" we keep being told there has been a public consultation on the plans but no-one has consulted us .
" they do not seem to realise that the scheme is not workable as it effectively blocks the harbour in .
if we were consulted and our views taken into consideration then it would be another matter . "
elsewhere in the resort there are plans to revamp chapel street .
this is n't a case of if it will happen , it is a case of when it happens martyn coltman considered to be the shopping heart of bridlington , lined with cafes and retail units , the road will become a tree-lined street .
mr coltman said the regeneration partnership had been working with dutch architects on the first phase of the scheme which will be completed early next year .
" the rest of the project will kick-in in about five or six years time with derelict buildings being replaced with new , and dilapidated sites being given a new lease of life , " he said .
" the town centre was designed about 50 years ago so it really needs updating .
instead of a piecemeal approach we are doing it holistically - by 2016 everything will have changed .
" this is n't a case of if it will happen , it is a case of when it happens . "
' high priority ' parks and open green spaces are set to get a revamp to make them areas that people want to visit .
additional transport links and parking facilities are also high on the regeneration agenda .
mr coltman added : " transport improvement is a high priority and we have a £ 5m scheme in place .
" better parking facilities , including a multi-storey , improved public access and park-and-ride scheme are all on the cards . "
bridlington first became a holiday resort in the 19th century when visitors started to bath at bridlington quay .
the regeneration partnership hopes the improvements it makes will ensure bridlington remains a top choice for some for centuries to come .

plans for a 500-berth marina were submitted by east riding council but were turned down by government officials in august 2003 over concerns that the " adverse impact on both the natural and man-made heritage of bridlington presented a compelling case against allowing it to go ahead . "
but harbour commissioners say they would back plans for a 100-berth marina with fishing facilities .
bridlington has won many blue flag awards for its beaches since then new plans have been submitted by the harbour commissioners and a feasibility study launched , causing a row to break out between the council and the harbour board .
martyn coltman , vice-chairman of the regeneration partnership and chairman of bridlington urban renaissance , said : " around 95 % of people in this resort are in favour of the marina and understand what it could mean for the town - new jobs , additional investment and the start of regeneration here .
" the regeneration partnership is completely behind the plans and we want them to go ahead , " he said .
however , one fisherman , known locally as gill , said he did not agree with the marina plans .
" we keep being told there has been a public consultation on the plans but no-one has consulted us .
" they do not seem to realise that the scheme is not workable as it effectively blocks the harbour in .
if we were consulted and our views taken into consideration then it would be another matter . "
elsewhere in the resort there are plans to revamp chapel street .
this is n't a case of if it will happen , it is a case of when it happens martyn coltman considered to be the shopping heart of bridlington , lined with cafes and retail units , the road will become a tree-lined street .
mr coltman said the regeneration partnership had been working with dutch architects on the first phase of the scheme which will be completed early next year .
" the rest of the project will kick-in in about five or six years time with derelict buildings being replaced with new , and dilapidated sites being given a new lease of life , " he said .
" the town centre was designed about 50 years ago so it really needs updating .
instead of a piecemeal approach we are doing it holistically - by 2016 everything will have changed .
" this is n't a case of if it will happen , it is a case of when it happens . "
' high priority ' parks and open green spaces are set to get a revamp to make them areas that people want to visit .
additional transport links and parking facilities are also high on the regeneration agenda .
mr coltman added : " transport improvement is a high priority and we have a £ 5m scheme in place .
" better parking facilities , including a multi-storey , improved public access and park-and-ride scheme are all on the cards . "
bridlington first became a holiday resort in the 19th century when visitors started to bath at bridlington quay .
the regeneration partnership hopes the improvements it makes will ensure bridlington remains a top choice for some for centuries to come .

plans to redevelop bridlington 's 13th century harbour have already proved to be a bone of contention with locals who opposed the scheme .
proposals have also been put forward to give chapel street , the bustling centre of the resort , a new look .
it is hoped the work would attract more tourists and investors to the area .
there are three sides to bridlington : the traditional fishing harbour , the seafront with tourist attractions and the quaint old town .
plans for a 500-berth marina were submitted by east riding council but were turned down by government officials in august 2003 over concerns that the " adverse impact on both the natural and man-made heritage of bridlington presented a compelling case against allowing it to go ahead . "
but harbour commissioners say they would back plans for a 100-berth marina with fishing facilities .
bridlington has won many blue flag awards for its beaches since then new plans have been submitted by the harbour commissioners and a feasibility study launched , causing a row to break out between the council and the harbour board .
martyn coltman , vice-chairman of the regeneration partnership and chairman of bridlington urban renaissance , said : " around 95 % of people in this resort are in favour of the marina and understand what it could mean for the town - new jobs , additional investment and the start of regeneration here .
" the regeneration partnership is completely behind the plans and we want them to go ahead , " he said .
however , one fisherman , known locally as gill , said he did not agree with the marina plans .
" we keep being told there has been a public consultation on the plans but no-one has consulted us .
" they do not seem to realise that the scheme is not workable as it effectively blocks the harbour in .
if we were consulted and our views taken into consideration then it would be another matter . "

ex-soldier arthur robinson , who is 91 , will win £ 3,000 at the 6/1 odds given by william hill bookmakers if he passes away by 6 december 2005 .
he has calculated that is how much his estate would have to pay if he dies before the end of the year .
mr robinson , from crediton , said he regarded the bet as " a bit of a joke " .
if he wins , it 's his funeral .
graham sharpe , william hill mr robinson , who is married to cynthia , 85 , said he did not think the bet was morbid .
he said : " i had asked an insurance broker to get a quotation to cover the £ 3,000 if i died and he wanted £ 1,300 which i thought was ridiculous so i decided to go for the bet . "
william hill spokesman graham sharpe said that this was the first time that the bookmakers had accepted a bet on someone 's own life .
he said : " we have had requests from people wanting to back themselves or , in one case , their wife , to die by a certain date .
" we have even taken bets from people who think everyone in the world will die on a certain date .
" however , when arthur contacted us and explained the circumstances surrounding his wager , we were so impressed at his ingenuity in solving his taxing problem that we decided to lay him the bet - after all , if he wins , it 's his funeral .
" it was , though , slightly tricky to calculate the likelihood that arthur would not be around by 6 december but we took into account his age and general health and both we and he were happy with the 6/1 we came up with . "

the company is the latest to take advantage of a tax loophole which means it can sell products by mail-order without vat .
it hopes to have the warehouse up and running by christmas , and also plans to open a store in the spring .
spokesman gennaro castaldo said it was good news for the island .
' important support ' he said : " there are a number of other operators , large supermarkets for example , who have been based there for quite some time .
" we resisted that for as long as we could but we realised that if we were to try to compete on the same level playing field then we would have to try to get the benefit and that advantage as well " that is only one aspect of it , the support businesses get in guernsey is equally important . "
under european law , retailers that operate outside the eu can sell products valued at less than £ 18 to customers in member states without charging vat .
during a parliamentary debate in february it was stated that the treasury is currently losing £ 80m a year from retailers operating " offshore " and that could soon reach £ 200m a year .
last week jersey 's government said it may close the loophole .
senator frank walker , president of the island 's policy committee , said the loophole was unwelcome and damaging .

vattenfall , a swedish company , which owns mines and power stations in germany , plans to start construction next year .
" we believe coal has a future , " says markus sauthoff , who is leading the project .
" but this is linked to the carbon-dioxide trading system . "
" it 's likely that there will be quite ambitious emission reduction targets in the future , and that the price of co2 trading certificates will be quite high , as a kind of penalty for the use of fossil fuels in power plants , " he says .
" so we need to try to reduce our co2 emissions . "
pilot project mr sauthoff admits that " carbon-dioxide free " is something of a misnomer .
burning coal inevitably produces carbon dioxide .
the idea is to capture the carbon dioxide before it is released into the atmosphere and then store it in a safe place .
the technology now being developed by vattenfall is designed primarily for use with lignite , or brown coal , which is one of eastern germany 's primary mineral resources .
its use in power stations has long been controversial , because of the high level of carbon dioxide it emits in comparison with other fossil fuels .
vattenfall is to build its new plant at schwarze pumpe , south-east of berlin in the state of brandenburg , where it already operates a conventional coal-fired power station .
the new plant will use what vattenfall is calling the oxyfuel process .
" in a conventional power plant we burn lignite in air , which is about 75 % nitrogen , " explains markus sauthoff .
" but in the oxyfuel process we extract the nitrogen and burn the coal in almost pure oxygen combined with some of the flue gases , which are re-circulated into the furnace . "
" today we 're testing single components of this at the university level but to stick all the different parts together and to try to operate them in the most effective way will be the task of the pilot plant . "
climate issues oxyfuel is not the only method of capturing co2 that 's currently being investigated .
there is another so-called " pre-combustion " method , which involves turning the coal into gas before it is burned , and then producing hydrogen that can be used in fuel cells .
a " post-combustion " method involves the chemical " scrubbing " of the gases produced by burning coal , to extract the carbon dioxide .
markus sauthoff admits that it is not yet clear which method will prove to be the most efficient and economically viable .
" but vattenfall does believe that oxyfuel will be the most favourable and this is why we 've decided to build the pilot plant , " he says .
the company has come in for criticism from environmental groups for its continued investment in fossil fuels .
gabriela von goerne , a climate campaigner for greenpeace germany says : " i do n't think vattenfall is taking climate issues seriously . "
" they want to move on with coal technology , which ultimately is a dead end .
the best choice would be to concentrate on renewable energies and put renewable energies in the energy mix of vattenfall . "
vattenfall says it plans to have the 40m-euro plant in operation by 2008 .

burning coal inevitably produces carbon dioxide .
the idea is to capture the carbon dioxide before it is released into the atmosphere and then store it in a safe place .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- should abortion laws change ?
home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : saturday , 2 july , 2005 , 11:06 gmt 12:06 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version should abortion laws change ?
do you think the upper limit for abortion should be lowered ?
doctors at the british medical association conference have voted against reducing the upper limit for abortion from 24 to 20 weeks .
some politicians and medics have questioned the current time limit as medical advances have boosted the survival chances of premature babies .
what do you think of the vote against reducing the limit ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable caroline , se london i agree with the bma 's decision not to endorse reducing the abortion limit , as most of these abortions are only carried out due to severe foetus abnormality anyway .
a lot of men who have commented on this issue seem to endorse serious restrictions on abortions in general .
women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable , a friend of mine had two negative home tests before a doctor confirmed she was three months pregnant .
why force women who want an abortion to have children ?
we should respect women who do not feel that they are ready or able to have children , not make them guilty .
caroline , se london why is it okay for a woman to choose to abort a baby that could survive outside the womb , but the act of terminating a baby 's life becomes murder the second it is born ?
it might make a whole difference to the mother , the only difference to the child is the environment he is growing in .
i completely sympathise with parents who find themselves having to decide to terminate a pregnancy at a late stage due to medical reasons .
just as it is in france , the law should differentiate abortions for personal reasons -lrb- and 12-14 weeks seem reasonable -rrb- and medical abortions where no date limits should be imposed as in these cases , it is likely the baby would not survive anyway .
lauren , sussex the woman is not the most important person to consider in all this and you do n't have to be a man to recognise that .
science has conclusively demonstrated that a 20 week old foetus is a living , sentient human being and its right to life is therefore paramount .
to suggest otherwise flies in the face of reason and ethics .
clive copus , london , england i had an abortion at just over 20 weeks .
it was a hugely difficult decision that i did not make lightly .
i was , for a long time fully unaware i was pregnant due to a lack of periods , and only had a few weeks to make my choice .
in the end i could not bring a -lrb- much wanted -rrb- child into the relationship that i was in ; which was emotionally and physically abusive .
i still feel that i made the right choice ; i am still battling with the scars and i had no right to inflict that on a child .
i do n't feel i did the wrong thing .
but i do wonder what could have been if i had been with the right person .
by all means reduce the upper limit .
but unless you have experienced this , please , refrain from piety and preaching .
i do n't think any woman goes through this lightly - no matter how she may try to react on the surface .
anon there is a principle here : it must be wrong to abort a baby who can survive , and not only survive , but be healthy .
my son was born very prematurely and is entirely healthy .
in a few years 20 week babies will survive -lrb- and be healthy -rrb- , so the limit should be about 18 weeks .
df , london the current limit is fine as it is .
abortion is never an easy option .
however , what should be changed is that the father should be able to have a say in the decision .
anthony , london , uk where a child could be born normally with no abnormalities , abortion should be done only to protect the health of the mother .
if a child is simply unwanted , there are plenty of childless couples out there who would love the chance to adopt .
david , cornwall , uk at 20 weeks we found that our baby had severe abnormalities , but chose to continue the pregnancy .
two weeks later -lrb- last weekend -rrb- he passed away , i was induced and delivered him .
it was a terrible ordeal , but worth it just to be able to hold him , look him in the eye and tell him that we loved him and had done everything we could to help him live .
i could n't have done that if i 'd chosen a termination .
anon , uk i am about to qualify as a midwife and i feel the safety and rights of women are paramount .
i am reassured that the law has not changed .
if it is made harder to obtain an abortion , inevitably there will be a ' black market ' which will provide these procedures , either in this country or abroad .
the foetus has no legal rights in the uk and i consider that important .
otherwise women become perceived as vessels for their unborn child and might be prosecuted for damage done to the foetus .
this in my mind is not acceptable .
sally harborow , brighton , uk one of the most common arguments is that of " it 's plenty of time for a woman to realize she 's pregnant " which is clearly untrue , just by reading the comments !
medications that mess with menstruation cycles , even how the foetus is positioned can make a pregnancy undetectable .
what then ?
be penalized because you truly did not know ?
glynnis baker , pa , usa as a mother i find it repugnant that people consider that it would be acceptable for a woman to experience the third trimester of pregnancy and the process of giving birth against their will , on the premise that a percentage of children born before 24 weeks survive .
what a cruel , mentally destructive and terrifying experience that would be .
dawn , kettering , england suggest a debate this topic was suggested by carrie ricketts , uk : while i can sympathise with the beliefs of those who disagree with abortion on principle , i struggle to understand those who want to reduce the limit to 20 weeks send us your suggestions for have your say debates i gave birth in december last year .
a shortage of appointments meant that i did n't get my " 20 week scan " until almost 24 weeks .
had my baby had a severe disability , my husband and i would have had just one day to decide whether we wanted a termination .
i agree in principle with reducing the time limit , but the ante-natal screening programme in this country needs significant improvement first .
rachel , west yorkshire i had an abortion at 21 weeks .
i had been very ill for several months and my periods had been stopped for 8 months .
i only found out i was pregnant at 20 weeks .
to all those people on here saying that 5 months is too much time to decide - try making that awful decision in 5 days .
i do n't regret the decision i made , i was not in a position then to look after my child .
anon , uk just because you have to agonise over the decision does not make it morally acceptable to terminate the life of a child - even one still in its mother 's womb .
and since when have men 's views on this issue not counted ?
clive copus , london , england people should not be forced to have babies that they do not want .
dave , essex what about the child 's right to life ?
helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .
i went into premature labour and had my daughter at 21 weeks gestation .
she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .
every woman should have the right if they so choose for whatever reason to have an abortion .
it 's not something that you take lightly and i had a week of misery and mental torture when i was trying to make a decision .
marie , berkhamsted , herts it 's interesting how everyone talks in weeks - it 's only just hit me that a 24 week old is 6 months old !
especially now , with science this far on , how can we say it 's ok to terminate a 6 month old unborn child ?
it 's also interesting how we see an unborn child as something we can terminate and a newly born child as something so precious we have to risk our lives to save .
the difference between them is just a few months .
kim lavery , belfast another thought .
i have a friend with spina bifida .
in seeking to understand his condition , i once asked if it would have been better if he had been born in recent years so that modern medicine could have helped him .
his observation was that modern medicine would have identified his condition earlier , and he would have been terminated .
likewise , on those that think it better to be aborted than to grow up as an unloved , unwanted child ; ask any one who has done so their view and whether they would have preferred to have been denied the chance to grow up at all ?
bill , gloucester , uk how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
d , england i 'm a neonatal nurse , which means i care for babies that are born prematurely or just need some sort of help before they can go home .
i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .
how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .
i realise everyone should have a choice because all circumstances are different , but i think it should be harder to do .
to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?
d , england i am a sonographer performing scans on mothers / babies .
there appear to be a lot of comments about how unfair it would be to only discover an abnormality at 20 weeks and force the mother to continue with the pregnancy - this is not what the limit is about .
abortion for foetal abnormality is still allowed up to term under present and new legislation - this limit is purely for social rather than medical reasons , and as such i would prefer a limit of 20 weeks .
helen , maidenhead as i scroll down the list of comments i see that most of the opinions come from men .
this is rather interesting as it is not the man who has to go through the procedure of abortion .
gary higgins , liverpool , england many of the comments seem to centre on women " choosing " late abortions .
most women who intend to have an abortion do so early on the pregnancy .
however , the abortions conducted in the 20-24 week period are generally as a result of discovering something is seriously wrong with either mother or foetus .
in these situations , it is rarely the preferred " choice " of the woman , more likely the result of her situation -lrb- ie financial , social and mental -rrb- .
i wholly support the bma in their decision to not reduce the limit .
nia , london i think it would be good to reduce the time limit .
i 'm surprised that doctors , who are lawfully bound to try to save life in this country , voted not to change the law and save some lives that might otherwise be lost .
clive , guildford , uk given that late terms abortions are actually very rare , and most abortions are performed far earlier , why bother lowering the limit ?
it wo n't affect many women , so there 's not really any point .
my personal feelings on abortion are that the foetus is not alive until it 's born .
until then , it 's only able to survive because its mother allows it to , and if she does n't want to , then that 's her choice .
no one should be a mother against her will , and it 's better for a child to never be born than to grow up hated by its mother .
louise , epsom , surrey abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases alan , london , uk the limit should be lower than 24 weeks .
at this stage the foetus is almost fully formed and is viable .
it only has to grow .
to those talking about ' a woman 's right to an abortion ' : abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases .
it should not be regarded as an alternative to contraception .
alan , london , uk yes absolutely .
i believe women have the right to choose but even 20 weeks is too late , unless it 's for medical reasons .
dee , windsor , england many birth defects are not found until 20 week scans when earlier scans are normal .
if a scan is abnormal at 20 weeks with a condition not compatible with life , or at best extremely difficult with maximal intervention , how can you expect someone to then deliver the child at birth knowing they will die or at best have a very slim chance of survival ?
james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .
question : " would you rather have been aborted than be unloved ? "
i think they would all ' choose life ' .
life should always be given a chance , deformed , diseased or unwanted .
as a society we need to give a voice to those without one .
in this case the unborn child .
chris chorlton , cairo , egypt to lucy of newcastle , so you think it is kinder to the ' child ' to abort ... especially if you can not give it what it ' needs ' .
well , mostly it ' needs ' to stay alive !
you are kidding yourself ... pretending that abortion is in the best interests of the child .
mandy phoenix , liverpool sounds entirely reasonable to me , although i do have misgivings about the time and effort put into saving premature babies .
as for the likes of sb from northants , how on earth can the medical profession stay out of the argument if it is they who have to perform the abortions and care for premature babies ?
or do you think doctors and nurses should be compelled to perform or assist in abortions ?
what about their rights to a clear conscience ?
steve , bristol , uk it should become much harder to go for a termination helene frost , newbury , berkshire yes , the limit should be reduced .
it should become much harder to go for a termination .
you never ever get over it , a mistake that i made myself .
helene frost , newbury , berkshire i was n't interested in this debate until i saw a scan of my son -lrb- now two and a half -rrb- at 10 weeks , with head , body and limbs already clearly developing .
i completely fail to understand how anyone can justify not reducing the limit to 10 weeks or even less except in truly exceptional circumstances .
peter drake , cambourne , uk yes the limit should be lowered .
as medical science progresses then the laws and limits need to be addressed .
abortion is not something that i could go through with but it needs to be there as a choice for people .
with the majority of pregnancies being detected so early -lrb- six weeks -rrb- if a pregnancy is unwanted then there is a lot of time to make this decision .
there does , however , always need to be a back up for those people who do find out about severally handicapped babies and undetected pregnancies .
s east , burgess hill it 's a surprisingly sensible decision from the bma regarding an issue that 's extremely difficult , personal and private for the woman concerned .
ken , london , uk i agree with abortion but with advances in medicine if a foetus is capable of living after 20 weeks gestation it should be given every chance .
if unwanted by the mother after she has had every chance of contraception the child should be put up for adoption .
there are plenty offering to take up these children .
dave s , warton , lancs five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision nicholas sammons , washington , dc i am very much pro-choice , but think that time limits on choosing to have an abortion should be stricter rather than looser .
what excuses could someone have for waiting five months to have an abortion ?
unless health hazards or child handicaps become an issue , five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision .
the longer one waits , the more ethically questionable abortions becomes .
waiting five months seems irresponsible .
nicholas sammons , washington , dc whatever is decided , please , keep this debate in medical and legal spheres .
it does not belong in the realm of politics or , much worse , in petty minded religious or ' high-moralistic ' squabbling .
keith , london , uk i had a termination at just under 24 weeks .
it was a very much wanted pregnancy but we found out the baby would have severe handicaps and probably not survive the birth .
we did n't feel it was fair on the baby or us to continue and so ' chose ' one of 2 uneasy options , to terminate .
the whole thing is horrendous and involves giving birth to your baby and living with the guilt and what ifs .
i can not imagine any women would go through that for trivial reasons , and do n't believe doctors would take it lightly .
i did n't ' believe ' in abortion at all before being placed in that position , it 's a totally different thing to take the moral high-ground when you have the luxury of never being in that dreadful position .
j , sheffield the limit should be reduced to 20 weeks given what we know now about the development of a foetus in the womb .
however , this reduction should be coupled with increased access to abortion clinics , making it easier for those who want an abortion to have one , earlier into the pregnancy gw , birmingham such late abortions are extremely rare .
i know a girl who was completely unaware that she was pregnant until 22 weeks .
she has a chronic illness and her medication affected her menstrual cycle , so she did n't even know that she was pregnant .
if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .
if a woman wants an abortion it 's her decision and frankly state , religion and the medical profession should stay out of it .
sp , northants the very fact that doctors see an ethical issue with late-term abortions shows that they consider an unborn child as an independent human life which needs their care .
it is not surprising that pro-abortionists find this an uncomfortable development .
ashley , london i feel strongly that this is n't a political football , it is a serious medico-legal and ethical matter that requires careful debate and not ill-informed sound-bites .
abortions cause great unhappiness , unwanted and unloved children cause even greater unhappiness .
bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .
surely a decision should be made by the parent -lrb- s -rrb- well in advance anyway ?
oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .
emma , leeds i think even 20 weeks is too much to be acceptable .
12 weeks should be the absolute maximum .
lk , london abortions that late in pregnancy are very rare and are not done lightly .
completely banning them is wrong because there are a number of life threatening conditions which are n't apparent until late in the pregnancy .
ian , rochester while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them louisa , sw london i 'm pleased that the bma have shown such good sense .
abortions over 22 weeks were only 1 % of all abortions performed last year .
while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them .
why should we force women to have babies they do n't want ?
despite advances in contraception no-one can make 100 % sure that they wo n't get pregnant without a hysterectomy .
for those who are worried about the overall rise in abortions , restricting late-term abortions will not reduce the overall rate .
louisa , sw london my son was born and survived at 24 weeks .
unless there is danger to the mother the limit should be reduced to even less than 20 weeks .
i can not see how a person can carry a child for several months and justify changing her mind at the last minute .
m grant , dundee abortion time limits should only be reduced to 20 weeks if a more detailed scan is offered earlier in the pregnancy - say at around 14 weeks - so that should there be anything wrong the baby , parents have the time to look into the disability and decide if they are able to continue with the pregnancy .
there should also be exceptions to the rule in extreme cases such as pregnancy after rape or if continuation of pregnancy causes the mother serious medical problems .
jc , oxford while i can see the argument for reducing the upper limit , it 's important to remember that it 's not premature babies with a chance of survival that are being aborted post 20 weeks .
as i understand it , the majority of abortions this late in pregnancy are as a result of foetal abnormality that is so severe the baby would n't live anyway .
jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .
in fact i say lower it to 18 weeks .
any woman considering an abortion has plenty of time to decide in four months .
it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .

do you think the upper limit for abortion should be lowered ?
doctors at the british medical association conference have voted against reducing the upper limit for abortion from 24 to 20 weeks .
some politicians and medics have questioned the current time limit as medical advances have boosted the survival chances of premature babies .
what do you think of the vote against reducing the limit ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable caroline , se london i agree with the bma 's decision not to endorse reducing the abortion limit , as most of these abortions are only carried out due to severe foetus abnormality anyway .
a lot of men who have commented on this issue seem to endorse serious restrictions on abortions in general .
women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable , a friend of mine had two negative home tests before a doctor confirmed she was three months pregnant .
why force women who want an abortion to have children ?
we should respect women who do not feel that they are ready or able to have children , not make them guilty .
caroline , se london why is it okay for a woman to choose to abort a baby that could survive outside the womb , but the act of terminating a baby 's life becomes murder the second it is born ?
it might make a whole difference to the mother , the only difference to the child is the environment he is growing in .
i completely sympathise with parents who find themselves having to decide to terminate a pregnancy at a late stage due to medical reasons .
just as it is in france , the law should differentiate abortions for personal reasons -lrb- and 12-14 weeks seem reasonable -rrb- and medical abortions where no date limits should be imposed as in these cases , it is likely the baby would not survive anyway .
lauren , sussex the woman is not the most important person to consider in all this and you do n't have to be a man to recognise that .
science has conclusively demonstrated that a 20 week old foetus is a living , sentient human being and its right to life is therefore paramount .
to suggest otherwise flies in the face of reason and ethics .
clive copus , london , england i had an abortion at just over 20 weeks .
it was a hugely difficult decision that i did not make lightly .
i was , for a long time fully unaware i was pregnant due to a lack of periods , and only had a few weeks to make my choice .
in the end i could not bring a -lrb- much wanted -rrb- child into the relationship that i was in ; which was emotionally and physically abusive .
i still feel that i made the right choice ; i am still battling with the scars and i had no right to inflict that on a child .
i do n't feel i did the wrong thing .
but i do wonder what could have been if i had been with the right person .
by all means reduce the upper limit .
but unless you have experienced this , please , refrain from piety and preaching .
i do n't think any woman goes through this lightly - no matter how she may try to react on the surface .
anon there is a principle here : it must be wrong to abort a baby who can survive , and not only survive , but be healthy .
my son was born very prematurely and is entirely healthy .
in a few years 20 week babies will survive -lrb- and be healthy -rrb- , so the limit should be about 18 weeks .
df , london the current limit is fine as it is .
abortion is never an easy option .
however , what should be changed is that the father should be able to have a say in the decision .
anthony , london , uk where a child could be born normally with no abnormalities , abortion should be done only to protect the health of the mother .
if a child is simply unwanted , there are plenty of childless couples out there who would love the chance to adopt .
david , cornwall , uk at 20 weeks we found that our baby had severe abnormalities , but chose to continue the pregnancy .
two weeks later -lrb- last weekend -rrb- he passed away , i was induced and delivered him .
it was a terrible ordeal , but worth it just to be able to hold him , look him in the eye and tell him that we loved him and had done everything we could to help him live .
i could n't have done that if i 'd chosen a termination .
anon , uk i am about to qualify as a midwife and i feel the safety and rights of women are paramount .
i am reassured that the law has not changed .
if it is made harder to obtain an abortion , inevitably there will be a ' black market ' which will provide these procedures , either in this country or abroad .
the foetus has no legal rights in the uk and i consider that important .
otherwise women become perceived as vessels for their unborn child and might be prosecuted for damage done to the foetus .
this in my mind is not acceptable .
sally harborow , brighton , uk one of the most common arguments is that of " it 's plenty of time for a woman to realize she 's pregnant " which is clearly untrue , just by reading the comments !
medications that mess with menstruation cycles , even how the foetus is positioned can make a pregnancy undetectable .
what then ?
be penalized because you truly did not know ?
glynnis baker , pa , usa as a mother i find it repugnant that people consider that it would be acceptable for a woman to experience the third trimester of pregnancy and the process of giving birth against their will , on the premise that a percentage of children born before 24 weeks survive .
what a cruel , mentally destructive and terrifying experience that would be .
dawn , kettering , england suggest a debate this topic was suggested by carrie ricketts , uk : while i can sympathise with the beliefs of those who disagree with abortion on principle , i struggle to understand those who want to reduce the limit to 20 weeks send us your suggestions for have your say debates i gave birth in december last year .
a shortage of appointments meant that i did n't get my " 20 week scan " until almost 24 weeks .
had my baby had a severe disability , my husband and i would have had just one day to decide whether we wanted a termination .
i agree in principle with reducing the time limit , but the ante-natal screening programme in this country needs significant improvement first .
rachel , west yorkshire i had an abortion at 21 weeks .
i had been very ill for several months and my periods had been stopped for 8 months .
i only found out i was pregnant at 20 weeks .
to all those people on here saying that 5 months is too much time to decide - try making that awful decision in 5 days .
i do n't regret the decision i made , i was not in a position then to look after my child .
anon , uk just because you have to agonise over the decision does not make it morally acceptable to terminate the life of a child - even one still in its mother 's womb .
and since when have men 's views on this issue not counted ?
clive copus , london , england people should not be forced to have babies that they do not want .
dave , essex what about the child 's right to life ?
helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .
i went into premature labour and had my daughter at 21 weeks gestation .
she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .
every woman should have the right if they so choose for whatever reason to have an abortion .
it 's not something that you take lightly and i had a week of misery and mental torture when i was trying to make a decision .
marie , berkhamsted , herts it 's interesting how everyone talks in weeks - it 's only just hit me that a 24 week old is 6 months old !
especially now , with science this far on , how can we say it 's ok to terminate a 6 month old unborn child ?
it 's also interesting how we see an unborn child as something we can terminate and a newly born child as something so precious we have to risk our lives to save .
the difference between them is just a few months .
kim lavery , belfast another thought .
i have a friend with spina bifida .
in seeking to understand his condition , i once asked if it would have been better if he had been born in recent years so that modern medicine could have helped him .
his observation was that modern medicine would have identified his condition earlier , and he would have been terminated .
likewise , on those that think it better to be aborted than to grow up as an unloved , unwanted child ; ask any one who has done so their view and whether they would have preferred to have been denied the chance to grow up at all ?
bill , gloucester , uk how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
d , england i 'm a neonatal nurse , which means i care for babies that are born prematurely or just need some sort of help before they can go home .
i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .
how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .
i realise everyone should have a choice because all circumstances are different , but i think it should be harder to do .
to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?
d , england i am a sonographer performing scans on mothers / babies .
there appear to be a lot of comments about how unfair it would be to only discover an abnormality at 20 weeks and force the mother to continue with the pregnancy - this is not what the limit is about .
abortion for foetal abnormality is still allowed up to term under present and new legislation - this limit is purely for social rather than medical reasons , and as such i would prefer a limit of 20 weeks .
helen , maidenhead as i scroll down the list of comments i see that most of the opinions come from men .
this is rather interesting as it is not the man who has to go through the procedure of abortion .
gary higgins , liverpool , england many of the comments seem to centre on women " choosing " late abortions .
most women who intend to have an abortion do so early on the pregnancy .
however , the abortions conducted in the 20-24 week period are generally as a result of discovering something is seriously wrong with either mother or foetus .
in these situations , it is rarely the preferred " choice " of the woman , more likely the result of her situation -lrb- ie financial , social and mental -rrb- .
i wholly support the bma in their decision to not reduce the limit .
nia , london i think it would be good to reduce the time limit .
i 'm surprised that doctors , who are lawfully bound to try to save life in this country , voted not to change the law and save some lives that might otherwise be lost .
clive , guildford , uk given that late terms abortions are actually very rare , and most abortions are performed far earlier , why bother lowering the limit ?
it wo n't affect many women , so there 's not really any point .
my personal feelings on abortion are that the foetus is not alive until it 's born .
until then , it 's only able to survive because its mother allows it to , and if she does n't want to , then that 's her choice .
no one should be a mother against her will , and it 's better for a child to never be born than to grow up hated by its mother .
louise , epsom , surrey abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases alan , london , uk the limit should be lower than 24 weeks .
at this stage the foetus is almost fully formed and is viable .
it only has to grow .
to those talking about ' a woman 's right to an abortion ' : abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases .
it should not be regarded as an alternative to contraception .
alan , london , uk yes absolutely .
i believe women have the right to choose but even 20 weeks is too late , unless it 's for medical reasons .
dee , windsor , england many birth defects are not found until 20 week scans when earlier scans are normal .
if a scan is abnormal at 20 weeks with a condition not compatible with life , or at best extremely difficult with maximal intervention , how can you expect someone to then deliver the child at birth knowing they will die or at best have a very slim chance of survival ?
james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .
question : " would you rather have been aborted than be unloved ? "
i think they would all ' choose life ' .
life should always be given a chance , deformed , diseased or unwanted .
as a society we need to give a voice to those without one .
in this case the unborn child .
chris chorlton , cairo , egypt to lucy of newcastle , so you think it is kinder to the ' child ' to abort ... especially if you can not give it what it ' needs ' .
well , mostly it ' needs ' to stay alive !
you are kidding yourself ... pretending that abortion is in the best interests of the child .
mandy phoenix , liverpool sounds entirely reasonable to me , although i do have misgivings about the time and effort put into saving premature babies .
as for the likes of sb from northants , how on earth can the medical profession stay out of the argument if it is they who have to perform the abortions and care for premature babies ?
or do you think doctors and nurses should be compelled to perform or assist in abortions ?
what about their rights to a clear conscience ?
steve , bristol , uk it should become much harder to go for a termination helene frost , newbury , berkshire yes , the limit should be reduced .
it should become much harder to go for a termination .
you never ever get over it , a mistake that i made myself .
helene frost , newbury , berkshire i was n't interested in this debate until i saw a scan of my son -lrb- now two and a half -rrb- at 10 weeks , with head , body and limbs already clearly developing .
i completely fail to understand how anyone can justify not reducing the limit to 10 weeks or even less except in truly exceptional circumstances .
peter drake , cambourne , uk yes the limit should be lowered .
as medical science progresses then the laws and limits need to be addressed .
abortion is not something that i could go through with but it needs to be there as a choice for people .
with the majority of pregnancies being detected so early -lrb- six weeks -rrb- if a pregnancy is unwanted then there is a lot of time to make this decision .
there does , however , always need to be a back up for those people who do find out about severally handicapped babies and undetected pregnancies .
s east , burgess hill it 's a surprisingly sensible decision from the bma regarding an issue that 's extremely difficult , personal and private for the woman concerned .
ken , london , uk i agree with abortion but with advances in medicine if a foetus is capable of living after 20 weeks gestation it should be given every chance .
if unwanted by the mother after she has had every chance of contraception the child should be put up for adoption .
there are plenty offering to take up these children .
dave s , warton , lancs five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision nicholas sammons , washington , dc i am very much pro-choice , but think that time limits on choosing to have an abortion should be stricter rather than looser .
what excuses could someone have for waiting five months to have an abortion ?
unless health hazards or child handicaps become an issue , five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision .
the longer one waits , the more ethically questionable abortions becomes .
waiting five months seems irresponsible .
nicholas sammons , washington , dc whatever is decided , please , keep this debate in medical and legal spheres .
it does not belong in the realm of politics or , much worse , in petty minded religious or ' high-moralistic ' squabbling .
keith , london , uk i had a termination at just under 24 weeks .
it was a very much wanted pregnancy but we found out the baby would have severe handicaps and probably not survive the birth .
we did n't feel it was fair on the baby or us to continue and so ' chose ' one of 2 uneasy options , to terminate .
the whole thing is horrendous and involves giving birth to your baby and living with the guilt and what ifs .
i can not imagine any women would go through that for trivial reasons , and do n't believe doctors would take it lightly .
i did n't ' believe ' in abortion at all before being placed in that position , it 's a totally different thing to take the moral high-ground when you have the luxury of never being in that dreadful position .
j , sheffield the limit should be reduced to 20 weeks given what we know now about the development of a foetus in the womb .
however , this reduction should be coupled with increased access to abortion clinics , making it easier for those who want an abortion to have one , earlier into the pregnancy gw , birmingham such late abortions are extremely rare .
i know a girl who was completely unaware that she was pregnant until 22 weeks .
she has a chronic illness and her medication affected her menstrual cycle , so she did n't even know that she was pregnant .
if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .
if a woman wants an abortion it 's her decision and frankly state , religion and the medical profession should stay out of it .
sp , northants the very fact that doctors see an ethical issue with late-term abortions shows that they consider an unborn child as an independent human life which needs their care .

ashley , london i feel strongly that this is n't a political football , it is a serious medico-legal and ethical matter that requires careful debate and not ill-informed sound-bites .
abortions cause great unhappiness , unwanted and unloved children cause even greater unhappiness .
bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .
surely a decision should be made by the parent -lrb- s -rrb- well in advance anyway ?
oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .
emma , leeds i think even 20 weeks is too much to be acceptable .
12 weeks should be the absolute maximum .

jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .
in fact i say lower it to 18 weeks .
any woman considering an abortion has plenty of time to decide in four months .
it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .

women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable , a friend of mine had two negative home tests before a doctor confirmed she was three months pregnant .
why force women who want an abortion to have children ?
we should respect women who do not feel that they are ready or able to have children , not make them guilty .
caroline , se london why is it okay for a woman to choose to abort a baby that could survive outside the womb , but the act of terminating a baby 's life becomes murder the second it is born ?
it might make a whole difference to the mother , the only difference to the child is the environment he is growing in .
i completely sympathise with parents who find themselves having to decide to terminate a pregnancy at a late stage due to medical reasons .
just as it is in france , the law should differentiate abortions for personal reasons -lrb- and 12-14 weeks seem reasonable -rrb- and medical abortions where no date limits should be imposed as in these cases , it is likely the baby would not survive anyway .
lauren , sussex the woman is not the most important person to consider in all this and you do n't have to be a man to recognise that .
science has conclusively demonstrated that a 20 week old foetus is a living , sentient human being and its right to life is therefore paramount .
to suggest otherwise flies in the face of reason and ethics .
clive copus , london , england i had an abortion at just over 20 weeks .
it was a hugely difficult decision that i did not make lightly .
i was , for a long time fully unaware i was pregnant due to a lack of periods , and only had a few weeks to make my choice .
in the end i could not bring a -lrb- much wanted -rrb- child into the relationship that i was in ; which was emotionally and physically abusive .
i still feel that i made the right choice ; i am still battling with the scars and i had no right to inflict that on a child .
i do n't feel i did the wrong thing .
but i do wonder what could have been if i had been with the right person .
by all means reduce the upper limit .
but unless you have experienced this , please , refrain from piety and preaching .
i do n't think any woman goes through this lightly - no matter how she may try to react on the surface .
anon there is a principle here : it must be wrong to abort a baby who can survive , and not only survive , but be healthy .
my son was born very prematurely and is entirely healthy .
in a few years 20 week babies will survive -lrb- and be healthy -rrb- , so the limit should be about 18 weeks .
df , london the current limit is fine as it is .
abortion is never an easy option .
however , what should be changed is that the father should be able to have a say in the decision .
anthony , london , uk where a child could be born normally with no abnormalities , abortion should be done only to protect the health of the mother .
if a child is simply unwanted , there are plenty of childless couples out there who would love the chance to adopt .
david , cornwall , uk at 20 weeks we found that our baby had severe abnormalities , but chose to continue the pregnancy .
two weeks later -lrb- last weekend -rrb- he passed away , i was induced and delivered him .
it was a terrible ordeal , but worth it just to be able to hold him , look him in the eye and tell him that we loved him and had done everything we could to help him live .
i could n't have done that if i 'd chosen a termination .
anon , uk i am about to qualify as a midwife and i feel the safety and rights of women are paramount .
i am reassured that the law has not changed .
if it is made harder to obtain an abortion , inevitably there will be a ' black market ' which will provide these procedures , either in this country or abroad .
the foetus has no legal rights in the uk and i consider that important .
otherwise women become perceived as vessels for their unborn child and might be prosecuted for damage done to the foetus .
this in my mind is not acceptable .
sally harborow , brighton , uk one of the most common arguments is that of " it 's plenty of time for a woman to realize she 's pregnant " which is clearly untrue , just by reading the comments !
medications that mess with menstruation cycles , even how the foetus is positioned can make a pregnancy undetectable .
what then ?
be penalized because you truly did not know ?
glynnis baker , pa , usa as a mother i find it repugnant that people consider that it would be acceptable for a woman to experience the third trimester of pregnancy and the process of giving birth against their will , on the premise that a percentage of children born before 24 weeks survive .
what a cruel , mentally destructive and terrifying experience that would be .
dawn , kettering , england suggest a debate this topic was suggested by carrie ricketts , uk : while i can sympathise with the beliefs of those who disagree with abortion on principle , i struggle to understand those who want to reduce the limit to 20 weeks send us your suggestions for have your say debates i gave birth in december last year .
a shortage of appointments meant that i did n't get my " 20 week scan " until almost 24 weeks .
had my baby had a severe disability , my husband and i would have had just one day to decide whether we wanted a termination .
i agree in principle with reducing the time limit , but the ante-natal screening programme in this country needs significant improvement first .
rachel , west yorkshire i had an abortion at 21 weeks .
i had been very ill for several months and my periods had been stopped for 8 months .
i only found out i was pregnant at 20 weeks .
to all those people on here saying that 5 months is too much time to decide - try making that awful decision in 5 days .
i do n't regret the decision i made , i was not in a position then to look after my child .
anon , uk just because you have to agonise over the decision does not make it morally acceptable to terminate the life of a child - even one still in its mother 's womb .
and since when have men 's views on this issue not counted ?
clive copus , london , england people should not be forced to have babies that they do not want .
dave , essex what about the child 's right to life ?
helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .
i went into premature labour and had my daughter at 21 weeks gestation .
she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .
every woman should have the right if they so choose for whatever reason to have an abortion .
it 's not something that you take lightly and i had a week of misery and mental torture when i was trying to make a decision .
marie , berkhamsted , herts it 's interesting how everyone talks in weeks - it 's only just hit me that a 24 week old is 6 months old !
especially now , with science this far on , how can we say it 's ok to terminate a 6 month old unborn child ?
it 's also interesting how we see an unborn child as something we can terminate and a newly born child as something so precious we have to risk our lives to save .
the difference between them is just a few months .
kim lavery , belfast another thought .
i have a friend with spina bifida .
in seeking to understand his condition , i once asked if it would have been better if he had been born in recent years so that modern medicine could have helped him .
his observation was that modern medicine would have identified his condition earlier , and he would have been terminated .
likewise , on those that think it better to be aborted than to grow up as an unloved , unwanted child ; ask any one who has done so their view and whether they would have preferred to have been denied the chance to grow up at all ?
bill , gloucester , uk how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
d , england i 'm a neonatal nurse , which means i care for babies that are born prematurely or just need some sort of help before they can go home .
i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .
how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .
i realise everyone should have a choice because all circumstances are different , but i think it should be harder to do .
to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?
d , england i am a sonographer performing scans on mothers / babies .
there appear to be a lot of comments about how unfair it would be to only discover an abnormality at 20 weeks and force the mother to continue with the pregnancy - this is not what the limit is about .
abortion for foetal abnormality is still allowed up to term under present and new legislation - this limit is purely for social rather than medical reasons , and as such i would prefer a limit of 20 weeks .
helen , maidenhead as i scroll down the list of comments i see that most of the opinions come from men .
this is rather interesting as it is not the man who has to go through the procedure of abortion .
gary higgins , liverpool , england many of the comments seem to centre on women " choosing " late abortions .
most women who intend to have an abortion do so early on the pregnancy .
however , the abortions conducted in the 20-24 week period are generally as a result of discovering something is seriously wrong with either mother or foetus .
in these situations , it is rarely the preferred " choice " of the woman , more likely the result of her situation -lrb- ie financial , social and mental -rrb- .
i wholly support the bma in their decision to not reduce the limit .
nia , london i think it would be good to reduce the time limit .
i 'm surprised that doctors , who are lawfully bound to try to save life in this country , voted not to change the law and save some lives that might otherwise be lost .
clive , guildford , uk given that late terms abortions are actually very rare , and most abortions are performed far earlier , why bother lowering the limit ?
it wo n't affect many women , so there 's not really any point .
my personal feelings on abortion are that the foetus is not alive until it 's born .
until then , it 's only able to survive because its mother allows it to , and if she does n't want to , then that 's her choice .
no one should be a mother against her will , and it 's better for a child to never be born than to grow up hated by its mother .
louise , epsom , surrey abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases alan , london , uk the limit should be lower than 24 weeks .
at this stage the foetus is almost fully formed and is viable .
it only has to grow .
to those talking about ' a woman 's right to an abortion ' : abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases .
it should not be regarded as an alternative to contraception .
alan , london , uk yes absolutely .
i believe women have the right to choose but even 20 weeks is too late , unless it 's for medical reasons .
dee , windsor , england many birth defects are not found until 20 week scans when earlier scans are normal .
if a scan is abnormal at 20 weeks with a condition not compatible with life , or at best extremely difficult with maximal intervention , how can you expect someone to then deliver the child at birth knowing they will die or at best have a very slim chance of survival ?
james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .
question : " would you rather have been aborted than be unloved ? "
i think they would all ' choose life ' .
life should always be given a chance , deformed , diseased or unwanted .
as a society we need to give a voice to those without one .
in this case the unborn child .
chris chorlton , cairo , egypt to lucy of newcastle , so you think it is kinder to the ' child ' to abort ... especially if you can not give it what it ' needs ' .
well , mostly it ' needs ' to stay alive !
you are kidding yourself ... pretending that abortion is in the best interests of the child .
mandy phoenix , liverpool sounds entirely reasonable to me , although i do have misgivings about the time and effort put into saving premature babies .
as for the likes of sb from northants , how on earth can the medical profession stay out of the argument if it is they who have to perform the abortions and care for premature babies ?
or do you think doctors and nurses should be compelled to perform or assist in abortions ?
what about their rights to a clear conscience ?
steve , bristol , uk it should become much harder to go for a termination helene frost , newbury , berkshire yes , the limit should be reduced .
it should become much harder to go for a termination .
you never ever get over it , a mistake that i made myself .
helene frost , newbury , berkshire i was n't interested in this debate until i saw a scan of my son -lrb- now two and a half -rrb- at 10 weeks , with head , body and limbs already clearly developing .
i completely fail to understand how anyone can justify not reducing the limit to 10 weeks or even less except in truly exceptional circumstances .
peter drake , cambourne , uk yes the limit should be lowered .
as medical science progresses then the laws and limits need to be addressed .
abortion is not something that i could go through with but it needs to be there as a choice for people .
with the majority of pregnancies being detected so early -lrb- six weeks -rrb- if a pregnancy is unwanted then there is a lot of time to make this decision .
there does , however , always need to be a back up for those people who do find out about severally handicapped babies and undetected pregnancies .
s east , burgess hill it 's a surprisingly sensible decision from the bma regarding an issue that 's extremely difficult , personal and private for the woman concerned .
ken , london , uk i agree with abortion but with advances in medicine if a foetus is capable of living after 20 weeks gestation it should be given every chance .
if unwanted by the mother after she has had every chance of contraception the child should be put up for adoption .
there are plenty offering to take up these children .
dave s , warton , lancs five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision nicholas sammons , washington , dc i am very much pro-choice , but think that time limits on choosing to have an abortion should be stricter rather than looser .
what excuses could someone have for waiting five months to have an abortion ?
unless health hazards or child handicaps become an issue , five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision .
the longer one waits , the more ethically questionable abortions becomes .
waiting five months seems irresponsible .
nicholas sammons , washington , dc whatever is decided , please , keep this debate in medical and legal spheres .
it does not belong in the realm of politics or , much worse , in petty minded religious or ' high-moralistic ' squabbling .
keith , london , uk i had a termination at just under 24 weeks .
it was a very much wanted pregnancy but we found out the baby would have severe handicaps and probably not survive the birth .
we did n't feel it was fair on the baby or us to continue and so ' chose ' one of 2 uneasy options , to terminate .
the whole thing is horrendous and involves giving birth to your baby and living with the guilt and what ifs .
i can not imagine any women would go through that for trivial reasons , and do n't believe doctors would take it lightly .
i did n't ' believe ' in abortion at all before being placed in that position , it 's a totally different thing to take the moral high-ground when you have the luxury of never being in that dreadful position .
j , sheffield the limit should be reduced to 20 weeks given what we know now about the development of a foetus in the womb .
however , this reduction should be coupled with increased access to abortion clinics , making it easier for those who want an abortion to have one , earlier into the pregnancy gw , birmingham such late abortions are extremely rare .
i know a girl who was completely unaware that she was pregnant until 22 weeks .
she has a chronic illness and her medication affected her menstrual cycle , so she did n't even know that she was pregnant .
if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .
if a woman wants an abortion it 's her decision and frankly state , religion and the medical profession should stay out of it .
sp , northants the very fact that doctors see an ethical issue with late-term abortions shows that they consider an unborn child as an independent human life which needs their care .
it is not surprising that pro-abortionists find this an uncomfortable development .
ashley , london i feel strongly that this is n't a political football , it is a serious medico-legal and ethical matter that requires careful debate and not ill-informed sound-bites .
abortions cause great unhappiness , unwanted and unloved children cause even greater unhappiness .
bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .
surely a decision should be made by the parent -lrb- s -rrb- well in advance anyway ?
oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .
emma , leeds i think even 20 weeks is too much to be acceptable .
12 weeks should be the absolute maximum .
lk , london abortions that late in pregnancy are very rare and are not done lightly .
completely banning them is wrong because there are a number of life threatening conditions which are n't apparent until late in the pregnancy .
ian , rochester while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them louisa , sw london i 'm pleased that the bma have shown such good sense .
abortions over 22 weeks were only 1 % of all abortions performed last year .
while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them .
why should we force women to have babies they do n't want ?
despite advances in contraception no-one can make 100 % sure that they wo n't get pregnant without a hysterectomy .
for those who are worried about the overall rise in abortions , restricting late-term abortions will not reduce the overall rate .
louisa , sw london my son was born and survived at 24 weeks .
unless there is danger to the mother the limit should be reduced to even less than 20 weeks .
i can not see how a person can carry a child for several months and justify changing her mind at the last minute .
m grant , dundee abortion time limits should only be reduced to 20 weeks if a more detailed scan is offered earlier in the pregnancy - say at around 14 weeks - so that should there be anything wrong the baby , parents have the time to look into the disability and decide if they are able to continue with the pregnancy .
there should also be exceptions to the rule in extreme cases such as pregnancy after rape or if continuation of pregnancy causes the mother serious medical problems .
jc , oxford while i can see the argument for reducing the upper limit , it 's important to remember that it 's not premature babies with a chance of survival that are being aborted post 20 weeks .
as i understand it , the majority of abortions this late in pregnancy are as a result of foetal abnormality that is so severe the baby would n't live anyway .
jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .
in fact i say lower it to 18 weeks .
any woman considering an abortion has plenty of time to decide in four months .
it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .

do you think the upper limit for abortion should be lowered ?
doctors at the british medical association conference have voted against reducing the upper limit for abortion from 24 to 20 weeks .
some politicians and medics have questioned the current time limit as medical advances have boosted the survival chances of premature babies .
what do you think of the vote against reducing the limit ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .

helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .
i went into premature labour and had my daughter at 21 weeks gestation .
she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .
every woman should have the right if they so choose for whatever reason to have an abortion .
it 's not something that you take lightly and i had a week of misery and mental torture when i was trying to make a decision .
marie , berkhamsted , herts it 's interesting how everyone talks in weeks - it 's only just hit me that a 24 week old is 6 months old !
especially now , with science this far on , how can we say it 's ok to terminate a 6 month old unborn child ?
it 's also interesting how we see an unborn child as something we can terminate and a newly born child as something so precious we have to risk our lives to save .
the difference between them is just a few months .
kim lavery , belfast another thought .
i have a friend with spina bifida .
in seeking to understand his condition , i once asked if it would have been better if he had been born in recent years so that modern medicine could have helped him .
his observation was that modern medicine would have identified his condition earlier , and he would have been terminated .
likewise , on those that think it better to be aborted than to grow up as an unloved , unwanted child ; ask any one who has done so their view and whether they would have preferred to have been denied the chance to grow up at all ?
bill , gloucester , uk how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
d , england i 'm a neonatal nurse , which means i care for babies that are born prematurely or just need some sort of help before they can go home .
i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .
how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .
i realise everyone should have a choice because all circumstances are different , but i think it should be harder to do .
to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?
d , england i am a sonographer performing scans on mothers / babies .
there appear to be a lot of comments about how unfair it would be to only discover an abnormality at 20 weeks and force the mother to continue with the pregnancy - this is not what the limit is about .
abortion for foetal abnormality is still allowed up to term under present and new legislation - this limit is purely for social rather than medical reasons , and as such i would prefer a limit of 20 weeks .
helen , maidenhead as i scroll down the list of comments i see that most of the opinions come from men .
this is rather interesting as it is not the man who has to go through the procedure of abortion .
gary higgins , liverpool , england many of the comments seem to centre on women " choosing " late abortions .
most women who intend to have an abortion do so early on the pregnancy .
however , the abortions conducted in the 20-24 week period are generally as a result of discovering something is seriously wrong with either mother or foetus .
in these situations , it is rarely the preferred " choice " of the woman , more likely the result of her situation -lrb- ie financial , social and mental -rrb- .
i wholly support the bma in their decision to not reduce the limit .
nia , london i think it would be good to reduce the time limit .
i 'm surprised that doctors , who are lawfully bound to try to save life in this country , voted not to change the law and save some lives that might otherwise be lost .
clive , guildford , uk given that late terms abortions are actually very rare , and most abortions are performed far earlier , why bother lowering the limit ?
it wo n't affect many women , so there 's not really any point .
my personal feelings on abortion are that the foetus is not alive until it 's born .
until then , it 's only able to survive because its mother allows it to , and if she does n't want to , then that 's her choice .
no one should be a mother against her will , and it 's better for a child to never be born than to grow up hated by its mother .
louise , epsom , surrey abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases alan , london , uk the limit should be lower than 24 weeks .
at this stage the foetus is almost fully formed and is viable .
it only has to grow .
to those talking about ' a woman 's right to an abortion ' : abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases .
it should not be regarded as an alternative to contraception .
alan , london , uk yes absolutely .
i believe women have the right to choose but even 20 weeks is too late , unless it 's for medical reasons .
dee , windsor , england many birth defects are not found until 20 week scans when earlier scans are normal .
if a scan is abnormal at 20 weeks with a condition not compatible with life , or at best extremely difficult with maximal intervention , how can you expect someone to then deliver the child at birth knowing they will die or at best have a very slim chance of survival ?
james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .
question : " would you rather have been aborted than be unloved ? "
i think they would all ' choose life ' .
life should always be given a chance , deformed , diseased or unwanted .
as a society we need to give a voice to those without one .
in this case the unborn child .
chris chorlton , cairo , egypt to lucy of newcastle , so you think it is kinder to the ' child ' to abort ... especially if you can not give it what it ' needs ' .
well , mostly it ' needs ' to stay alive !
you are kidding yourself ... pretending that abortion is in the best interests of the child .
mandy phoenix , liverpool sounds entirely reasonable to me , although i do have misgivings about the time and effort put into saving premature babies .
as for the likes of sb from northants , how on earth can the medical profession stay out of the argument if it is they who have to perform the abortions and care for premature babies ?
or do you think doctors and nurses should be compelled to perform or assist in abortions ?
what about their rights to a clear conscience ?
steve , bristol , uk it should become much harder to go for a termination helene frost , newbury , berkshire yes , the limit should be reduced .
it should become much harder to go for a termination .
you never ever get over it , a mistake that i made myself .
helene frost , newbury , berkshire i was n't interested in this debate until i saw a scan of my son -lrb- now two and a half -rrb- at 10 weeks , with head , body and limbs already clearly developing .
i completely fail to understand how anyone can justify not reducing the limit to 10 weeks or even less except in truly exceptional circumstances .
peter drake , cambourne , uk yes the limit should be lowered .
as medical science progresses then the laws and limits need to be addressed .
abortion is not something that i could go through with but it needs to be there as a choice for people .
with the majority of pregnancies being detected so early -lrb- six weeks -rrb- if a pregnancy is unwanted then there is a lot of time to make this decision .
there does , however , always need to be a back up for those people who do find out about severally handicapped babies and undetected pregnancies .
s east , burgess hill it 's a surprisingly sensible decision from the bma regarding an issue that 's extremely difficult , personal and private for the woman concerned .
ken , london , uk i agree with abortion but with advances in medicine if a foetus is capable of living after 20 weeks gestation it should be given every chance .
if unwanted by the mother after she has had every chance of contraception the child should be put up for adoption .
there are plenty offering to take up these children .
dave s , warton , lancs five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision nicholas sammons , washington , dc i am very much pro-choice , but think that time limits on choosing to have an abortion should be stricter rather than looser .
what excuses could someone have for waiting five months to have an abortion ?
unless health hazards or child handicaps become an issue , five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision .
the longer one waits , the more ethically questionable abortions becomes .
waiting five months seems irresponsible .
nicholas sammons , washington , dc whatever is decided , please , keep this debate in medical and legal spheres .
it does not belong in the realm of politics or , much worse , in petty minded religious or ' high-moralistic ' squabbling .
keith , london , uk i had a termination at just under 24 weeks .
it was a very much wanted pregnancy but we found out the baby would have severe handicaps and probably not survive the birth .
we did n't feel it was fair on the baby or us to continue and so ' chose ' one of 2 uneasy options , to terminate .
the whole thing is horrendous and involves giving birth to your baby and living with the guilt and what ifs .
i can not imagine any women would go through that for trivial reasons , and do n't believe doctors would take it lightly .
i did n't ' believe ' in abortion at all before being placed in that position , it 's a totally different thing to take the moral high-ground when you have the luxury of never being in that dreadful position .
j , sheffield the limit should be reduced to 20 weeks given what we know now about the development of a foetus in the womb .
however , this reduction should be coupled with increased access to abortion clinics , making it easier for those who want an abortion to have one , earlier into the pregnancy gw , birmingham such late abortions are extremely rare .
i know a girl who was completely unaware that she was pregnant until 22 weeks .
she has a chronic illness and her medication affected her menstrual cycle , so she did n't even know that she was pregnant .
if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .
if a woman wants an abortion it 's her decision and frankly state , religion and the medical profession should stay out of it .
sp , northants the very fact that doctors see an ethical issue with late-term abortions shows that they consider an unborn child as an independent human life which needs their care .
it is not surprising that pro-abortionists find this an uncomfortable development .
ashley , london i feel strongly that this is n't a political football , it is a serious medico-legal and ethical matter that requires careful debate and not ill-informed sound-bites .
abortions cause great unhappiness , unwanted and unloved children cause even greater unhappiness .
bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .
surely a decision should be made by the parent -lrb- s -rrb- well in advance anyway ?
oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .
emma , leeds i think even 20 weeks is too much to be acceptable .
12 weeks should be the absolute maximum .
lk , london abortions that late in pregnancy are very rare and are not done lightly .
completely banning them is wrong because there are a number of life threatening conditions which are n't apparent until late in the pregnancy .
ian , rochester while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them louisa , sw london i 'm pleased that the bma have shown such good sense .
abortions over 22 weeks were only 1 % of all abortions performed last year .
while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them .
why should we force women to have babies they do n't want ?
despite advances in contraception no-one can make 100 % sure that they wo n't get pregnant without a hysterectomy .
for those who are worried about the overall rise in abortions , restricting late-term abortions will not reduce the overall rate .
louisa , sw london my son was born and survived at 24 weeks .
unless there is danger to the mother the limit should be reduced to even less than 20 weeks .
i can not see how a person can carry a child for several months and justify changing her mind at the last minute .
m grant , dundee abortion time limits should only be reduced to 20 weeks if a more detailed scan is offered earlier in the pregnancy - say at around 14 weeks - so that should there be anything wrong the baby , parents have the time to look into the disability and decide if they are able to continue with the pregnancy .
there should also be exceptions to the rule in extreme cases such as pregnancy after rape or if continuation of pregnancy causes the mother serious medical problems .
jc , oxford while i can see the argument for reducing the upper limit , it 's important to remember that it 's not premature babies with a chance of survival that are being aborted post 20 weeks .
as i understand it , the majority of abortions this late in pregnancy are as a result of foetal abnormality that is so severe the baby would n't live anyway .
jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .
in fact i say lower it to 18 weeks .
any woman considering an abortion has plenty of time to decide in four months .
it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .

do you think the upper limit for abortion should be lowered ?
doctors at the british medical association conference have voted against reducing the upper limit for abortion from 24 to 20 weeks .
some politicians and medics have questioned the current time limit as medical advances have boosted the survival chances of premature babies .
what do you think of the vote against reducing the limit ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable caroline , se london i agree with the bma 's decision not to endorse reducing the abortion limit , as most of these abortions are only carried out due to severe foetus abnormality anyway .
a lot of men who have commented on this issue seem to endorse serious restrictions on abortions in general .
women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable , a friend of mine had two negative home tests before a doctor confirmed she was three months pregnant .
why force women who want an abortion to have children ?
we should respect women who do not feel that they are ready or able to have children , not make them guilty .
caroline , se london why is it okay for a woman to choose to abort a baby that could survive outside the womb , but the act of terminating a baby 's life becomes murder the second it is born ?
it might make a whole difference to the mother , the only difference to the child is the environment he is growing in .
i completely sympathise with parents who find themselves having to decide to terminate a pregnancy at a late stage due to medical reasons .
just as it is in france , the law should differentiate abortions for personal reasons -lrb- and 12-14 weeks seem reasonable -rrb- and medical abortions where no date limits should be imposed as in these cases , it is likely the baby would not survive anyway .
lauren , sussex the woman is not the most important person to consider in all this and you do n't have to be a man to recognise that .
science has conclusively demonstrated that a 20 week old foetus is a living , sentient human being and its right to life is therefore paramount .
to suggest otherwise flies in the face of reason and ethics .
clive copus , london , england i had an abortion at just over 20 weeks .
it was a hugely difficult decision that i did not make lightly .
i was , for a long time fully unaware i was pregnant due to a lack of periods , and only had a few weeks to make my choice .
in the end i could not bring a -lrb- much wanted -rrb- child into the relationship that i was in ; which was emotionally and physically abusive .
i still feel that i made the right choice ; i am still battling with the scars and i had no right to inflict that on a child .
i do n't feel i did the wrong thing .
but i do wonder what could have been if i had been with the right person .
by all means reduce the upper limit .
but unless you have experienced this , please , refrain from piety and preaching .
i do n't think any woman goes through this lightly - no matter how she may try to react on the surface .
anon there is a principle here : it must be wrong to abort a baby who can survive , and not only survive , but be healthy .
my son was born very prematurely and is entirely healthy .
in a few years 20 week babies will survive -lrb- and be healthy -rrb- , so the limit should be about 18 weeks .
df , london the current limit is fine as it is .
abortion is never an easy option .
however , what should be changed is that the father should be able to have a say in the decision .
anthony , london , uk where a child could be born normally with no abnormalities , abortion should be done only to protect the health of the mother .
if a child is simply unwanted , there are plenty of childless couples out there who would love the chance to adopt .
david , cornwall , uk at 20 weeks we found that our baby had severe abnormalities , but chose to continue the pregnancy .
two weeks later -lrb- last weekend -rrb- he passed away , i was induced and delivered him .
it was a terrible ordeal , but worth it just to be able to hold him , look him in the eye and tell him that we loved him and had done everything we could to help him live .
i could n't have done that if i 'd chosen a termination .
anon , uk i am about to qualify as a midwife and i feel the safety and rights of women are paramount .
i am reassured that the law has not changed .
if it is made harder to obtain an abortion , inevitably there will be a ' black market ' which will provide these procedures , either in this country or abroad .
the foetus has no legal rights in the uk and i consider that important .
otherwise women become perceived as vessels for their unborn child and might be prosecuted for damage done to the foetus .
this in my mind is not acceptable .
sally harborow , brighton , uk one of the most common arguments is that of " it 's plenty of time for a woman to realize she 's pregnant " which is clearly untrue , just by reading the comments !
medications that mess with menstruation cycles , even how the foetus is positioned can make a pregnancy undetectable .
what then ?
be penalized because you truly did not know ?
glynnis baker , pa , usa as a mother i find it repugnant that people consider that it would be acceptable for a woman to experience the third trimester of pregnancy and the process of giving birth against their will , on the premise that a percentage of children born before 24 weeks survive .
what a cruel , mentally destructive and terrifying experience that would be .
dawn , kettering , england suggest a debate this topic was suggested by carrie ricketts , uk : while i can sympathise with the beliefs of those who disagree with abortion on principle , i struggle to understand those who want to reduce the limit to 20 weeks send us your suggestions for have your say debates i gave birth in december last year .
a shortage of appointments meant that i did n't get my " 20 week scan " until almost 24 weeks .
had my baby had a severe disability , my husband and i would have had just one day to decide whether we wanted a termination .
i agree in principle with reducing the time limit , but the ante-natal screening programme in this country needs significant improvement first .
rachel , west yorkshire i had an abortion at 21 weeks .
i had been very ill for several months and my periods had been stopped for 8 months .
i only found out i was pregnant at 20 weeks .
to all those people on here saying that 5 months is too much time to decide - try making that awful decision in 5 days .
i do n't regret the decision i made , i was not in a position then to look after my child .
anon , uk just because you have to agonise over the decision does not make it morally acceptable to terminate the life of a child - even one still in its mother 's womb .
and since when have men 's views on this issue not counted ?
clive copus , london , england people should not be forced to have babies that they do not want .
dave , essex what about the child 's right to life ?
helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .

she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .

i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .

an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .

to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?

james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .
question : " would you rather have been aborted than be unloved ? "
i think they would all ' choose life ' .
life should always be given a chance , deformed , diseased or unwanted .
as a society we need to give a voice to those without one .
in this case the unborn child .
chris chorlton , cairo , egypt to lucy of newcastle , so you think it is kinder to the ' child ' to abort ... especially if you can not give it what it ' needs ' .
well , mostly it ' needs ' to stay alive !
you are kidding yourself ... pretending that abortion is in the best interests of the child .
mandy phoenix , liverpool sounds entirely reasonable to me , although i do have misgivings about the time and effort put into saving premature babies .
as for the likes of sb from northants , how on earth can the medical profession stay out of the argument if it is they who have to perform the abortions and care for premature babies ?
or do you think doctors and nurses should be compelled to perform or assist in abortions ?
what about their rights to a clear conscience ?
steve , bristol , uk it should become much harder to go for a termination helene frost , newbury , berkshire yes , the limit should be reduced .
it should become much harder to go for a termination .
you never ever get over it , a mistake that i made myself .
helene frost , newbury , berkshire i was n't interested in this debate until i saw a scan of my son -lrb- now two and a half -rrb- at 10 weeks , with head , body and limbs already clearly developing .
i completely fail to understand how anyone can justify not reducing the limit to 10 weeks or even less except in truly exceptional circumstances .
peter drake , cambourne , uk yes the limit should be lowered .
as medical science progresses then the laws and limits need to be addressed .
abortion is not something that i could go through with but it needs to be there as a choice for people .
with the majority of pregnancies being detected so early -lrb- six weeks -rrb- if a pregnancy is unwanted then there is a lot of time to make this decision .
there does , however , always need to be a back up for those people who do find out about severally handicapped babies and undetected pregnancies .
s east , burgess hill it 's a surprisingly sensible decision from the bma regarding an issue that 's extremely difficult , personal and private for the woman concerned .
ken , london , uk i agree with abortion but with advances in medicine if a foetus is capable of living after 20 weeks gestation it should be given every chance .
if unwanted by the mother after she has had every chance of contraception the child should be put up for adoption .
there are plenty offering to take up these children .
dave s , warton , lancs five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision nicholas sammons , washington , dc i am very much pro-choice , but think that time limits on choosing to have an abortion should be stricter rather than looser .
what excuses could someone have for waiting five months to have an abortion ?
unless health hazards or child handicaps become an issue , five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision .
the longer one waits , the more ethically questionable abortions becomes .
waiting five months seems irresponsible .
nicholas sammons , washington , dc whatever is decided , please , keep this debate in medical and legal spheres .
it does not belong in the realm of politics or , much worse , in petty minded religious or ' high-moralistic ' squabbling .
keith , london , uk i had a termination at just under 24 weeks .
it was a very much wanted pregnancy but we found out the baby would have severe handicaps and probably not survive the birth .
we did n't feel it was fair on the baby or us to continue and so ' chose ' one of 2 uneasy options , to terminate .
the whole thing is horrendous and involves giving birth to your baby and living with the guilt and what ifs .
i can not imagine any women would go through that for trivial reasons , and do n't believe doctors would take it lightly .
i did n't ' believe ' in abortion at all before being placed in that position , it 's a totally different thing to take the moral high-ground when you have the luxury of never being in that dreadful position .
j , sheffield the limit should be reduced to 20 weeks given what we know now about the development of a foetus in the womb .
however , this reduction should be coupled with increased access to abortion clinics , making it easier for those who want an abortion to have one , earlier into the pregnancy gw , birmingham such late abortions are extremely rare .
i know a girl who was completely unaware that she was pregnant until 22 weeks .
she has a chronic illness and her medication affected her menstrual cycle , so she did n't even know that she was pregnant .
if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .
if a woman wants an abortion it 's her decision and frankly state , religion and the medical profession should stay out of it .
sp , northants the very fact that doctors see an ethical issue with late-term abortions shows that they consider an unborn child as an independent human life which needs their care .
it is not surprising that pro-abortionists find this an uncomfortable development .
ashley , london i feel strongly that this is n't a political football , it is a serious medico-legal and ethical matter that requires careful debate and not ill-informed sound-bites .
abortions cause great unhappiness , unwanted and unloved children cause even greater unhappiness .
bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .
surely a decision should be made by the parent -lrb- s -rrb- well in advance anyway ?
oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .
emma , leeds i think even 20 weeks is too much to be acceptable .
12 weeks should be the absolute maximum .
lk , london abortions that late in pregnancy are very rare and are not done lightly .
completely banning them is wrong because there are a number of life threatening conditions which are n't apparent until late in the pregnancy .
ian , rochester while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them louisa , sw london i 'm pleased that the bma have shown such good sense .
abortions over 22 weeks were only 1 % of all abortions performed last year .
while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them .
why should we force women to have babies they do n't want ?
despite advances in contraception no-one can make 100 % sure that they wo n't get pregnant without a hysterectomy .
for those who are worried about the overall rise in abortions , restricting late-term abortions will not reduce the overall rate .
louisa , sw london my son was born and survived at 24 weeks .
unless there is danger to the mother the limit should be reduced to even less than 20 weeks .
i can not see how a person can carry a child for several months and justify changing her mind at the last minute .
m grant , dundee abortion time limits should only be reduced to 20 weeks if a more detailed scan is offered earlier in the pregnancy - say at around 14 weeks - so that should there be anything wrong the baby , parents have the time to look into the disability and decide if they are able to continue with the pregnancy .
there should also be exceptions to the rule in extreme cases such as pregnancy after rape or if continuation of pregnancy causes the mother serious medical problems .
jc , oxford while i can see the argument for reducing the upper limit , it 's important to remember that it 's not premature babies with a chance of survival that are being aborted post 20 weeks .
as i understand it , the majority of abortions this late in pregnancy are as a result of foetal abnormality that is so severe the baby would n't live anyway .
jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .
in fact i say lower it to 18 weeks .
any woman considering an abortion has plenty of time to decide in four months .
it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .

do you think the upper limit for abortion should be lowered ?
doctors at the british medical association conference have voted against reducing the upper limit for abortion from 24 to 20 weeks .
some politicians and medics have questioned the current time limit as medical advances have boosted the survival chances of premature babies .
what do you think of the vote against reducing the limit ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable caroline , se london i agree with the bma 's decision not to endorse reducing the abortion limit , as most of these abortions are only carried out due to severe foetus abnormality anyway .
a lot of men who have commented on this issue seem to endorse serious restrictions on abortions in general .
women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable , a friend of mine had two negative home tests before a doctor confirmed she was three months pregnant .
why force women who want an abortion to have children ?
we should respect women who do not feel that they are ready or able to have children , not make them guilty .
caroline , se london why is it okay for a woman to choose to abort a baby that could survive outside the womb , but the act of terminating a baby 's life becomes murder the second it is born ?
it might make a whole difference to the mother , the only difference to the child is the environment he is growing in .
i completely sympathise with parents who find themselves having to decide to terminate a pregnancy at a late stage due to medical reasons .
just as it is in france , the law should differentiate abortions for personal reasons -lrb- and 12-14 weeks seem reasonable -rrb- and medical abortions where no date limits should be imposed as in these cases , it is likely the baby would not survive anyway .
lauren , sussex the woman is not the most important person to consider in all this and you do n't have to be a man to recognise that .
science has conclusively demonstrated that a 20 week old foetus is a living , sentient human being and its right to life is therefore paramount .
to suggest otherwise flies in the face of reason and ethics .
clive copus , london , england i had an abortion at just over 20 weeks .
it was a hugely difficult decision that i did not make lightly .
i was , for a long time fully unaware i was pregnant due to a lack of periods , and only had a few weeks to make my choice .
in the end i could not bring a -lrb- much wanted -rrb- child into the relationship that i was in ; which was emotionally and physically abusive .
i still feel that i made the right choice ; i am still battling with the scars and i had no right to inflict that on a child .
i do n't feel i did the wrong thing .
but i do wonder what could have been if i had been with the right person .
by all means reduce the upper limit .
but unless you have experienced this , please , refrain from piety and preaching .
i do n't think any woman goes through this lightly - no matter how she may try to react on the surface .
anon there is a principle here : it must be wrong to abort a baby who can survive , and not only survive , but be healthy .
my son was born very prematurely and is entirely healthy .
in a few years 20 week babies will survive -lrb- and be healthy -rrb- , so the limit should be about 18 weeks .
df , london the current limit is fine as it is .
abortion is never an easy option .
however , what should be changed is that the father should be able to have a say in the decision .
anthony , london , uk where a child could be born normally with no abnormalities , abortion should be done only to protect the health of the mother .
if a child is simply unwanted , there are plenty of childless couples out there who would love the chance to adopt .
david , cornwall , uk at 20 weeks we found that our baby had severe abnormalities , but chose to continue the pregnancy .
two weeks later -lrb- last weekend -rrb- he passed away , i was induced and delivered him .
it was a terrible ordeal , but worth it just to be able to hold him , look him in the eye and tell him that we loved him and had done everything we could to help him live .
i could n't have done that if i 'd chosen a termination .
anon , uk i am about to qualify as a midwife and i feel the safety and rights of women are paramount .
i am reassured that the law has not changed .
if it is made harder to obtain an abortion , inevitably there will be a ' black market ' which will provide these procedures , either in this country or abroad .
the foetus has no legal rights in the uk and i consider that important .
otherwise women become perceived as vessels for their unborn child and might be prosecuted for damage done to the foetus .
this in my mind is not acceptable .
sally harborow , brighton , uk one of the most common arguments is that of " it 's plenty of time for a woman to realize she 's pregnant " which is clearly untrue , just by reading the comments !
medications that mess with menstruation cycles , even how the foetus is positioned can make a pregnancy undetectable .
what then ?
be penalized because you truly did not know ?
glynnis baker , pa , usa as a mother i find it repugnant that people consider that it would be acceptable for a woman to experience the third trimester of pregnancy and the process of giving birth against their will , on the premise that a percentage of children born before 24 weeks survive .
what a cruel , mentally destructive and terrifying experience that would be .
dawn , kettering , england suggest a debate this topic was suggested by carrie ricketts , uk : while i can sympathise with the beliefs of those who disagree with abortion on principle , i struggle to understand those who want to reduce the limit to 20 weeks send us your suggestions for have your say debates i gave birth in december last year .
a shortage of appointments meant that i did n't get my " 20 week scan " until almost 24 weeks .
had my baby had a severe disability , my husband and i would have had just one day to decide whether we wanted a termination .
i agree in principle with reducing the time limit , but the ante-natal screening programme in this country needs significant improvement first .
rachel , west yorkshire i had an abortion at 21 weeks .
i had been very ill for several months and my periods had been stopped for 8 months .
i only found out i was pregnant at 20 weeks .
to all those people on here saying that 5 months is too much time to decide - try making that awful decision in 5 days .
i do n't regret the decision i made , i was not in a position then to look after my child .
anon , uk just because you have to agonise over the decision does not make it morally acceptable to terminate the life of a child - even one still in its mother 's womb .
and since when have men 's views on this issue not counted ?
clive copus , london , england people should not be forced to have babies that they do not want .
dave , essex what about the child 's right to life ?
helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .
i went into premature labour and had my daughter at 21 weeks gestation .
she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .
every woman should have the right if they so choose for whatever reason to have an abortion .
it 's not something that you take lightly and i had a week of misery and mental torture when i was trying to make a decision .
marie , berkhamsted , herts it 's interesting how everyone talks in weeks - it 's only just hit me that a 24 week old is 6 months old !
especially now , with science this far on , how can we say it 's ok to terminate a 6 month old unborn child ?
it 's also interesting how we see an unborn child as something we can terminate and a newly born child as something so precious we have to risk our lives to save .
the difference between them is just a few months .
kim lavery , belfast another thought .
i have a friend with spina bifida .
in seeking to understand his condition , i once asked if it would have been better if he had been born in recent years so that modern medicine could have helped him .
his observation was that modern medicine would have identified his condition earlier , and he would have been terminated .
likewise , on those that think it better to be aborted than to grow up as an unloved , unwanted child ; ask any one who has done so their view and whether they would have preferred to have been denied the chance to grow up at all ?
bill , gloucester , uk how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
d , england i 'm a neonatal nurse , which means i care for babies that are born prematurely or just need some sort of help before they can go home .
i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .
how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .
i realise everyone should have a choice because all circumstances are different , but i think it should be harder to do .
to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?
d , england i am a sonographer performing scans on mothers / babies .
there appear to be a lot of comments about how unfair it would be to only discover an abnormality at 20 weeks and force the mother to continue with the pregnancy - this is not what the limit is about .
abortion for foetal abnormality is still allowed up to term under present and new legislation - this limit is purely for social rather than medical reasons , and as such i would prefer a limit of 20 weeks .
helen , maidenhead as i scroll down the list of comments i see that most of the opinions come from men .
this is rather interesting as it is not the man who has to go through the procedure of abortion .
gary higgins , liverpool , england many of the comments seem to centre on women " choosing " late abortions .
most women who intend to have an abortion do so early on the pregnancy .
however , the abortions conducted in the 20-24 week period are generally as a result of discovering something is seriously wrong with either mother or foetus .
in these situations , it is rarely the preferred " choice " of the woman , more likely the result of her situation -lrb- ie financial , social and mental -rrb- .
i wholly support the bma in their decision to not reduce the limit .
nia , london i think it would be good to reduce the time limit .
i 'm surprised that doctors , who are lawfully bound to try to save life in this country , voted not to change the law and save some lives that might otherwise be lost .
clive , guildford , uk given that late terms abortions are actually very rare , and most abortions are performed far earlier , why bother lowering the limit ?
it wo n't affect many women , so there 's not really any point .
my personal feelings on abortion are that the foetus is not alive until it 's born .
until then , it 's only able to survive because its mother allows it to , and if she does n't want to , then that 's her choice .
no one should be a mother against her will , and it 's better for a child to never be born than to grow up hated by its mother .
louise , epsom , surrey abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases alan , london , uk the limit should be lower than 24 weeks .
at this stage the foetus is almost fully formed and is viable .
it only has to grow .
to those talking about ' a woman 's right to an abortion ' : abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases .
it should not be regarded as an alternative to contraception .
alan , london , uk yes absolutely .
i believe women have the right to choose but even 20 weeks is too late , unless it 's for medical reasons .
dee , windsor , england many birth defects are not found until 20 week scans when earlier scans are normal .
if a scan is abnormal at 20 weeks with a condition not compatible with life , or at best extremely difficult with maximal intervention , how can you expect someone to then deliver the child at birth knowing they will die or at best have a very slim chance of survival ?
james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .

if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .
if a woman wants an abortion it 's her decision and frankly state , religion and the medical profession should stay out of it .
sp , northants the very fact that doctors see an ethical issue with late-term abortions shows that they consider an unborn child as an independent human life which needs their care .
it is not surprising that pro-abortionists find this an uncomfortable development .
ashley , london i feel strongly that this is n't a political football , it is a serious medico-legal and ethical matter that requires careful debate and not ill-informed sound-bites .
abortions cause great unhappiness , unwanted and unloved children cause even greater unhappiness .
bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .
surely a decision should be made by the parent -lrb- s -rrb- well in advance anyway ?
oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .
emma , leeds i think even 20 weeks is too much to be acceptable .
12 weeks should be the absolute maximum .
lk , london abortions that late in pregnancy are very rare and are not done lightly .
completely banning them is wrong because there are a number of life threatening conditions which are n't apparent until late in the pregnancy .
ian , rochester while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them louisa , sw london i 'm pleased that the bma have shown such good sense .
abortions over 22 weeks were only 1 % of all abortions performed last year .
while late-term abortions are controversial they should be available to women who want them .
why should we force women to have babies they do n't want ?
despite advances in contraception no-one can make 100 % sure that they wo n't get pregnant without a hysterectomy .
for those who are worried about the overall rise in abortions , restricting late-term abortions will not reduce the overall rate .
louisa , sw london my son was born and survived at 24 weeks .
unless there is danger to the mother the limit should be reduced to even less than 20 weeks .
i can not see how a person can carry a child for several months and justify changing her mind at the last minute .
m grant , dundee abortion time limits should only be reduced to 20 weeks if a more detailed scan is offered earlier in the pregnancy - say at around 14 weeks - so that should there be anything wrong the baby , parents have the time to look into the disability and decide if they are able to continue with the pregnancy .
there should also be exceptions to the rule in extreme cases such as pregnancy after rape or if continuation of pregnancy causes the mother serious medical problems .
jc , oxford while i can see the argument for reducing the upper limit , it 's important to remember that it 's not premature babies with a chance of survival that are being aborted post 20 weeks .
as i understand it , the majority of abortions this late in pregnancy are as a result of foetal abnormality that is so severe the baby would n't live anyway .
jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .
in fact i say lower it to 18 weeks .
any woman considering an abortion has plenty of time to decide in four months .
it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .

do you think the upper limit for abortion should be lowered ?
doctors at the british medical association conference have voted against reducing the upper limit for abortion from 24 to 20 weeks .
some politicians and medics have questioned the current time limit as medical advances have boosted the survival chances of premature babies .
what do you think of the vote against reducing the limit ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable caroline , se london i agree with the bma 's decision not to endorse reducing the abortion limit , as most of these abortions are only carried out due to severe foetus abnormality anyway .
a lot of men who have commented on this issue seem to endorse serious restrictions on abortions in general .
women do not always know if they are pregnant by the 12 week mark , pregnancy test are not always reliable , a friend of mine had two negative home tests before a doctor confirmed she was three months pregnant .
why force women who want an abortion to have children ?
we should respect women who do not feel that they are ready or able to have children , not make them guilty .
caroline , se london why is it okay for a woman to choose to abort a baby that could survive outside the womb , but the act of terminating a baby 's life becomes murder the second it is born ?
it might make a whole difference to the mother , the only difference to the child is the environment he is growing in .
i completely sympathise with parents who find themselves having to decide to terminate a pregnancy at a late stage due to medical reasons .
just as it is in france , the law should differentiate abortions for personal reasons -lrb- and 12-14 weeks seem reasonable -rrb- and medical abortions where no date limits should be imposed as in these cases , it is likely the baby would not survive anyway .
lauren , sussex the woman is not the most important person to consider in all this and you do n't have to be a man to recognise that .
science has conclusively demonstrated that a 20 week old foetus is a living , sentient human being and its right to life is therefore paramount .
to suggest otherwise flies in the face of reason and ethics .
clive copus , london , england i had an abortion at just over 20 weeks .
it was a hugely difficult decision that i did not make lightly .
i was , for a long time fully unaware i was pregnant due to a lack of periods , and only had a few weeks to make my choice .
in the end i could not bring a -lrb- much wanted -rrb- child into the relationship that i was in ; which was emotionally and physically abusive .
i still feel that i made the right choice ; i am still battling with the scars and i had no right to inflict that on a child .
i do n't feel i did the wrong thing .
but i do wonder what could have been if i had been with the right person .
by all means reduce the upper limit .
but unless you have experienced this , please , refrain from piety and preaching .
i do n't think any woman goes through this lightly - no matter how she may try to react on the surface .
anon there is a principle here : it must be wrong to abort a baby who can survive , and not only survive , but be healthy .
my son was born very prematurely and is entirely healthy .
in a few years 20 week babies will survive -lrb- and be healthy -rrb- , so the limit should be about 18 weeks .
df , london the current limit is fine as it is .
abortion is never an easy option .
however , what should be changed is that the father should be able to have a say in the decision .
anthony , london , uk where a child could be born normally with no abnormalities , abortion should be done only to protect the health of the mother .
if a child is simply unwanted , there are plenty of childless couples out there who would love the chance to adopt .
david , cornwall , uk at 20 weeks we found that our baby had severe abnormalities , but chose to continue the pregnancy .
two weeks later -lrb- last weekend -rrb- he passed away , i was induced and delivered him .
it was a terrible ordeal , but worth it just to be able to hold him , look him in the eye and tell him that we loved him and had done everything we could to help him live .
i could n't have done that if i 'd chosen a termination .
anon , uk i am about to qualify as a midwife and i feel the safety and rights of women are paramount .
i am reassured that the law has not changed .
if it is made harder to obtain an abortion , inevitably there will be a ' black market ' which will provide these procedures , either in this country or abroad .
the foetus has no legal rights in the uk and i consider that important .
otherwise women become perceived as vessels for their unborn child and might be prosecuted for damage done to the foetus .
this in my mind is not acceptable .
sally harborow , brighton , uk one of the most common arguments is that of " it 's plenty of time for a woman to realize she 's pregnant " which is clearly untrue , just by reading the comments !
medications that mess with menstruation cycles , even how the foetus is positioned can make a pregnancy undetectable .
what then ?
be penalized because you truly did not know ?
glynnis baker , pa , usa as a mother i find it repugnant that people consider that it would be acceptable for a woman to experience the third trimester of pregnancy and the process of giving birth against their will , on the premise that a percentage of children born before 24 weeks survive .
what a cruel , mentally destructive and terrifying experience that would be .
dawn , kettering , england suggest a debate this topic was suggested by carrie ricketts , uk : while i can sympathise with the beliefs of those who disagree with abortion on principle , i struggle to understand those who want to reduce the limit to 20 weeks send us your suggestions for have your say debates i gave birth in december last year .
a shortage of appointments meant that i did n't get my " 20 week scan " until almost 24 weeks .
had my baby had a severe disability , my husband and i would have had just one day to decide whether we wanted a termination .
i agree in principle with reducing the time limit , but the ante-natal screening programme in this country needs significant improvement first .
rachel , west yorkshire i had an abortion at 21 weeks .
i had been very ill for several months and my periods had been stopped for 8 months .
i only found out i was pregnant at 20 weeks .
to all those people on here saying that 5 months is too much time to decide - try making that awful decision in 5 days .
i do n't regret the decision i made , i was not in a position then to look after my child .
anon , uk just because you have to agonise over the decision does not make it morally acceptable to terminate the life of a child - even one still in its mother 's womb .
and since when have men 's views on this issue not counted ?
clive copus , london , england people should not be forced to have babies that they do not want .
dave , essex what about the child 's right to life ?
helen , edinburgh reading over these comments it 's all about the woman 's right to choose .
what about the child 's right to life ?
in a world of ' human rights ' surely the right to life is more important than the right to choose !
helen , edinburgh i think the abortion rate should be lowered .
i went into premature labour and had my daughter at 21 weeks gestation .
she was breathing on her own and died after 2 1/2 hours .
what really gets to me is i had to deliver her naturally and it was a terrible ordeal .
yet a woman who has a late abortion often gets taken to theatre and put under general anaesthetic for the procedure .
ep , billingham , cleveland i finally had confirmation from my doctors that i was pregnant at nearly 24 weeks after months of blood test and urine tests , you can imagine my shock at this .
although i did consider abortion i went on to have a beautiful baby , however , i was glad to have had the option and a choice .
every woman should have the right if they so choose for whatever reason to have an abortion .
it 's not something that you take lightly and i had a week of misery and mental torture when i was trying to make a decision .
marie , berkhamsted , herts it 's interesting how everyone talks in weeks - it 's only just hit me that a 24 week old is 6 months old !
especially now , with science this far on , how can we say it 's ok to terminate a 6 month old unborn child ?
it 's also interesting how we see an unborn child as something we can terminate and a newly born child as something so precious we have to risk our lives to save .
the difference between them is just a few months .
kim lavery , belfast another thought .
i have a friend with spina bifida .
in seeking to understand his condition , i once asked if it would have been better if he had been born in recent years so that modern medicine could have helped him .
his observation was that modern medicine would have identified his condition earlier , and he would have been terminated .
likewise , on those that think it better to be aborted than to grow up as an unloved , unwanted child ; ask any one who has done so their view and whether they would have preferred to have been denied the chance to grow up at all ?
bill , gloucester , uk how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
d , england i 'm a neonatal nurse , which means i care for babies that are born prematurely or just need some sort of help before they can go home .
i have cared for many 23/24 week gestation babies and have seen most of them die , but some lead normal lives .
how can it be right to abort a baby at an age when it can be born and live ?
an infant born at 26 weeks is a regular occurrence and will pretty much always survive , only two weeks after the legal abortion limit .
i realise everyone should have a choice because all circumstances are different , but i think it should be harder to do .
to have a breast reduction / implant on the nhs you have to go through a psychiatric profile but you can abort a child at a viable age because you just do n't want it ?
d , england i am a sonographer performing scans on mothers / babies .
there appear to be a lot of comments about how unfair it would be to only discover an abnormality at 20 weeks and force the mother to continue with the pregnancy - this is not what the limit is about .
abortion for foetal abnormality is still allowed up to term under present and new legislation - this limit is purely for social rather than medical reasons , and as such i would prefer a limit of 20 weeks .
helen , maidenhead as i scroll down the list of comments i see that most of the opinions come from men .
this is rather interesting as it is not the man who has to go through the procedure of abortion .
gary higgins , liverpool , england many of the comments seem to centre on women " choosing " late abortions .
most women who intend to have an abortion do so early on the pregnancy .
however , the abortions conducted in the 20-24 week period are generally as a result of discovering something is seriously wrong with either mother or foetus .
in these situations , it is rarely the preferred " choice " of the woman , more likely the result of her situation -lrb- ie financial , social and mental -rrb- .
i wholly support the bma in their decision to not reduce the limit .
nia , london i think it would be good to reduce the time limit .
i 'm surprised that doctors , who are lawfully bound to try to save life in this country , voted not to change the law and save some lives that might otherwise be lost .
clive , guildford , uk given that late terms abortions are actually very rare , and most abortions are performed far earlier , why bother lowering the limit ?
it wo n't affect many women , so there 's not really any point .
my personal feelings on abortion are that the foetus is not alive until it 's born .
until then , it 's only able to survive because its mother allows it to , and if she does n't want to , then that 's her choice .
no one should be a mother against her will , and it 's better for a child to never be born than to grow up hated by its mother .
louise , epsom , surrey abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases alan , london , uk the limit should be lower than 24 weeks .
at this stage the foetus is almost fully formed and is viable .
it only has to grow .
to those talking about ' a woman 's right to an abortion ' : abortion is the last resort and should only be used rarely in exceptional medical cases .
it should not be regarded as an alternative to contraception .
alan , london , uk yes absolutely .
i believe women have the right to choose but even 20 weeks is too late , unless it 's for medical reasons .
dee , windsor , england many birth defects are not found until 20 week scans when earlier scans are normal .
if a scan is abnormal at 20 weeks with a condition not compatible with life , or at best extremely difficult with maximal intervention , how can you expect someone to then deliver the child at birth knowing they will die or at best have a very slim chance of survival ?
james , manchester , uk my local area only offers one scan - at 20 weeks .
if the baby has a severe disability , then the parents will not find out until it is too late for a termination if the limit is lowered .
is that fair ?
should women be forced to carry , deliver and nurse for the rest of their lives a child with no quality of life ?
what about any siblings ?
would it be fair on them ?
no .
kh , uk i 'm not exactly sure whether i agree with this .
what if a teenage girl needed more time to decide ?
then it would be a big problem for her .
yet i do understand the views of those who say that it needs to be lowered .
rhiannon , carmarthen no woman should be required to carry a child if she does not wish to , any more than we should be required to give up all our possessions not essential for life to feed the starving .
on the other hand , at some point , an emergency caesarean followed by adoption is the appropriate course , rather a termination .
maybe 22 weeks for a healthy foetus , up to 26-28 for a seriously handicapped one that would probably not survive .
steve linton , crail , fife it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth lynne thomas , wales it really depends on the circumstances surrounding each individual birth .
nobody can always speculate early on if everything is going to go okay .
what if a child dies in the womb at 23 weeks ?
would it have to stay in there for the full term while the mother knows all along her child is dead ?
you ca n't put time on such an individualistic personal experience .
lynne thomas , wales i am pleased with the outcome of this vote .
i believe that it is a woman 's right to choose to get pregnant and also her right to choose whether she continues with that pregnancy or not because it 's her body - nobody else 's .
liz , worthing surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ?
of course it 's better to abort as early as possible , but that is no reason to not allow parents who feel they wo n't be able to give the child what it needs to choose not to have that child albeit at a late stage of pregnancy .
lucy , newcastle " surely it is better for a child to be aborted than not wanted or not loved ? "
lucy says this above ...
let 's do a survey of all adults who feel they were unloved and unwanted as children .
question : " would you rather have been aborted than be unloved ? "
i think they would all ' choose life ' .
life should always be given a chance , deformed , diseased or unwanted .
as a society we need to give a voice to those without one .
in this case the unborn child .
chris chorlton , cairo , egypt to lucy of newcastle , so you think it is kinder to the ' child ' to abort ... especially if you can not give it what it ' needs ' .
well , mostly it ' needs ' to stay alive !
you are kidding yourself ... pretending that abortion is in the best interests of the child .
mandy phoenix , liverpool sounds entirely reasonable to me , although i do have misgivings about the time and effort put into saving premature babies .
as for the likes of sb from northants , how on earth can the medical profession stay out of the argument if it is they who have to perform the abortions and care for premature babies ?
or do you think doctors and nurses should be compelled to perform or assist in abortions ?
what about their rights to a clear conscience ?
steve , bristol , uk it should become much harder to go for a termination helene frost , newbury , berkshire yes , the limit should be reduced .
it should become much harder to go for a termination .
you never ever get over it , a mistake that i made myself .
helene frost , newbury , berkshire i was n't interested in this debate until i saw a scan of my son -lrb- now two and a half -rrb- at 10 weeks , with head , body and limbs already clearly developing .
i completely fail to understand how anyone can justify not reducing the limit to 10 weeks or even less except in truly exceptional circumstances .
peter drake , cambourne , uk yes the limit should be lowered .
as medical science progresses then the laws and limits need to be addressed .
abortion is not something that i could go through with but it needs to be there as a choice for people .
with the majority of pregnancies being detected so early -lrb- six weeks -rrb- if a pregnancy is unwanted then there is a lot of time to make this decision .
there does , however , always need to be a back up for those people who do find out about severally handicapped babies and undetected pregnancies .
s east , burgess hill it 's a surprisingly sensible decision from the bma regarding an issue that 's extremely difficult , personal and private for the woman concerned .
ken , london , uk i agree with abortion but with advances in medicine if a foetus is capable of living after 20 weeks gestation it should be given every chance .
if unwanted by the mother after she has had every chance of contraception the child should be put up for adoption .
there are plenty offering to take up these children .
dave s , warton , lancs five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision nicholas sammons , washington , dc i am very much pro-choice , but think that time limits on choosing to have an abortion should be stricter rather than looser .
what excuses could someone have for waiting five months to have an abortion ?
unless health hazards or child handicaps become an issue , five months is in my opinion plenty of time to make a decision .
the longer one waits , the more ethically questionable abortions becomes .
waiting five months seems irresponsible .
nicholas sammons , washington , dc whatever is decided , please , keep this debate in medical and legal spheres .
it does not belong in the realm of politics or , much worse , in petty minded religious or ' high-moralistic ' squabbling .
keith , london , uk i had a termination at just under 24 weeks .
it was a very much wanted pregnancy but we found out the baby would have severe handicaps and probably not survive the birth .
we did n't feel it was fair on the baby or us to continue and so ' chose ' one of 2 uneasy options , to terminate .
the whole thing is horrendous and involves giving birth to your baby and living with the guilt and what ifs .
i can not imagine any women would go through that for trivial reasons , and do n't believe doctors would take it lightly .
i did n't ' believe ' in abortion at all before being placed in that position , it 's a totally different thing to take the moral high-ground when you have the luxury of never being in that dreadful position .
j , sheffield the limit should be reduced to 20 weeks given what we know now about the development of a foetus in the womb .
however , this reduction should be coupled with increased access to abortion clinics , making it easier for those who want an abortion to have one , earlier into the pregnancy gw , birmingham such late abortions are extremely rare .
i know a girl who was completely unaware that she was pregnant until 22 weeks .
she has a chronic illness and her medication affected her menstrual cycle , so she did n't even know that she was pregnant .
if she had not had the option of termination , then the baby would almost certainly have been born with severe disabilities , and she may have suffered life-threatening complications .
i am against abortion generally , but people should have the right to make informed decisions , and if this person did not have the option to terminate it could have had severe mental and physical consequences for both mother and baby .
anonymous , birmingham , uk this issue needs to be split into the abortion for medical / health reasons and the abortion for lifestyle reasons .
for the latter example , 8-10 weeks is more than enough time for someone to realise they are pregnant and take the appropriate action .
on the other hand , if an abortion is needed for medical reasons then these should be assessed on an individual basis and the current limits are probably more or less suitable for this .
since having children myself , i am surprised at how my views on this issue have changed , and i suspect that the majority of people not wanting a change do not have kids themselves .
chris chitty , bourne uk the fact that babies born as soon as 24 weeks are being saved is testament to the advances in medical care .
however , i do n't think that it can be used as justification for a reduction of the upper limit to 20 weeks , regardless of whether you are pro or anti abortion .
if this precedent was set , then we might see a steady reduction in the upper limit in line with further advances in medicine .
hans stiles , chessington , england no one sets out wanting an abortion clare , st albans my local health authority only offers one scan at 20 weeks .
this is the only chance to see if the baby is alright or if there is something seriously wrong with it .
i doubt most abortions over 20 weeks are simple lifestyle choices most would occur when a serious birth defect is detected .
no one sets out wanting an abortion .
clare , st albans no .
medical science may well have advanced to the point that the survival rates of premature babies are considerably better .
so what ?
they are surviving due to intervention on our part .

bob , welwyn while a woman should always retain the right to an abortion , science should be a counter-weight to the timing .
as survival rates -lrb- as in term passed -rrb- come down , so must the limits .
if there are any medical reasons why a woman can not decide whether her child should be terminated by 20 to 24 weeks - then these tests need to be made a priority !
the timing must be considered a basic ' human right ' .
s allsop , essex yes .
the less developed a baby is when the time comes to terminate the better .

oliver clamp , monte carlo , france in my opinion , if the mother wants to have an abortion at any time during her pregnancy that is her right , and hers alone .

jack hatfield , brighton , uk yes , the lowering of this upper limit is long overdue .

it 's about time that we moved abortion law more in the favour of the unborn child .
chris , chorley good that the bma have voted against and maybe the debate will now stop but i doubt it as the pro-lifers are against abortion full-stop .
very few babies survive at 24 or less weeks and if they survive they have medical problems as they grow up .
