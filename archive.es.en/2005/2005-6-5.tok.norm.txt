the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.06.2005 müsli instead of sauerkraut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not all just order and rules in germany hitler , war , beer , cars - americans who still exclusively associate that with germany can drop in at new york 's grand central for an exhibition to clear up those clichés and find out what makes modern germany tick . new york 's famous grand central station is frequented by half a million commuters daily , rushing to get their trains , browsing through the shops below the tracks or grabbing a coffee and sandwich at the several restaurants and cafes in the massive complex . given its prominent pride of place in the heart of the city , it seems the best place to connect with a large number of americans .
that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany . " the exhibition " germany sensational " runs through june 23 , 2005 daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art explores the boundaries of hospitality berlin has become a center for modern art and design , and hotels are also getting in the game , blurring the boundaries between museums and hotels .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .

" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here .

" it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .

" playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .

" we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2005 eu battles to keep crisis from widening großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder : weakened at home but strong when it comes to the eu the eu risks further turmoil as it fights to avoid a escalation of one of its worst crises even as french and german leaders underlined saturday that the ratification process of the new constitution should go on . the 25-nation bloc is desperately grappling for a way ahead after french and dutch voters dealt an apparently fatal double-blow to its long-cherished constitution last week . but there is no obvious solution , and the crisis is threatening to drive a wedge between key eu governments not only about the fate of the constitution , but about the whole future of the european project . " we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- crisis talks to assess eu charter wreckage german chancellor schröder will meet french president chirac for a working dinner in berlin saturday to salvage the eu 's constitution after dutch and french voters categorically rejected the new charter this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy köhler : debate needed on army 's future germany -pipe- 05.06.2005 students on target for the bundeswehr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the classroom to the -lrb- fake -rrb- war zone , german students play war as germany 's defense ministry and its armed forces prepare to celebrate 50 years of existence , the german army - the bundeswehr - continues to raise its profile by giving students the opportunity to handle firearms . exactly 50 years ago on june 7 , 1955 , the german federal ministry of defense came into being under the control of the first secretary of defense , the conservative minister theodor blank . the landmark in germany 's modern history will be celebrated tuesday next week with a program of events planned to commemorate half a century of the german federal armed forces , the bundeswehr . but as preparations continue apace , the actual celebrations as far as the bundeswehr is concerned could be muted .
the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

" we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany . " the exhibition " germany sensational " runs through june 23 , 2005 daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de art explores the boundaries of hospitality berlin has become a center for modern art and design , and hotels are also getting in the game , blurring the boundaries between museums and hotels .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels . " between the founder states and the newcomers who have emerged from a half-century of dictatorship , the world vision is not the same , " he said . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " europe has to be more modest " elmar brok , conservative european mep and member of the convention which drew up the eu charter told dw-tv that it should have been approved before expansion and warned the eu had to take note of its citizens ' concerns .
-lrb- june 4 , 2005 -rrb- politicians cast doubt on further expansion if the proposed european union constitutional treaty is not adopted , further enlargement of the 25-member club to include turkey and other candidates will be impossible , german lawmakers said saturday .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .
" and actually there is no better place than here in the heart of the city because here you do n't need to bang on the drum to attract people - they 're already here . " a more realistic picture of germany german ambassador to the us , wolfgang ischinger , who opened the exhibition titled " germany sensational " on thursday , said it was high time that the often antiquated image of germany held by many americans was changed . " it 's not encouraging when you read surveys and study results that show that the image of germany among many americans is still influenced by the figure of adolf hitler , the holocaust and the second world war , " ischinger said .
" and then there are other clichés , albeit positive , that however do n't present the whole germany either - lederhosen , beer and maybe cars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger added that what was needed was a more realistic picture : " that germany is n't just a country , where high-tech products are made , but where millions of people feel comfortable and have fun in life - too few americans know that . " playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .
visitors are invited to try it out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a healthy breakfast with müsli , fruit , coffee , honey , egg the playful theme runs through the culinary fare on offer too .
americans expecting the clichéd stodgy eisbein -lrb- pork knuckle -rrb- and sauerkraut -lrb- sour cabbage -rrb- are in for a surprise .
visitors instead can sample some light , health food instead - müsli , a breakfast cereal made of rolled oats , wheat flakes and various pieces of dried fruits and nuts and the choice of an increasing number of health-conscious germans , as well as health chocolate bars filled with nuts and fruits rather than sugar and cream . even the german language - for many foreigners a nightmare and about which the famous american author mark twain once said that ' only the dead had time to learn it ' - has been made as easy as child 's play in the exhibition . uwe rau from the goethe institut explained that popular videos showing kids explaining words and boards illustrating examples of words from poetry together with graphics was all part of the show , intended to show that german is simpler to learn than widely believed . tradition is n't dead despite the playful and unconventional exhibits intended to show a more modern and fun germany , the show is n't entirely devoid of the more widely known german traditions . bildunterschrift : the skyline over cologne michaela klare of the german national tourist office is clear that the country after all wants to draw - much like last year - millions of american tourists to germany in future too . " the americans love the culture , tradition , the good food and drinks in germany , " said klare .
" they often begin their trips in bavaria and end in berlin .
and it 's simply important that we bring our country to the heart of manhattan to the vanderbilt hall . " the double-edged strategy of old and new - traditional beer halls and high-tech - seems to be working . new yorker david ilten , who visited the exhibition , was impressed .
" i find it highly interesting , it 's a wonderful exhibition about modern germany .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .

" we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

in all of switzerland 's 26 cantons - or states - the " yes " campaign managed to fend off stiff opposition to the schengen accord with eu nations , as well as iceland and norway , according to official results . a narrow win for the " yes " had been expected . the last opinion poll , 12 days ago , showed 55 percent in favor , despite continued euroscepticism from swiss voters .
that figure caused last-minute jitters in the " yes " camp , because it was down around seven points on polls a month earlier and showed the impact of a hardball campaign by opponents who said the schengen accord would hit swiss sovereignty . switzerland has stayed outside the eu despite being surrounded by its members .
it manages its ties with the 25-nation bloc through a range of bilateral accords . eu hails vote european union leaders sunday welcomed the decision by swiss voters to join the bloc 's schengen passport-free zone which abolishes frontiers for individuals travelling between states that have signed up to the agreement . luc frieden , minister of justice of luxembourg which currently holds the eu presidency , hailed " the clear result of the swiss people - it is a good day for europe and switzerland . " " on the one hand free circulation will obviously be made easier , on the other cooperation in the security context can be reinforced , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and justice commissioner franco frattini . they said that the result would make examination of asylum requests easier and marked an important step forward in relations between switzerland and the eu .
signatories to schengen include the 15 members of the eu before the may 2004 enlargement , with the exceptions of britain and ireland , plus non-eu members norway and iceland . fear of loss of sovereignty the schengen area , named after a small town in luxembourg where the treaty was signed in 1985 , now includes 13 eu states , as well as iceland and norway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entry to the town of schengen in luxembourg the agreement abolishes systematic identity checks on travelers within the area and provides for a common visa in return for stronger controls on the area 's outer fringe , as well as closer cooperation between police forces . schengen 's swiss opponents said that amounts to giving up a chunk of their sovereignty to brussels . " we do n't trust an organization that ca n't manage to resolve its enormous internal problems , " said hans fehr , a parliamentarian for the right-wing swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- and head of an isolationist lobby group , the association for a neutral and independent switzerland -lrb- auns -rrb- . with the vote also covering membership of the eu 's dublin agreement on handling asylum seekers , lurid anti-schengen campaign leaflets have raised fears of rising crime and job losses to illicit immigrant labor . with the exception of the svp , all the major political parties were supporting the step into schengen , which was already approved earlier by parliament . " the svp is preying on people 's fears , " said didier berberat , a socialist party mp . while access to schengen 's computerized crime database is prized by most police unions in switzerland , it is loathed by swiss left-wingers who oppose the step into the area . afp / dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eurosceptic swiss vote on freer rein for eu travelers just days after france and holland , two of the eu 's founding nations , rejected a new eu charter , the eu-wary swiss are voting in a weekend referendum on whether to abolish most border controls with their neighbors .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .

" playful and light the exhibits on display are correspondingly playful .
for instance , given the looming soccer world cup in germany next year , german researchers have designed a soccer game with dog robots , who chase a orange-colored ball with the help of a software hooked via a memory stick in the dogs ' bellies .

that 's exactly what the organizers of an exhibition meant to bring americans up to date on current day germany seemed to think .
this week the show called " germany sensational " opened in the majestic vanderbilt hall of the grand central station . organizer peter soetje , head of the goethe institut , germany 's language and culture institute , in new york , agreed that the venue was perfect .
" we were wondering where we could place a huge show on german culture and language in new york , " soetje said .

" we do seem to be condemned to a new period of ' euro-sclerosis ' , " said john palmer of the european policy centre , affirming that the eu constitution is " to all intents and purposes dead . " the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point .

" the eu 's luxembourg presidency has called for a " period of reflection , " trying to keep a lid on the situation ahead of an eu summit next week which is at serious risk of turning into a shouting match . some have suggested that the summit could admit that the charter is dead , but then start to " cherry pick " key elements of the text , to be simply agreed by eu leaders rather than set in stone in a full-blown treaty . chirac , schröder push for further ratification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and wife doris greet chirac in berlin but french president jacques chirac and germany 's gerhard schröder reiterated saturday over a working dinner their desire for the ratification process to go on .
every eu member country has " the right and the duty " to takes its own decision on the constitution , said a german spokesman after the two men met over dinner to plot a way out of the crisis . it emerged on friday that schröder intends to call for a " pause for reflection " when eu leaders gather at a summit in brussels on june 16-17 to plan the way forward . political observers said saturday 's meeting between chirac and schröder was designed to show that france and germany remain the powerhouse of the eu , as britain , regarded as a repository of free market values , prepares to take over the six-month rotating presidency of the eu on july 1 . the times of london , deeply eurosceptic , jeered that the meeting was between a lame duck -lrb- chirac -rrb- and a dead duck -lrb- schröder -rrb- .
chirac 's position has been hugely damaged by the french rejection of the constitution and his poll ratings have collapsed . schröder too has been hit by a series of disastrous local election results and wants a general election brought forward to september . all eyes on britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw , right , with prime minister tony blair .
but on monday all eyes will turn to britain , where foreign secretary jack straw is set to make a statement on london 's plans for its own referendum . he is widely expected to announce that britain - set to take over the eu 's rotating presidency next month - is suspending those plans .
while not canceling them altogether , such a move will only raise more questions about the credibility of pressing ahead with ratification . " we think it is right to pause and reflect , " said europe minister douglas alexander last week . more widely , the crisis has set the stage for serious clashes over the very direction of the eu , which underwent its biggest ever expansion from 15 to 25 countries last year .
in particular , tensions risk erupting into the open over the bloc 's economic reform agenda . france 's may 29 rejection of the constitution was widely blamed on french voters ' opposition to the so-called anglo-saxon liberal economic model , espoused chiefly by prime minister tony blair 's new labour government . there has rarely been a greater risk of tension between france 's " social model " and the free market fervor of britain and its allies - notably among the eu 's ex-communist newcomer states . economic matters also threaten to provide a concrete focus of dispute at next week 's summit , which until the constitution crisis erupted was due to be dominated by wrangling over the eu 's 2007-2013 budget plans .
with the gloves off after his " no " vote , chirac is likely to give no ground on a key sticking point in the talks , namely britain 's refusal to surrender its long-cherished budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 . most analysts believe a budget accord is therefore virtually impossible .
but luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker said it is even more important now to demonstrate that the eu can still function . " now , even more so than before -lrb- the french and dutch votes -rrb- we have a driving obligation to reach an agreement , " he said . tricky issues remain unresolved even if an accord were struck on that , far wider issues remain , with everything from the bloc 's future expansion plans to its role on the international stage and the future of the euro coming into question . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding up the eu is proving difficult there is also the fundamental issue raised by the french and dutch votes of the yawning gap between europe 's elites and ordinary voters - amid fears that even if ratification goes ahead there may be a " domino " effect on other polls . many believe that , ultimately , europe 's crisis may only start to be resolved when key political leaders change - with elections expected in germany this year , france in 2007 and blair expected to go at some point . " there is more tension now than for many years , " said paul magnette of the free university of brussels .

the german army faces a tough time in its modern form as it faces up to the challenges of a new millennium . painful reforms have been planned and have started to be implemented ; deployments have scattered german soldiers across the globe on mostly uncelebrated missions and the bundeswehr is often forced into unpopular public relations exercises . students come to experience the army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one such exercise is the annual event at the army base in immendingen in the black forest where students from a number of south german universities come to experience the thrill of shooting military standard automatic weapons . about 80 students stand in line in the morning dew of a bavarian saturday morning at 8 . it 's not a time most of these students are accustomed to and they are about to take part in an exercise that none of them have experienced before . " this has been the arrangement for the past five years , " says reservist stefan bächle who is the co-organizer of this year 's event .
" the idea was to give those who have never seen what the army is like from the inside to get a feel for it .
the armed forces have an interest in it , of course .
it may offer opportunities for some of the people here . " shooting gallery offers different incentives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the students in attendance all have different reasons for coming .
" i was in the army for 12 months before and was simply interested in coming back again , " one says . " i did the alternative service , " says another referring to the choice young germans have to either do compulsory military or civil service .
" to be completely honest , i would like to simply shoot . " during the last few years , more and more women have attended the bundeswehr shooting days and this year , a quarter of the group is female .
" i 'm interested in archery and shooting and thought it would be a good opportunity to gain experience , " one said . for some in the group , it is the first chance they 've had to fire a weapon .
" it was fun .
i even hit the target a couple of times , " said julia biehn . women have a sniper 's eye the shooting results are compared after each student has shot a variety of weapons at the distant target .
the girls seem to have a better eye for single shot weapons which is why the boys are hoping to regain some dignity with the next weapon : the machine gun . the hit rates seem to prove that the mg3 machine gun is more suited for the men .
at 13 kilograms it certainly seems to be a man 's weapon and the male students handle it better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from the political talk of the future of the bundeswehr and the moral questions posed by the fact that the real job is to shoot people not targets , the students agree that their time with the army has been fun and informative . " i 've got a new respect for these weapons , " says one as he prepares to leave .
" i 've also had a good insight into the work of the armed forces . " and with that , the students march off home in almost military fashion . anke hagedorn -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de as germany 's role changes , so does military the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .

clark boyd reports on how a scottish music fan is using his podcast to expose the world to tartan rock .
miss the occupier 's track external male became a podcast hit mark is , in his own words , " just a guy , " living and working in glasgow .
he has got a wife and two kids .
he runs a small window and office cleaning business .
he is not a musician and he is not a broadcaster .
but he is a podcaster , and his show - tartanpodcast - aims to bring scottish music to a wider audience .
the podcast 's format is straightforward .
mark plays three featured tunes with " a wee bit of chat " in between .
podcasts are home-grown radio programs put up on the web .
listeners subscribe to shows for free , the latest of which is sent automatically to digital music players .
for now , mark insists on using only his first name .
he is not sure he wants anyone , outside of his wife and kids , to know he is hosting a music podcast just yet .
maybe that is because the show does not go quite as smoothly as mark would like sometimes .
the microphone slips , or mark can not quite remember the name of the band or the song he has just played .
he usually just laughs it off , and besides , it is exactly that kind of low-fi sound that appeals to fans of podcasts .
usually , there is no overly slick production , no " radio voices , " just real people talking about things that interest them .
" i love making the tartanpodcast , " says mark .
" i get ridiculously enthusiastic about it . "
love of music mark started tartanpodcast back in march , when he realised he needed an outlet .
" being a creative person , but not having a job that supports any degree of creativity whatsoever , i noticed that there was this thing called podcasting , and thought maybe this was something i could do , " he says .
gum were pleased to offer a track for the show " i 'd listened to a few different podcasts , and it was obvious that ordinary people , if they wanted , recorded these little radio programmes on their computers and put it on the internet .
and i thought this potentially could be an outlet . "
mark knew podcasting is not that hard to do , technically speaking .
he just needed a microphone , a computer , some editing software , and an internet connection .
the question was , what would he podcast about ?
for mark , the answer was easy .
his great love is new music , especially music made by bands in scotland .
the problem was tackling the copyright and other legal issues involved in putting music out on the internet .
mark came up with a practical solution .
he started contacting scottish bands directly , and asked for their permission to play some of their songs on his podcast .
groups like the glasgow-based gum were only too happy to have a podcasting audience for their track , crime .
so too was the scottish outfit miss the occupier , whose track external male became an instant hit on his podcast .
and another band , hotrod cadets , had the first overseas sales of their album breaking up , thanks to tartanpodcast .
global audience mark says the response to tartanpodcast 's all-scottish line-up was impressive .
within weeks of launching the podcast , he was getting e-mails from the us , croatia , belgium , new zealand and japan .
hotrod cadets received international exposure " it 's really caught the imagination of people around the world , " says mark .
" maybe they picture scotland as being this little backwards country .
in reality , cities like glasgow have a thriving music scene .
" the feedback i 've received , and the bands have received , have been enormous .
people around the world have caught on to the scottish music scene . "
the scottish podcaster also believes that podcasting will revolutionise how new artists promote their music .
" they wo n't try to plug them on radio stations like they would in the past , " says mark .
" they 'll turn to the podcasting community and say ' guys , will you play my music ? '
even if it 's only 200 or 300 people around the world listening , that 's an audience you would n't have the vehicle to get outside podcasting . "
mark spends five or six hours a week preparing , recording , editing and uploading tartanpodcast .
his wife , he likes to joke , says he spends twice that amount of time .
he says he would podcast full-time if he could .
" everybody 's dream job is to do something that they love and get paid for it .
so if there was a way to be paid that would be ideal .
at the moment , even if it was a part-time thing , it would be something i would consider doing . "
a few big-name podcasters are getting advertisers and sponsorship deals .
but for now , mark , like most podcasters , will have to be content with his show being a labour of love , not money .
and he obviously loves doing it .
he has already expanded from one show a week to three .

gum were pleased to offer a track for the show " i 'd listened to a few different podcasts , and it was obvious that ordinary people , if they wanted , recorded these little radio programmes on their computers and put it on the internet .
and i thought this potentially could be an outlet . "
mark knew podcasting is not that hard to do , technically speaking .
he just needed a microphone , a computer , some editing software , and an internet connection .
the question was , what would he podcast about ?
for mark , the answer was easy .
his great love is new music , especially music made by bands in scotland .
the problem was tackling the copyright and other legal issues involved in putting music out on the internet .
mark came up with a practical solution .
he started contacting scottish bands directly , and asked for their permission to play some of their songs on his podcast .
groups like the glasgow-based gum were only too happy to have a podcasting audience for their track , crime .
so too was the scottish outfit miss the occupier , whose track external male became an instant hit on his podcast .
and another band , hotrod cadets , had the first overseas sales of their album breaking up , thanks to tartanpodcast .
global audience mark says the response to tartanpodcast 's all-scottish line-up was impressive .
within weeks of launching the podcast , he was getting e-mails from the us , croatia , belgium , new zealand and japan .
hotrod cadets received international exposure " it 's really caught the imagination of people around the world , " says mark .
" maybe they picture scotland as being this little backwards country .
in reality , cities like glasgow have a thriving music scene .
" the feedback i 've received , and the bands have received , have been enormous .
people around the world have caught on to the scottish music scene . "
the scottish podcaster also believes that podcasting will revolutionise how new artists promote their music .
" they wo n't try to plug them on radio stations like they would in the past , " says mark .
" they 'll turn to the podcasting community and say ' guys , will you play my music ? '
even if it 's only 200 or 300 people around the world listening , that 's an audience you would n't have the vehicle to get outside podcasting . "
mark spends five or six hours a week preparing , recording , editing and uploading tartanpodcast .
his wife , he likes to joke , says he spends twice that amount of time .
he says he would podcast full-time if he could .
" everybody 's dream job is to do something that they love and get paid for it .
so if there was a way to be paid that would be ideal .
at the moment , even if it was a part-time thing , it would be something i would consider doing . "
a few big-name podcasters are getting advertisers and sponsorship deals .
but for now , mark , like most podcasters , will have to be content with his show being a labour of love , not money .
and he obviously loves doing it .
he has already expanded from one show a week to three .

he runs a small window and office cleaning business .
he is not a musician and he is not a broadcaster .
but he is a podcaster , and his show - tartanpodcast - aims to bring scottish music to a wider audience .
the podcast 's format is straightforward .
mark plays three featured tunes with " a wee bit of chat " in between .
podcasts are home-grown radio programs put up on the web .
listeners subscribe to shows for free , the latest of which is sent automatically to digital music players .
for now , mark insists on using only his first name .
he is not sure he wants anyone , outside of his wife and kids , to know he is hosting a music podcast just yet .
maybe that is because the show does not go quite as smoothly as mark would like sometimes .
the microphone slips , or mark can not quite remember the name of the band or the song he has just played .
he usually just laughs it off , and besides , it is exactly that kind of low-fi sound that appeals to fans of podcasts .
usually , there is no overly slick production , no " radio voices , " just real people talking about things that interest them .

listeners subscribe to shows for free , the latest of which is sent automatically to digital music players .
for now , mark insists on using only his first name .
he is not sure he wants anyone , outside of his wife and kids , to know he is hosting a music podcast just yet .
maybe that is because the show does not go quite as smoothly as mark would like sometimes .
the microphone slips , or mark can not quite remember the name of the band or the song he has just played .
he usually just laughs it off , and besides , it is exactly that kind of low-fi sound that appeals to fans of podcasts .
usually , there is no overly slick production , no " radio voices , " just real people talking about things that interest them .
" i love making the tartanpodcast , " says mark .
" i get ridiculously enthusiastic about it . "
love of music mark started tartanpodcast back in march , when he realised he needed an outlet .
" being a creative person , but not having a job that supports any degree of creativity whatsoever , i noticed that there was this thing called podcasting , and thought maybe this was something i could do , " he says .
gum were pleased to offer a track for the show " i 'd listened to a few different podcasts , and it was obvious that ordinary people , if they wanted , recorded these little radio programmes on their computers and put it on the internet .
and i thought this potentially could be an outlet . "
mark knew podcasting is not that hard to do , technically speaking .
he just needed a microphone , a computer , some editing software , and an internet connection .
the question was , what would he podcast about ?
for mark , the answer was easy .
his great love is new music , especially music made by bands in scotland .
the problem was tackling the copyright and other legal issues involved in putting music out on the internet .
mark came up with a practical solution .
he started contacting scottish bands directly , and asked for their permission to play some of their songs on his podcast .
groups like the glasgow-based gum were only too happy to have a podcasting audience for their track , crime .
so too was the scottish outfit miss the occupier , whose track external male became an instant hit on his podcast .
and another band , hotrod cadets , had the first overseas sales of their album breaking up , thanks to tartanpodcast .
global audience mark says the response to tartanpodcast 's all-scottish line-up was impressive .
within weeks of launching the podcast , he was getting e-mails from the us , croatia , belgium , new zealand and japan .
hotrod cadets received international exposure " it 's really caught the imagination of people around the world , " says mark .
" maybe they picture scotland as being this little backwards country .
in reality , cities like glasgow have a thriving music scene .
" the feedback i 've received , and the bands have received , have been enormous .
people around the world have caught on to the scottish music scene . "
the scottish podcaster also believes that podcasting will revolutionise how new artists promote their music .
" they wo n't try to plug them on radio stations like they would in the past , " says mark .
" they 'll turn to the podcasting community and say ' guys , will you play my music ? '
even if it 's only 200 or 300 people around the world listening , that 's an audience you would n't have the vehicle to get outside podcasting . "
mark spends five or six hours a week preparing , recording , editing and uploading tartanpodcast .
his wife , he likes to joke , says he spends twice that amount of time .
he says he would podcast full-time if he could .
" everybody 's dream job is to do something that they love and get paid for it .
so if there was a way to be paid that would be ideal .
at the moment , even if it was a part-time thing , it would be something i would consider doing . "
a few big-name podcasters are getting advertisers and sponsorship deals .
but for now , mark , like most podcasters , will have to be content with his show being a labour of love , not money .
and he obviously loves doing it .
he has already expanded from one show a week to three .
