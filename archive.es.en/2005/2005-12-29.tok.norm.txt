1 , is an economic heavyweight when it comes to linking the developing eastern and more prosperous western halves of europe . hannes androsch , a former austrian finance minister who is now a businessman dealing with eastern europe , told afp : " what meant a lot to us was the annus mirabilis when the cold war came to an end " and barriers fell to trade with former soviet bloc states . this meant that the " logic of geography " was restored for austria , once the center of the pre-world war i austrian-hungarian empire and smack in the middle of europe , bordering italy , switzerland and germany to the west and slovenia , hungary , slovakia and the czech republic to the east . " we took great advantage of this fundamental change that occurred in 1989-90 -lrb- when the iron curtain fell -rrb- and are also doing the same after enlargement -lrb- of the european union in 2004 -rrb- , " androsch said . austria is the largest foreign investor in former communist states romania and bulgaria , as well as much of the former yugoslavia . austrian firms investing in former soviet states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian oil company omv has bought into the east european oil industry austrian firms are buying up bank , insurance , oil , telecommunications and other companies throughout the old soviet bloc .
takeovers have included erste bank 's acquisition of romanian bank banco comerciala romana and oil company omv 's purchase of its romanian rival petrom . friedrich mostböck , head of research for erste bank , said that " looking at austria 's equity market , more than 80 percent of the business is with central and eastern european companies . "
and that business is profitable .
average earnings growth for firms listed on the austrian stock exchange was 72.8 percent in 2005 , he said . mostböck said austrian companies " invested a lot in the -lrb- former communist -rrb- region in 1989 , when the iron curtain fell , and are now gaining a lot out of the region . " connection with eastern europe an advantage he said that while other western nations , such as germany , are also big players in the " new europe , " the austrians have historic roots to those countries and have similar mentalities , which makes dealing with people easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna makes eastern visitors feel more at home .
said androsch : " when hungarians come to visit vienna , for instance , they do not say they are visiting austria but say ' we are making a visit to our brother-in-law . " ' omv , whose market capitalization accounts for almost 20 percent of the austrian stock market , is " a major player in the oil business " in the new europe of former communist states , androsch said . the austrian connection with the former soviet bloc states of eastern europe will have staying power , mostböck said . these countries have levels per capita of gross domestic product that are " 15 to 20 years behind the levels in the european union , perhaps 25 years . " " we are saying it 's a story of one or two decades " for these countries to catch up to the standard of living of the more prosperous west , mostböck said . and eu enlargement has reduced the risk in investing since " all these countries have to meet european standards " as they fulfill maastricht financial conditions and other eu institutional requirements . austria benefiting more than others from expansion austria is benefiting from what has become an " extended home market , " mostböck said . in addition , austria gets more of a boost from trade with the east than does an economic giant like germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's eastern investments barely register on its balance sheet .
mostböck cited the case of the german firm deutsche telecom , a global player , which is active in hungary and croatia in major acquisitions which only impact " 1.5 or 2.0 percent of its overall sales or earnings . " but erste bank , for instance , is " not a global player " and because it is smaller , it gets boosts from the region to sales or earnings of " 50 to 60 percent -lrb- in relation to the bank 's size -rrb- , " mostböck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the european legacy of the fall of the wall german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .

he negotiated the release of german tourists held hostage in the sahara in 2003 . born on jan .
28 , 1948 in berlin , chrobog studied law in freiburg , aix-en-provence and göttingen .
in 1972 , he switched to the diplomatic corps and headed the offices of then foreign minister walter scheel and his successor , hans-dietrich genscher . he represented germany at the united nations in new york , later in singapore and at the european union in brussels .
he was german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 . chrobog then returned to germany to serve as foreign minister joschka fischer 's deputy and gained a reputation as a careful and gifted crisis manager - someone who could deal with the toughest of tasks . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . his biggest challenge came in april 2003 , when as deputy foreign minister he led an emergency task force charged with resolving the kidnapping of 15 european tourists - nine of whom were german - in the sahara desert .
one hostage died during her captivity , but the others were freed six months later thanks to chrobog 's tenacious negotiations and good contacts . alternatives to ransom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european tourists arrive in germany in august 2003 after being kidnapped in the sahara there was speculation later about how high a ransom germany paid for the release of the hostages .
but chrobog made clear that the issue of ransom had no place in the public debate over the kidnappings . questioned by journalists shortly before his trip to yemen , chrobog was categorical .
" you know if we talked about a ransom and explained that we were paying it all over the place , then we would invite it , " chrobog said .
" we ca n't do that .
it 's highly dangerous .
and besides , ransom is n't at the center of such negotiations . " instead , he stressed , there are alternatives to paying a ransom . " lots of patience , negotiations , long drawn out negotiations .
the hostage-taking in algeria lasted six months .
i was under unbelievable public pressure to come up with a quick solution , " chrobog said .
" but you ca n't just do that .
military , police deployments are n't possible .
you can only negotiate .
all possible contacts are useful .
patience , patience , patience .
there is no other recipe . " since his retirement in mid-2005 , chroborg has acted as chairman of the supervisory board at the bmw foundation herbert quandt . it remains to be seen whether the 65-year-old chrobog 's long experience with crisis-management will stand him in good stead during his own kidnapping in yemen .
it 's unclear whether the kidnappers are even aware of the identity of their hostage . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de officials hope to free hostages in yemen soon yemeni authorities say they are hopeful of a speedy release of a kidnapped former high-ranking german official and his family seized by tribesmen in the eastern part of the country .

" unacceptable " russian stance prior to dispatching his energy minister , ivan plachkov , to moscow , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko chaired a meeting with prime minister yury yekhanurov , plachkov and other officials in the capital kiev . gazprom has said it wants ukraine to start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators protest against moscow 's demand speaking at a cabinet meeting in kiev , yekhanurov described a price of $ 230 as " unacceptable , " interfax news agency reported .

1 , is an economic heavyweight when it comes to linking the developing eastern and more prosperous western halves of europe . hannes androsch , a former austrian finance minister who is now a businessman dealing with eastern europe , told afp : " what meant a lot to us was the annus mirabilis when the cold war came to an end " and barriers fell to trade with former soviet bloc states . this meant that the " logic of geography " was restored for austria , once the center of the pre-world war i austrian-hungarian empire and smack in the middle of europe , bordering italy , switzerland and germany to the west and slovenia , hungary , slovakia and the czech republic to the east . " we took great advantage of this fundamental change that occurred in 1989-90 -lrb- when the iron curtain fell -rrb- and are also doing the same after enlargement -lrb- of the european union in 2004 -rrb- , " androsch said . austria is the largest foreign investor in former communist states romania and bulgaria , as well as much of the former yugoslavia . austrian firms investing in former soviet states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian oil company omv has bought into the east european oil industry austrian firms are buying up bank , insurance , oil , telecommunications and other companies throughout the old soviet bloc .
takeovers have included erste bank 's acquisition of romanian bank banco comerciala romana and oil company omv 's purchase of its romanian rival petrom . friedrich mostböck , head of research for erste bank , said that " looking at austria 's equity market , more than 80 percent of the business is with central and eastern european companies . "
and that business is profitable .
average earnings growth for firms listed on the austrian stock exchange was 72.8 percent in 2005 , he said . mostböck said austrian companies " invested a lot in the -lrb- former communist -rrb- region in 1989 , when the iron curtain fell , and are now gaining a lot out of the region . " connection with eastern europe an advantage he said that while other western nations , such as germany , are also big players in the " new europe , " the austrians have historic roots to those countries and have similar mentalities , which makes dealing with people easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna makes eastern visitors feel more at home .
said androsch : " when hungarians come to visit vienna , for instance , they do not say they are visiting austria but say ' we are making a visit to our brother-in-law . " ' omv , whose market capitalization accounts for almost 20 percent of the austrian stock market , is " a major player in the oil business " in the new europe of former communist states , androsch said . the austrian connection with the former soviet bloc states of eastern europe will have staying power , mostböck said . these countries have levels per capita of gross domestic product that are " 15 to 20 years behind the levels in the european union , perhaps 25 years . " " we are saying it 's a story of one or two decades " for these countries to catch up to the standard of living of the more prosperous west , mostböck said . and eu enlargement has reduced the risk in investing since " all these countries have to meet european standards " as they fulfill maastricht financial conditions and other eu institutional requirements . austria benefiting more than others from expansion austria is benefiting from what has become an " extended home market , " mostböck said . in addition , austria gets more of a boost from trade with the east than does an economic giant like germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's eastern investments barely register on its balance sheet .
mostböck cited the case of the german firm deutsche telecom , a global player , which is active in hungary and croatia in major acquisitions which only impact " 1.5 or 2.0 percent of its overall sales or earnings . " but erste bank , for instance , is " not a global player " and because it is smaller , it gets boosts from the region to sales or earnings of " 50 to 60 percent -lrb- in relation to the bank 's size -rrb- , " mostböck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the european legacy of the fall of the wall german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .

al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .
al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional .

1 , austria hopes to revive europe by infusing the debate about the eu constitution , enlargement and budget with " energy and confidence . " six years after eu members in feb .
2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 . " as far as the constitution is concerned , i do n't think that we can succeed with cosmetic changes only .
that would not do justice to the great importance of this topic , " said plassnik . european model of life apart from institutional tools , one needs to define the " european model of life , " which guarantees jobs and growth - both of which will be on the council 's agenda in march - as well as environmental protection and europe 's place in the world , plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plassnik will be integral in the accession talks with bulgaria and romania in addition to backing the so-called " bolkestein " directive on liberalizing services and the european directive on work hours , austria will emphasize eu enlargement as one of its top priorities . as a bridge between east and west , austria will be looking to stabilize the balkans in the name of the " european peace project , " said plassnik , who is personally involved in eu accession talks with croatia .
austria will also be steering the entry of bulgaria and romania into the eu , set for 2007 . in early october , austria , whose population is largely opposed to turkey 's entry into the eu , tried to block an agreement by the 25 members on the framework of accession talks with turkey , but finally gave in under pressure from its partners . plassnik added " there is no reason to have any suspicions " about austria 's disposition towards turkey . radical changes ? the austrian presidency will also have to strike a compromise with the commission and the parliament on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget after the european council reached a last-minute agreement on dec .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimistic about 2006 : eu commission president barroso schüssel , who favours a european tax to fund the eu budget , called for " radical changes " in the ways the union is financed and will propose that members raise their contribution to research funds to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product . eu commission president jose manuel barroso is hoping that the budgetary disagreements will become a thing of the past : " i think we can enter 2006 with more optimism .
we can now concentrate on things which are more important for our citizens : namely , growth and more jobs , " barroso told deutsche welle . lastly , austria will suggest the creation of a european human rights agency in vienna . austria , which entered the eu in 1995 , had previously held the presidency , in the second half of 1998 .

" i have often been asked in recent weeks and months why i want to govern this country with all the problems before us , " she wrote .
" i always reply : because i believe in this country and its people !
because germany is full of opportunities and i am convinced that we can seize them . "
targeting joblessness she said the top priority remained driving down the unemployment rate , currently hovering at 10.9 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people line up for public assistance " i can not accept that we can not find work for so many men and women in our country who are willing to work , " merkel wrote , noting that the government had already launched an initiative to make hiring cheaper and more attractive . " let 's surprise ourselves with how much is possible , and what we can achieve , " she wrote in an appeal for the populace to overcome what is often written about as a general lethargy and negative attitude towards change .
" we need people to be ready to make changes . " families first she said she would also focus government efforts to revive economic growth , calling it the only way to ensure the sanctity of the country 's cherished social welfare system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is promising support for families with chilren merkel noted the government had earmarked 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to stimulate the economy and create jobs , including funding for infrastructure improvements and research and development . the government will also zero in on germany 's mounting demographic problems , caused by the low birthrate and an aging population , merkel wrote . " we want to make it easier for parents to care for the children .
only if our country is strong and our economy is competitive can we help all those who need our help . " a positive start merkel , who only narrowly beat former leader gerhard schroeder in the september general election , is widely seen as off to a good start as chancellor and has watched her poll ratings steadily climb since taking office . it cost the government 2.95 million euros to publish the letter in magazines and regional and national newspapers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2005 austria preps for challenging eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister plassnik wants a thorough discussion of the eu constitution when it takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 , austria hopes to revive europe by infusing the debate about the eu constitution , enlargement and budget with " energy and confidence . " six years after eu members in feb .
2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 . " as far as the constitution is concerned , i do n't think that we can succeed with cosmetic changes only .
that would not do justice to the great importance of this topic , " said plassnik . european model of life apart from institutional tools , one needs to define the " european model of life , " which guarantees jobs and growth - both of which will be on the council 's agenda in march - as well as environmental protection and europe 's place in the world , plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plassnik will be integral in the accession talks with bulgaria and romania in addition to backing the so-called " bolkestein " directive on liberalizing services and the european directive on work hours , austria will emphasize eu enlargement as one of its top priorities . as a bridge between east and west , austria will be looking to stabilize the balkans in the name of the " european peace project , " said plassnik , who is personally involved in eu accession talks with croatia .
austria will also be steering the entry of bulgaria and romania into the eu , set for 2007 . in early october , austria , whose population is largely opposed to turkey 's entry into the eu , tried to block an agreement by the 25 members on the framework of accession talks with turkey , but finally gave in under pressure from its partners . plassnik added " there is no reason to have any suspicions " about austria 's disposition towards turkey . radical changes ? the austrian presidency will also have to strike a compromise with the commission and the parliament on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget after the european council reached a last-minute agreement on dec .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimistic about 2006 : eu commission president barroso schüssel , who favours a european tax to fund the eu budget , called for " radical changes " in the ways the union is financed and will propose that members raise their contribution to research funds to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product . eu commission president jose manuel barroso is hoping that the budgetary disagreements will become a thing of the past : " i think we can enter 2006 with more optimism .
we can now concentrate on things which are more important for our citizens : namely , growth and more jobs , " barroso told deutsche welle . lastly , austria will suggest the creation of a european human rights agency in vienna . austria , which entered the eu in 1995 , had previously held the presidency , in the second half of 1998 .
it will hand it over to finland for the second half of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu presidency tenure fails to impress as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .
in the end , little was achieved .

27 , 2005 -rrb- 2005 : the year the eu would rather forget after the soaring high of its " big bang " enlargement in 2004 , the european union plunged to a historic low in 2005 amid a crisis over its constitution and a protracted row over the budget .

1 , austria hopes to revive europe by infusing the debate about the eu constitution , enlargement and budget with " energy and confidence . " six years after eu members in feb .
2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 . " as far as the constitution is concerned , i do n't think that we can succeed with cosmetic changes only .
that would not do justice to the great importance of this topic , " said plassnik . european model of life apart from institutional tools , one needs to define the " european model of life , " which guarantees jobs and growth - both of which will be on the council 's agenda in march - as well as environmental protection and europe 's place in the world , plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plassnik will be integral in the accession talks with bulgaria and romania in addition to backing the so-called " bolkestein " directive on liberalizing services and the european directive on work hours , austria will emphasize eu enlargement as one of its top priorities . as a bridge between east and west , austria will be looking to stabilize the balkans in the name of the " european peace project , " said plassnik , who is personally involved in eu accession talks with croatia .
austria will also be steering the entry of bulgaria and romania into the eu , set for 2007 . in early october , austria , whose population is largely opposed to turkey 's entry into the eu , tried to block an agreement by the 25 members on the framework of accession talks with turkey , but finally gave in under pressure from its partners . plassnik added " there is no reason to have any suspicions " about austria 's disposition towards turkey . radical changes ? the austrian presidency will also have to strike a compromise with the commission and the parliament on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget after the european council reached a last-minute agreement on dec .
17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : optimistic about 2006 : eu commission president barroso schüssel , who favours a european tax to fund the eu budget , called for " radical changes " in the ways the union is financed and will propose that members raise their contribution to research funds to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product . eu commission president jose manuel barroso is hoping that the budgetary disagreements will become a thing of the past : " i think we can enter 2006 with more optimism .
we can now concentrate on things which are more important for our citizens : namely , growth and more jobs , " barroso told deutsche welle . lastly , austria will suggest the creation of a european human rights agency in vienna . austria , which entered the eu in 1995 , had previously held the presidency , in the second half of 1998 .
it will hand it over to finland for the second half of 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu presidency tenure fails to impress as britain 's six-month rotation as european union president draws to a close , observers look back on the past half year , which was marked by a series of attempts to reform the eu .

" i have often been asked in recent weeks and months why i want to govern this country with all the problems before us , " she wrote .
" i always reply : because i believe in this country and its people !
because germany is full of opportunities and i am convinced that we can seize them . "
targeting joblessness she said the top priority remained driving down the unemployment rate , currently hovering at 10.9 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people line up for public assistance " i can not accept that we can not find work for so many men and women in our country who are willing to work , " merkel wrote , noting that the government had already launched an initiative to make hiring cheaper and more attractive . " let 's surprise ourselves with how much is possible , and what we can achieve , " she wrote in an appeal for the populace to overcome what is often written about as a general lethargy and negative attitude towards change .
" we need people to be ready to make changes .

" we want to make it easier for parents to care for the children .
only if our country is strong and our economy is competitive can we help all those who need our help . " a positive start merkel , who only narrowly beat former leader gerhard schroeder in the september general election , is widely seen as off to a good start as chancellor and has watched her poll ratings steadily climb since taking office . it cost the government 2.95 million euros to publish the letter in magazines and regional and national newspapers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

" they will be freed safely and soon , " a government official told reuters , adding that authorities were still in contact with the al-abdullah tribe which the kidnappers belong to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tribesman want to pressure the government in sana to release prisoners the family of five was abducted from a restaurant on the road to the southern port city of aden in the shabwa region , 480 kilometers -lrb- 300 miles -rrb- east of the capital sana , yemeni authorities confirmed . no politically-motived act reports said chrobog and his family were guests of the yemeni junior foreign minister , who is a former ambassador to germany .
authorities have ruled out a politically-motivated kidnapping . one of the kidnappers told reuters on wednesday that the lives of the family - captured to put pressure on sana to release five tribesmen in jail on criminal charges including murder - would be at risk if yemen used force to free them . the yemeni interior ministry is reported to know where the kidnappers are holding the hostages , and have said the area will be sealed off by security forces by thursday afternoon . hostages said to be well german authorities confirmed the disappearance of chrobog - who served as german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 - and his family in yemen late wednesday , but initially declined to say whether they had been kidnapped . the german government was in touch with all the relevant authorities in yemen and were hoping for a swift release of chrobog and his family , said foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger in berlin .
the government has set up an emergency task force . " we will concentrate all our efforts on bringing this family back to security as soon as possible , " he said . chrobog was expected to be freed by the afternoon , german public television broadcaster ard reported thursday , without naming any sources .
a middle east correspondent for the broadcaster said he had personally spoken to chrobog and his family and confirmed they were well . a gifted crisis manager himself chrobog , 65 , served as deputy foreign ministry under former chancellor gerhard schröder and was seen as a gifted crisis manager . ironically , he helped secure the release of 14 german tourists taken hostage in mali in august 2003 . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . as is customary in yemen 's bandit-ridden region , the german tourists had been given soldiers to accompany their convoy of two vehicles , but the kidnappers were took advantage of the break for a meal to take the family hostage . a matter of hours or days , says tour group " they have been getting things to eat and to drink , more than what you might expect , " said a representative from the local tour agency abu taleb group -lrb- atg -rrb- , a partner of the german studiosus group .
" this is an affair of hours , at most days . " it was the fourth abduction of foreign tourists in yemen this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists visiting remote areas of yemen are particularly at risk last week , two austrian tourists were held hostage for three days in the eastern maarib region .
in november , two swiss holidaymakers were briefly held by tribesmen in the same area .
and in august , three spaniards were abducted in the south before being released unharmed . despite its proximity to oil-rich saudi arabia , yemen is one of the world 's poorest countries and more than 200 foreigners have been kidnapped in the past decade . nearly all of the kidnappings have been carried out by tribesmen seeking to put pressure on the central government and the hostages have generally been released unharmed . but in december 1998 , three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants were killed when security forces stormed their hideout . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans .

asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2005 russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reverberations of the gas row are being felt as far away as germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .
it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .
for months , the two sides have been wrangling about new pricing for gas supplies and transit rights . russia wants ukraine to immediately begin paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies heavily on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . old contracts governing russian state-run giant gazprom 's gas supplies to and via ukraine to customers in europe run out on dec .
31 .
if russia and ukraine fail to reach a compromise by then , things could turn distinctly frosty - not just between moscow and kiev , but also in germany which relies on russia for 35 percent of its gas supplies . no reason for panic , as yet energy experts in germany are n't hitting the panic button as yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are confident that supplies within germany wo n't run out soon " germany can be supplied for more than two month from gas storage tanks , " martin weyand , head of the federal association of german gas and water economy -lrb- bgw -rrb- pointed out this week . it 's estimated that the largest gas storage tank belonging to kassel-based energy company wingas could supply two million households for a year with gas . even e.on ruhrgas has made adequate arrangements to avoid any supply bottlenecks , according to e.on ruhrgas boss burckhard bergmann . long-drawn out crisis could hit supplies at the same time , experts warn that things could turn dire if supplies are cut off too long . " if the crisis continues for too long and the winter is tough , then we have our limits too , " bergmann said . daily rheinische post reported that essen-based e.on ruhrgas was feverishly working on tackling possible crisis scenarios and that it was considering importing more supplies in the short-term from norway and the netherlands . others are also cautioning that in future germany would also have to look at alternative transport routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building of the north european gas pipeline is a controversial project rainer seele , head of wingas told the rheinische pos t that the gas dispute underlined the importance of an additional route such as the planned north european gas pipeline that will link the massive russian gas fields with germany under the baltic sea . with it , germany and europe would achieve " independence from political instability , " seele said . conflict could drag on so far , the row between russia and moscow shows no signs of abating . moscow has threatened ukraine that it will completely turn off the gas taps , while ukraine has countered that it will stop its territory from being used as a gas transit . at the heart of the conflict is gazprom 's demand that ukraine start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians protest against russian gas demands in kiev , the government says the russian demand is tantamount to economic pressure and a political disciplinary measure for its orange revolution last year and ukraine 's increasing pro-western stance . as proof , ukraine points to the fact that pro-moscow nations such as belarus will also in future be charged significantly less for russian gas . the chances for solving the tangle appear bleak .
according to ukrainian sources , the dispute will likely drag on until march when parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in kiev . talks failure may not be so bad after all from a western point of view , this would be the worst option since an interruption of gas supplies will be unavoidable .
in addition to germany , several other western european countries would be affected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder and russian leader putin are the best of chums so far , germany 's close relations to russia when it comes to gas and oil have always been viewed as secure .
but the row between moscow and kiev makes it clear how fragile this supply line is and particularly , how dangerous the increasing fixation on big suppliers - in this case russia - is for germany and europe . considering all this , a failure of russian-ukrainian gas negotiations may not be such a bad thing - it might work as a shock and a trigger for a restructuring of german and european energy policy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine , russia in search of 11th-hour deal on gas dispute russia and ukraine have moved to settle a rancorous dispute on gas prices , ahead of a threat by russian state-run gas giant gazprom to cut off deliveries to ukraine by jan .
1 if no agreement is reached .

" unacceptable " russian stance prior to dispatching his energy minister , ivan plachkov , to moscow , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko chaired a meeting with prime minister yury yekhanurov , plachkov and other officials in the capital kiev . gazprom has said it wants ukraine to start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators protest against moscow 's demand speaking at a cabinet meeting in kiev , yekhanurov described a price of $ 230 as " unacceptable , " interfax news agency reported . " this is direct economic pressure on the country .
this is not a market approach , and the ball remains in gazprom 's court , " he said . " legally ignorant " the ukrainian prime minister sparked a storm of protest from moscow on tuesday when he asserted that ukraine had an automatic right under existing accords to take 15 percent of all russian gas that transits through the pipeline network on ukrainian territory . gazprom quickly slammed that assertion as " irresponsible and legally ignorant , " while russia 's influential industry and energy minister , viktor khristenko , called it " surprising , at the very least " and said ukraine had no automatic right to any russian gas . hopes of a compromise the dispute has produced increasingly colorful and testy exchanges between the two sides in recent days , but analysts forecast that despite all the sound and fury as the jan .
1 deadline approached , a compromise deal would be found . " we believe there will be an eleventh hour compromise between russia and ukraine on the gas price issue , " brokerage firm renaissance capital said in its daily market commentary . " we expect gazprom to achieve a higher price relative to 2005 , and it will be a price that ukraine has the ability to pay , " renaissance capital said .
it described the price range being sought by gazprom as " plainly absurd . " ukraine has long benefited from cheap russian gas and gazprom , noting that the european union earlier this month formally recognized ukraine as a " market economy , " said it was under no obligation to continue giving kiev the preferential treatment meted out to some other ex-soviet republics . " a traitor to ukraine " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant tymoshenko has weighed in the gas dispute meanwhile , ukraine 's fiery former prime minister and one-time powerful businesswoman in the gas sector , yulia tymoshenko , offered to help negotiate a deal with russia but said kiev had a right to the cheap gas and should not agree to any higher price . any official who signed a higher price deal with gazprom would be " a traitor to ukraine , " said tymoshenko , who remains a powerful political voice in the country and who is trying to position herself and her party ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in the country next march . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 . " as far as the constitution is concerned , i do n't think that we can succeed with cosmetic changes only .

1 , is an economic heavyweight when it comes to linking the developing eastern and more prosperous western halves of europe . hannes androsch , a former austrian finance minister who is now a businessman dealing with eastern europe , told afp : " what meant a lot to us was the annus mirabilis when the cold war came to an end " and barriers fell to trade with former soviet bloc states . this meant that the " logic of geography " was restored for austria , once the center of the pre-world war i austrian-hungarian empire and smack in the middle of europe , bordering italy , switzerland and germany to the west and slovenia , hungary , slovakia and the czech republic to the east . " we took great advantage of this fundamental change that occurred in 1989-90 -lrb- when the iron curtain fell -rrb- and are also doing the same after enlargement -lrb- of the european union in 2004 -rrb- , " androsch said . austria is the largest foreign investor in former communist states romania and bulgaria , as well as much of the former yugoslavia . austrian firms investing in former soviet states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian oil company omv has bought into the east european oil industry austrian firms are buying up bank , insurance , oil , telecommunications and other companies throughout the old soviet bloc .
takeovers have included erste bank 's acquisition of romanian bank banco comerciala romana and oil company omv 's purchase of its romanian rival petrom . friedrich mostböck , head of research for erste bank , said that " looking at austria 's equity market , more than 80 percent of the business is with central and eastern european companies . "
and that business is profitable .
average earnings growth for firms listed on the austrian stock exchange was 72.8 percent in 2005 , he said . mostböck said austrian companies " invested a lot in the -lrb- former communist -rrb- region in 1989 , when the iron curtain fell , and are now gaining a lot out of the region . " connection with eastern europe an advantage he said that while other western nations , such as germany , are also big players in the " new europe , " the austrians have historic roots to those countries and have similar mentalities , which makes dealing with people easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna makes eastern visitors feel more at home .
said androsch : " when hungarians come to visit vienna , for instance , they do not say they are visiting austria but say ' we are making a visit to our brother-in-law . " ' omv , whose market capitalization accounts for almost 20 percent of the austrian stock market , is " a major player in the oil business " in the new europe of former communist states , androsch said . the austrian connection with the former soviet bloc states of eastern europe will have staying power , mostböck said . these countries have levels per capita of gross domestic product that are " 15 to 20 years behind the levels in the european union , perhaps 25 years . " " we are saying it 's a story of one or two decades " for these countries to catch up to the standard of living of the more prosperous west , mostböck said . and eu enlargement has reduced the risk in investing since " all these countries have to meet european standards " as they fulfill maastricht financial conditions and other eu institutional requirements . austria benefiting more than others from expansion austria is benefiting from what has become an " extended home market , " mostböck said . in addition , austria gets more of a boost from trade with the east than does an economic giant like germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's eastern investments barely register on its balance sheet .
mostböck cited the case of the german firm deutsche telecom , a global player , which is active in hungary and croatia in major acquisitions which only impact " 1.5 or 2.0 percent of its overall sales or earnings . " but erste bank , for instance , is " not a global player " and because it is smaller , it gets boosts from the region to sales or earnings of " 50 to 60 percent -lrb- in relation to the bank 's size -rrb- , " mostböck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the european legacy of the fall of the wall german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .

" i have often been asked in recent weeks and months why i want to govern this country with all the problems before us , " she wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2005 al qaeda responsible for kidnap says freed hostage osthoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff also denied reports that she was considering returning to iraq amid confusing and contradictory remarks about her capture and alleged return to iraq , former german hostage susanne osthoff claimed that a group affiliated to al qaeda was behind her kidnapping . susanne osthoff , the german archeologist who was abducted in iraq and released after 24 days in captivity , has said a group linked to al qaeda 's leader in iraq , abu musab al zarqawi , was behind her kidnapping last month , as a report thursday said she is planning to return to the country . " i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2005 russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reverberations of the gas row are being felt as far away as germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .
it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .
for months , the two sides have been wrangling about new pricing for gas supplies and transit rights . russia wants ukraine to immediately begin paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies heavily on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . old contracts governing russian state-run giant gazprom 's gas supplies to and via ukraine to customers in europe run out on dec .
31 .
if russia and ukraine fail to reach a compromise by then , things could turn distinctly frosty - not just between moscow and kiev , but also in germany which relies on russia for 35 percent of its gas supplies . no reason for panic , as yet energy experts in germany are n't hitting the panic button as yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are confident that supplies within germany wo n't run out soon " germany can be supplied for more than two month from gas storage tanks , " martin weyand , head of the federal association of german gas and water economy -lrb- bgw -rrb- pointed out this week . it 's estimated that the largest gas storage tank belonging to kassel-based energy company wingas could supply two million households for a year with gas . even e.on ruhrgas has made adequate arrangements to avoid any supply bottlenecks , according to e.on ruhrgas boss burckhard bergmann . long-drawn out crisis could hit supplies at the same time , experts warn that things could turn dire if supplies are cut off too long . " if the crisis continues for too long and the winter is tough , then we have our limits too , " bergmann said . daily rheinische post reported that essen-based e.on ruhrgas was feverishly working on tackling possible crisis scenarios and that it was considering importing more supplies in the short-term from norway and the netherlands . others are also cautioning that in future germany would also have to look at alternative transport routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building of the north european gas pipeline is a controversial project rainer seele , head of wingas told the rheinische pos t that the gas dispute underlined the importance of an additional route such as the planned north european gas pipeline that will link the massive russian gas fields with germany under the baltic sea . with it , germany and europe would achieve " independence from political instability , " seele said . conflict could drag on so far , the row between russia and moscow shows no signs of abating . moscow has threatened ukraine that it will completely turn off the gas taps , while ukraine has countered that it will stop its territory from being used as a gas transit . at the heart of the conflict is gazprom 's demand that ukraine start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians protest against russian gas demands in kiev , the government says the russian demand is tantamount to economic pressure and a political disciplinary measure for its orange revolution last year and ukraine 's increasing pro-western stance . as proof , ukraine points to the fact that pro-moscow nations such as belarus will also in future be charged significantly less for russian gas . the chances for solving the tangle appear bleak .
according to ukrainian sources , the dispute will likely drag on until march when parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in kiev . talks failure may not be so bad after all from a western point of view , this would be the worst option since an interruption of gas supplies will be unavoidable .
in addition to germany , several other western european countries would be affected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder and russian leader putin are the best of chums so far , germany 's close relations to russia when it comes to gas and oil have always been viewed as secure .
but the row between moscow and kiev makes it clear how fragile this supply line is and particularly , how dangerous the increasing fixation on big suppliers - in this case russia - is for germany and europe . considering all this , a failure of russian-ukrainian gas negotiations may not be such a bad thing - it might work as a shock and a trigger for a restructuring of german and european energy policy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine , russia in search of 11th-hour deal on gas dispute russia and ukraine have moved to settle a rancorous dispute on gas prices , ahead of a threat by russian state-run gas giant gazprom to cut off deliveries to ukraine by jan .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .

he negotiated the release of german tourists held hostage in the sahara in 2003 . born on jan .
28 , 1948 in berlin , chrobog studied law in freiburg , aix-en-provence and göttingen .
in 1972 , he switched to the diplomatic corps and headed the offices of then foreign minister walter scheel and his successor , hans-dietrich genscher . he represented germany at the united nations in new york , later in singapore and at the european union in brussels .
he was german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 . chrobog then returned to germany to serve as foreign minister joschka fischer 's deputy and gained a reputation as a careful and gifted crisis manager - someone who could deal with the toughest of tasks . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . his biggest challenge came in april 2003 , when as deputy foreign minister he led an emergency task force charged with resolving the kidnapping of 15 european tourists - nine of whom were german - in the sahara desert .
one hostage died during her captivity , but the others were freed six months later thanks to chrobog 's tenacious negotiations and good contacts . alternatives to ransom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european tourists arrive in germany in august 2003 after being kidnapped in the sahara there was speculation later about how high a ransom germany paid for the release of the hostages .
but chrobog made clear that the issue of ransom had no place in the public debate over the kidnappings . questioned by journalists shortly before his trip to yemen , chrobog was categorical .
" you know if we talked about a ransom and explained that we were paying it all over the place , then we would invite it , " chrobog said .
" we ca n't do that .
it 's highly dangerous .
and besides , ransom is n't at the center of such negotiations . " instead , he stressed , there are alternatives to paying a ransom . " lots of patience , negotiations , long drawn out negotiations .
the hostage-taking in algeria lasted six months .
i was under unbelievable public pressure to come up with a quick solution , " chrobog said .
" but you ca n't just do that .
military , police deployments are n't possible .
you can only negotiate .
all possible contacts are useful .
patience , patience , patience .
there is no other recipe . " since his retirement in mid-2005 , chroborg has acted as chairman of the supervisory board at the bmw foundation herbert quandt . it remains to be seen whether the 65-year-old chrobog 's long experience with crisis-management will stand him in good stead during his own kidnapping in yemen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2005 ukraine , russia in search of 11th-hour deal on gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hiss and sizzle over gas prices between moscow and kiev has reached a new pitch russia and ukraine have moved to settle a rancorous dispute on gas prices , ahead of a threat by russian state-run gas giant gazprom to cut off deliveries to ukraine by jan .
1 if no agreement is reached . ukraine 's energy minister arrived in moscow on wednesday for further negotiations on gazprom 's demand that ukraine begin immediately paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . " unacceptable " russian stance prior to dispatching his energy minister , ivan plachkov , to moscow , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko chaired a meeting with prime minister yury yekhanurov , plachkov and other officials in the capital kiev . gazprom has said it wants ukraine to start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators protest against moscow 's demand speaking at a cabinet meeting in kiev , yekhanurov described a price of $ 230 as " unacceptable , " interfax news agency reported . " this is direct economic pressure on the country .
this is not a market approach , and the ball remains in gazprom 's court , " he said . " legally ignorant " the ukrainian prime minister sparked a storm of protest from moscow on tuesday when he asserted that ukraine had an automatic right under existing accords to take 15 percent of all russian gas that transits through the pipeline network on ukrainian territory . gazprom quickly slammed that assertion as " irresponsible and legally ignorant , " while russia 's influential industry and energy minister , viktor khristenko , called it " surprising , at the very least " and said ukraine had no automatic right to any russian gas . hopes of a compromise the dispute has produced increasingly colorful and testy exchanges between the two sides in recent days , but analysts forecast that despite all the sound and fury as the jan .
1 deadline approached , a compromise deal would be found . " we believe there will be an eleventh hour compromise between russia and ukraine on the gas price issue , " brokerage firm renaissance capital said in its daily market commentary . " we expect gazprom to achieve a higher price relative to 2005 , and it will be a price that ukraine has the ability to pay , " renaissance capital said .
it described the price range being sought by gazprom as " plainly absurd . " ukraine has long benefited from cheap russian gas and gazprom , noting that the european union earlier this month formally recognized ukraine as a " market economy , " said it was under no obligation to continue giving kiev the preferential treatment meted out to some other ex-soviet republics . " a traitor to ukraine " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant tymoshenko has weighed in the gas dispute meanwhile , ukraine 's fiery former prime minister and one-time powerful businesswoman in the gas sector , yulia tymoshenko , offered to help negotiate a deal with russia but said kiev had a right to the cheap gas and should not agree to any higher price . any official who signed a higher price deal with gazprom would be " a traitor to ukraine , " said tymoshenko , who remains a powerful political voice in the country and who is trying to position herself and her party ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in the country next march . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

1 if no agreement is reached . ukraine 's energy minister arrived in moscow on wednesday for further negotiations on gazprom 's demand that ukraine begin immediately paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . " unacceptable " russian stance prior to dispatching his energy minister , ivan plachkov , to moscow , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko chaired a meeting with prime minister yury yekhanurov , plachkov and other officials in the capital kiev . gazprom has said it wants ukraine to start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators protest against moscow 's demand speaking at a cabinet meeting in kiev , yekhanurov described a price of $ 230 as " unacceptable , " interfax news agency reported . " this is direct economic pressure on the country .
this is not a market approach , and the ball remains in gazprom 's court , " he said . " legally ignorant " the ukrainian prime minister sparked a storm of protest from moscow on tuesday when he asserted that ukraine had an automatic right under existing accords to take 15 percent of all russian gas that transits through the pipeline network on ukrainian territory . gazprom quickly slammed that assertion as " irresponsible and legally ignorant , " while russia 's influential industry and energy minister , viktor khristenko , called it " surprising , at the very least " and said ukraine had no automatic right to any russian gas . hopes of a compromise the dispute has produced increasingly colorful and testy exchanges between the two sides in recent days , but analysts forecast that despite all the sound and fury as the jan .
1 deadline approached , a compromise deal would be found . " we believe there will be an eleventh hour compromise between russia and ukraine on the gas price issue , " brokerage firm renaissance capital said in its daily market commentary . " we expect gazprom to achieve a higher price relative to 2005 , and it will be a price that ukraine has the ability to pay , " renaissance capital said .
it described the price range being sought by gazprom as " plainly absurd . " ukraine has long benefited from cheap russian gas and gazprom , noting that the european union earlier this month formally recognized ukraine as a " market economy , " said it was under no obligation to continue giving kiev the preferential treatment meted out to some other ex-soviet republics .

1 , is an economic heavyweight when it comes to linking the developing eastern and more prosperous western halves of europe . hannes androsch , a former austrian finance minister who is now a businessman dealing with eastern europe , told afp : " what meant a lot to us was the annus mirabilis when the cold war came to an end " and barriers fell to trade with former soviet bloc states . this meant that the " logic of geography " was restored for austria , once the center of the pre-world war i austrian-hungarian empire and smack in the middle of europe , bordering italy , switzerland and germany to the west and slovenia , hungary , slovakia and the czech republic to the east . " we took great advantage of this fundamental change that occurred in 1989-90 -lrb- when the iron curtain fell -rrb- and are also doing the same after enlargement -lrb- of the european union in 2004 -rrb- , " androsch said . austria is the largest foreign investor in former communist states romania and bulgaria , as well as much of the former yugoslavia . austrian firms investing in former soviet states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian oil company omv has bought into the east european oil industry austrian firms are buying up bank , insurance , oil , telecommunications and other companies throughout the old soviet bloc .
takeovers have included erste bank 's acquisition of romanian bank banco comerciala romana and oil company omv 's purchase of its romanian rival petrom . friedrich mostböck , head of research for erste bank , said that " looking at austria 's equity market , more than 80 percent of the business is with central and eastern european companies . "
and that business is profitable .
average earnings growth for firms listed on the austrian stock exchange was 72.8 percent in 2005 , he said . mostböck said austrian companies " invested a lot in the -lrb- former communist -rrb- region in 1989 , when the iron curtain fell , and are now gaining a lot out of the region .

2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 .

1 , austria hopes to revive europe by infusing the debate about the eu constitution , enlargement and budget with " energy and confidence . " six years after eu members in feb .
2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2005 russian-ukrainian gas dispute may affect germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reverberations of the gas row are being felt as far away as germany the fractious row between moscow and kiev over gas prices could have serious implications for western europe , which depends on russia for 80 percent of its gas imports .
it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .
for months , the two sides have been wrangling about new pricing for gas supplies and transit rights . russia wants ukraine to immediately begin paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies heavily on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . old contracts governing russian state-run giant gazprom 's gas supplies to and via ukraine to customers in europe run out on dec .
31 .
if russia and ukraine fail to reach a compromise by then , things could turn distinctly frosty - not just between moscow and kiev , but also in germany which relies on russia for 35 percent of its gas supplies . no reason for panic , as yet energy experts in germany are n't hitting the panic button as yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are confident that supplies within germany wo n't run out soon " germany can be supplied for more than two month from gas storage tanks , " martin weyand , head of the federal association of german gas and water economy -lrb- bgw -rrb- pointed out this week . it 's estimated that the largest gas storage tank belonging to kassel-based energy company wingas could supply two million households for a year with gas . even e.on ruhrgas has made adequate arrangements to avoid any supply bottlenecks , according to e.on ruhrgas boss burckhard bergmann . long-drawn out crisis could hit supplies at the same time , experts warn that things could turn dire if supplies are cut off too long . " if the crisis continues for too long and the winter is tough , then we have our limits too , " bergmann said . daily rheinische post reported that essen-based e.on ruhrgas was feverishly working on tackling possible crisis scenarios and that it was considering importing more supplies in the short-term from norway and the netherlands . others are also cautioning that in future germany would also have to look at alternative transport routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building of the north european gas pipeline is a controversial project rainer seele , head of wingas told the rheinische pos t that the gas dispute underlined the importance of an additional route such as the planned north european gas pipeline that will link the massive russian gas fields with germany under the baltic sea . with it , germany and europe would achieve " independence from political instability , " seele said . conflict could drag on so far , the row between russia and moscow shows no signs of abating . moscow has threatened ukraine that it will completely turn off the gas taps , while ukraine has countered that it will stop its territory from being used as a gas transit . at the heart of the conflict is gazprom 's demand that ukraine start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians protest against russian gas demands in kiev , the government says the russian demand is tantamount to economic pressure and a political disciplinary measure for its orange revolution last year and ukraine 's increasing pro-western stance . as proof , ukraine points to the fact that pro-moscow nations such as belarus will also in future be charged significantly less for russian gas . the chances for solving the tangle appear bleak .
according to ukrainian sources , the dispute will likely drag on until march when parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in kiev . talks failure may not be so bad after all from a western point of view , this would be the worst option since an interruption of gas supplies will be unavoidable .
in addition to germany , several other western european countries would be affected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder and russian leader putin are the best of chums so far , germany 's close relations to russia when it comes to gas and oil have always been viewed as secure .
but the row between moscow and kiev makes it clear how fragile this supply line is and particularly , how dangerous the increasing fixation on big suppliers - in this case russia - is for germany and europe . considering all this , a failure of russian-ukrainian gas negotiations may not be such a bad thing - it might work as a shock and a trigger for a restructuring of german and european energy policy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine , russia in search of 11th-hour deal on gas dispute russia and ukraine have moved to settle a rancorous dispute on gas prices , ahead of a threat by russian state-run gas giant gazprom to cut off deliveries to ukraine by jan .

he negotiated the release of german tourists held hostage in the sahara in 2003 . born on jan .
28 , 1948 in berlin , chrobog studied law in freiburg , aix-en-provence and göttingen .
in 1972 , he switched to the diplomatic corps and headed the offices of then foreign minister walter scheel and his successor , hans-dietrich genscher . he represented germany at the united nations in new york , later in singapore and at the european union in brussels .
he was german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 . chrobog then returned to germany to serve as foreign minister joschka fischer 's deputy and gained a reputation as a careful and gifted crisis manager - someone who could deal with the toughest of tasks . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . his biggest challenge came in april 2003 , when as deputy foreign minister he led an emergency task force charged with resolving the kidnapping of 15 european tourists - nine of whom were german - in the sahara desert .
one hostage died during her captivity , but the others were freed six months later thanks to chrobog 's tenacious negotiations and good contacts . alternatives to ransom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european tourists arrive in germany in august 2003 after being kidnapped in the sahara there was speculation later about how high a ransom germany paid for the release of the hostages .
but chrobog made clear that the issue of ransom had no place in the public debate over the kidnappings . questioned by journalists shortly before his trip to yemen , chrobog was categorical .
" you know if we talked about a ransom and explained that we were paying it all over the place , then we would invite it , " chrobog said .
" we ca n't do that .
it 's highly dangerous .
and besides , ransom is n't at the center of such negotiations . " instead , he stressed , there are alternatives to paying a ransom . " lots of patience , negotiations , long drawn out negotiations .
the hostage-taking in algeria lasted six months .
i was under unbelievable public pressure to come up with a quick solution , " chrobog said .
" but you ca n't just do that .
military , police deployments are n't possible .
you can only negotiate .
all possible contacts are useful .
patience , patience , patience .
there is no other recipe . " since his retirement in mid-2005 , chroborg has acted as chairman of the supervisory board at the bmw foundation herbert quandt . it remains to be seen whether the 65-year-old chrobog 's long experience with crisis-management will stand him in good stead during his own kidnapping in yemen .
it 's unclear whether the kidnappers are even aware of the identity of their hostage . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de officials hope to free hostages in yemen soon yemeni authorities say they are hopeful of a speedy release of a kidnapped former high-ranking german official and his family seized by tribesmen in the eastern part of the country .

" they will be freed safely and soon , " a government official told reuters , adding that authorities were still in contact with the al-abdullah tribe which the kidnappers belong to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tribesman want to pressure the government in sana to release prisoners the family of five was abducted from a restaurant on the road to the southern port city of aden in the shabwa region , 480 kilometers -lrb- 300 miles -rrb- east of the capital sana , yemeni authorities confirmed . no politically-motived act reports said chrobog and his family were guests of the yemeni junior foreign minister , who is a former ambassador to germany .
authorities have ruled out a politically-motivated kidnapping . one of the kidnappers told reuters on wednesday that the lives of the family - captured to put pressure on sana to release five tribesmen in jail on criminal charges including murder - would be at risk if yemen used force to free them . the yemeni interior ministry is reported to know where the kidnappers are holding the hostages , and have said the area will be sealed off by security forces by thursday afternoon . hostages said to be well german authorities confirmed the disappearance of chrobog - who served as german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 - and his family in yemen late wednesday , but initially declined to say whether they had been kidnapped . the german government was in touch with all the relevant authorities in yemen and were hoping for a swift release of chrobog and his family , said foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger in berlin .
the government has set up an emergency task force . " we will concentrate all our efforts on bringing this family back to security as soon as possible , " he said . chrobog was expected to be freed by the afternoon , german public television broadcaster ard reported thursday , without naming any sources .
a middle east correspondent for the broadcaster said he had personally spoken to chrobog and his family and confirmed they were well . a gifted crisis manager himself chrobog , 65 , served as deputy foreign ministry under former chancellor gerhard schröder and was seen as a gifted crisis manager . ironically , he helped secure the release of 14 german tourists taken hostage in mali in august 2003 . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . as is customary in yemen 's bandit-ridden region , the german tourists had been given soldiers to accompany their convoy of two vehicles , but the kidnappers were took advantage of the break for a meal to take the family hostage . a matter of hours or days , says tour group " they have been getting things to eat and to drink , more than what you might expect , " said a representative from the local tour agency abu taleb group -lrb- atg -rrb- , a partner of the german studiosus group .
" this is an affair of hours , at most days . " it was the fourth abduction of foreign tourists in yemen this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists visiting remote areas of yemen are particularly at risk last week , two austrian tourists were held hostage for three days in the eastern maarib region .
in november , two swiss holidaymakers were briefly held by tribesmen in the same area .
and in august , three spaniards were abducted in the south before being released unharmed . despite its proximity to oil-rich saudi arabia , yemen is one of the world 's poorest countries and more than 200 foreigners have been kidnapped in the past decade . nearly all of the kidnappings have been carried out by tribesmen seeking to put pressure on the central government and the hostages have generally been released unharmed . but in december 1998 , three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants were killed when security forces stormed their hideout . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany relieved by freeing of hostage , but questions remain germany rejoiced following the freeing of hostage susanne osthoff and her driver in iraq after more than three weeks in captivity .

he negotiated the release of german tourists held hostage in the sahara in 2003 . born on jan .
28 , 1948 in berlin , chrobog studied law in freiburg , aix-en-provence and göttingen .
in 1972 , he switched to the diplomatic corps and headed the offices of then foreign minister walter scheel and his successor , hans-dietrich genscher . he represented germany at the united nations in new york , later in singapore and at the european union in brussels .
he was german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 . chrobog then returned to germany to serve as foreign minister joschka fischer 's deputy and gained a reputation as a careful and gifted crisis manager - someone who could deal with the toughest of tasks . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . his biggest challenge came in april 2003 , when as deputy foreign minister he led an emergency task force charged with resolving the kidnapping of 15 european tourists - nine of whom were german - in the sahara desert .
one hostage died during her captivity , but the others were freed six months later thanks to chrobog 's tenacious negotiations and good contacts . alternatives to ransom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european tourists arrive in germany in august 2003 after being kidnapped in the sahara there was speculation later about how high a ransom germany paid for the release of the hostages .
but chrobog made clear that the issue of ransom had no place in the public debate over the kidnappings . questioned by journalists shortly before his trip to yemen , chrobog was categorical .
" you know if we talked about a ransom and explained that we were paying it all over the place , then we would invite it , " chrobog said .
" we ca n't do that .
it 's highly dangerous .
and besides , ransom is n't at the center of such negotiations . " instead , he stressed , there are alternatives to paying a ransom . " lots of patience , negotiations , long drawn out negotiations .
the hostage-taking in algeria lasted six months .
i was under unbelievable public pressure to come up with a quick solution , " chrobog said .
" but you ca n't just do that .
military , police deployments are n't possible .
you can only negotiate .
all possible contacts are useful .
patience , patience , patience .
there is no other recipe . " since his retirement in mid-2005 , chroborg has acted as chairman of the supervisory board at the bmw foundation herbert quandt . it remains to be seen whether the 65-year-old chrobog 's long experience with crisis-management will stand him in good stead during his own kidnapping in yemen .
it 's unclear whether the kidnappers are even aware of the identity of their hostage . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de officials hope to free hostages in yemen soon yemeni authorities say they are hopeful of a speedy release of a kidnapped former high-ranking german official and his family seized by tribesmen in the eastern part of the country .

it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .
for months , the two sides have been wrangling about new pricing for gas supplies and transit rights . russia wants ukraine to immediately begin paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies heavily on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . old contracts governing russian state-run giant gazprom 's gas supplies to and via ukraine to customers in europe run out on dec .

1 , austria hopes to revive europe by infusing the debate about the eu constitution , enlargement and budget with " energy and confidence . " six years after eu members in feb .
2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 . " as far as the constitution is concerned , i do n't think that we can succeed with cosmetic changes only .
that would not do justice to the great importance of this topic , " said plassnik . european model of life apart from institutional tools , one needs to define the " european model of life , " which guarantees jobs and growth - both of which will be on the council 's agenda in march - as well as environmental protection and europe 's place in the world , plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plassnik will be integral in the accession talks with bulgaria and romania in addition to backing the so-called " bolkestein " directive on liberalizing services and the european directive on work hours , austria will emphasize eu enlargement as one of its top priorities . as a bridge between east and west , austria will be looking to stabilize the balkans in the name of the " european peace project , " said plassnik , who is personally involved in eu accession talks with croatia .
austria will also be steering the entry of bulgaria and romania into the eu , set for 2007 . in early october , austria , whose population is largely opposed to turkey 's entry into the eu , tried to block an agreement by the 25 members on the framework of accession talks with turkey , but finally gave in under pressure from its partners . plassnik added " there is no reason to have any suspicions " about austria 's disposition towards turkey . radical changes ? the austrian presidency will also have to strike a compromise with the commission and the parliament on the eu 's 2007-2013 budget after the european council reached a last-minute agreement on dec .

we can now concentrate on things which are more important for our citizens : namely , growth and more jobs , " barroso told deutsche welle . lastly , austria will suggest the creation of a european human rights agency in vienna . austria , which entered the eu in 1995 , had previously held the presidency , in the second half of 1998 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2005 al qaeda responsible for kidnap says freed hostage osthoff großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff also denied reports that she was considering returning to iraq amid confusing and contradictory remarks about her capture and alleged return to iraq , former german hostage susanne osthoff claimed that a group affiliated to al qaeda was behind her kidnapping . susanne osthoff , the german archeologist who was abducted in iraq and released after 24 days in captivity , has said a group linked to al qaeda 's leader in iraq , abu musab al zarqawi , was behind her kidnapping last month , as a report thursday said she is planning to return to the country . " i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .
al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional . " electronic ankle bracelets would be practical for islamic militants who threaten german society , but whom we can not return to their home countries because they might be tortured there , " said .
schünemann . " if they leave these areas , there would be a warning signal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .

the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .

why not !
winter on the popular beach resort of sylt means icy grey waters under a dark sky , bracing sea air , heavy surf - and above all , more calm than in summer . for germans , sylt is synonymous with chic .
in summer , the expensive , exclusive beach resort is a playground for the rich and famous , where getting away from it all combines nicely with seeing and being seen . in the winter , however , life on sylt is another story altogether .
in the off-season , the largest of the north sea islands , which lies off the coast of germany at the danish border , all but empties out , leaving raw nature behind .
sylt in winter is a meditative and healthy oasis - for those who think to take advantage of it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sylt used to be more of a hot spot for celebrities winter visitors to sylt wo n't find themselves entirely alone , however . first off , there are the health-spa visitors .
the bracing sea air - rich in iodine - is considered helpful against numerous ailments from heart disease to skin irritations , and doctors prescribe trips to health spas on sylt in winter and summer alike . in addition to the spa-goers , there are second-home owners , people on winter holidays , and , of course , day trippers . birth of tourism many of the day trippers come from denmark , and indeed it was a dane who , legend has it , was the first to bathe on the island .
in 1842 , denmark ’ s king christian viii notoriously stripped down to swim in the waters of the westerland beach , which had yet to become a popular resort . in fact , at the time , there was neither a restaurant nor a hotel on the island .
but in 1855 , a nobleman named von levetzow built wooden bathing cabanas in westerland , now the island 's capital .
thus , tourism was born on sylt . the island is germany ’ s northernmost outpost .

in the off-season , the largest of the north sea islands , which lies off the coast of germany at the danish border , all but empties out , leaving raw nature behind .
sylt in winter is a meditative and healthy oasis - for those who think to take advantage of it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sylt used to be more of a hot spot for celebrities winter visitors to sylt wo n't find themselves entirely alone , however . first off , there are the health-spa visitors .
the bracing sea air - rich in iodine - is considered helpful against numerous ailments from heart disease to skin irritations , and doctors prescribe trips to health spas on sylt in winter and summer alike . in addition to the spa-goers , there are second-home owners , people on winter holidays , and , of course , day trippers . birth of tourism many of the day trippers come from denmark , and indeed it was a dane who , legend has it , was the first to bathe on the island .
in 1842 , denmark ’ s king christian viii notoriously stripped down to swim in the waters of the westerland beach , which had yet to become a popular resort . in fact , at the time , there was neither a restaurant nor a hotel on the island .
but in 1855 , a nobleman named von levetzow built wooden bathing cabanas in westerland , now the island 's capital .
thus , tourism was born on sylt . the island is germany ’ s northernmost outpost .
it is the largest island of the fresian archipelago , which stretches from denmark to the netherlands .
today , the island has seven townships and twelve towns , with a total of 21,500 inhabitants and some 12,500 second-home owners . there are 50,000 beds on the island , mostly in holiday apartments . every year , the island is visited by 600,000 tourists , who , altogether , stay for more than five million nights . island hamlets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the winter , you wo n't have to fight the crowds for over a century , fresians have been known for their thatched roofs , and the hamlet of kampen has its share .
but in contrast to the town 's quaint looks , it became known in the 1960s and 70s for its high concentration of prominent visitors , including media stars , artists and intellectuals .
for a decade or two , the island had a reputation for decadence - it was often called the " home of the rich and the naked " - but the social extravagance has calmed down in recent years . westerland is the largest town on the island , with some 9,000 inhabitants .
it has 19,000 guest beds , a promenade , a health spa , casino , and several less-than-attractive apartment blocks : the lovely old villas and traditional fresian homes were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s . home of the sea captains no one can dispute the fact that the town of keitum is the loveliest hamlet on the island .
the many original thatch-roofed houses are surrounded by a rich variety of trees : elm , ash , oak , birch , chestnut . the local history museum offers a pleasant viewing of the nature and history of the island . at its beginnings , keitum was the home of the sea captains who travelled the world on massive expeditions , which often made them rich .
in turn they built fancy homes , and the " altfriesische haus , " or old fresian house , is a living museum that shows how life was lived on sylt in the 18th century . also worth a visit is the 13th century , late-roman church st. severin .
the door handles are shaped like whales , and a romantic baptismal font , a renaissance pulpit and a carved altar from the late gothic period are also worth a look . if you are really seeking quiet , the agricultural hamlet of archsum is worth looking into .
it has the island 's oldest church , with a baptismal font dating from the 13th century .
rantum , with its many thatched houses , is the island 's smallest town . ties to england one of the joys of the winter visit is to walk along the water , enjoying the stiff ocean winds and the salty spray on the skin .
but even nicer yet is getting out of the cold .
part of the art of warming up on sylt is enjoying a hot cup of tea . unlike in the rest of germany , where coffee is the drink of choice , the fresians - who have long enjoyed both trading and cultural kinship with the british - opt for a steaming cup of tea .
typically , this is drunk with candied sugar and milk that is poured in , but never stirred . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de windy energy in the sea germany is the world ’ s leading producer of wind power .

" i have often been asked in recent weeks and months why i want to govern this country with all the problems before us , " she wrote .
" i always reply : because i believe in this country and its people !
because germany is full of opportunities and i am convinced that we can seize them . "
targeting joblessness she said the top priority remained driving down the unemployment rate , currently hovering at 10.9 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people line up for public assistance " i can not accept that we can not find work for so many men and women in our country who are willing to work , " merkel wrote , noting that the government had already launched an initiative to make hiring cheaper and more attractive . " let 's surprise ourselves with how much is possible , and what we can achieve , " she wrote in an appeal for the populace to overcome what is often written about as a general lethargy and negative attitude towards change .
" we need people to be ready to make changes . " families first she said she would also focus government efforts to revive economic growth , calling it the only way to ensure the sanctity of the country 's cherished social welfare system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is promising support for families with chilren merkel noted the government had earmarked 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- to stimulate the economy and create jobs , including funding for infrastructure improvements and research and development . the government will also zero in on germany 's mounting demographic problems , caused by the low birthrate and an aging population , merkel wrote . " we want to make it easier for parents to care for the children .
only if our country is strong and our economy is competitive can we help all those who need our help . " a positive start merkel , who only narrowly beat former leader gerhard schroeder in the september general election , is widely seen as off to a good start as chancellor and has watched her poll ratings steadily climb since taking office . it cost the government 2.95 million euros to publish the letter in magazines and regional and national newspapers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans .

i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .
for months , the two sides have been wrangling about new pricing for gas supplies and transit rights . russia wants ukraine to immediately begin paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies heavily on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . old contracts governing russian state-run giant gazprom 's gas supplies to and via ukraine to customers in europe run out on dec .
31 .
if russia and ukraine fail to reach a compromise by then , things could turn distinctly frosty - not just between moscow and kiev , but also in germany which relies on russia for 35 percent of its gas supplies . no reason for panic , as yet energy experts in germany are n't hitting the panic button as yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are confident that supplies within germany wo n't run out soon " germany can be supplied for more than two month from gas storage tanks , " martin weyand , head of the federal association of german gas and water economy -lrb- bgw -rrb- pointed out this week . it 's estimated that the largest gas storage tank belonging to kassel-based energy company wingas could supply two million households for a year with gas . even e.on ruhrgas has made adequate arrangements to avoid any supply bottlenecks , according to e.on ruhrgas boss burckhard bergmann . long-drawn out crisis could hit supplies at the same time , experts warn that things could turn dire if supplies are cut off too long . " if the crisis continues for too long and the winter is tough , then we have our limits too , " bergmann said . daily rheinische post reported that essen-based e.on ruhrgas was feverishly working on tackling possible crisis scenarios and that it was considering importing more supplies in the short-term from norway and the netherlands . others are also cautioning that in future germany would also have to look at alternative transport routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building of the north european gas pipeline is a controversial project rainer seele , head of wingas told the rheinische pos t that the gas dispute underlined the importance of an additional route such as the planned north european gas pipeline that will link the massive russian gas fields with germany under the baltic sea . with it , germany and europe would achieve " independence from political instability , " seele said . conflict could drag on so far , the row between russia and moscow shows no signs of abating . moscow has threatened ukraine that it will completely turn off the gas taps , while ukraine has countered that it will stop its territory from being used as a gas transit . at the heart of the conflict is gazprom 's demand that ukraine start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians protest against russian gas demands in kiev , the government says the russian demand is tantamount to economic pressure and a political disciplinary measure for its orange revolution last year and ukraine 's increasing pro-western stance . as proof , ukraine points to the fact that pro-moscow nations such as belarus will also in future be charged significantly less for russian gas . the chances for solving the tangle appear bleak .
according to ukrainian sources , the dispute will likely drag on until march when parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in kiev . talks failure may not be so bad after all from a western point of view , this would be the worst option since an interruption of gas supplies will be unavoidable .
in addition to germany , several other western european countries would be affected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder and russian leader putin are the best of chums so far , germany 's close relations to russia when it comes to gas and oil have always been viewed as secure .
but the row between moscow and kiev makes it clear how fragile this supply line is and particularly , how dangerous the increasing fixation on big suppliers - in this case russia - is for germany and europe . considering all this , a failure of russian-ukrainian gas negotiations may not be such a bad thing - it might work as a shock and a trigger for a restructuring of german and european energy policy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine , russia in search of 11th-hour deal on gas dispute russia and ukraine have moved to settle a rancorous dispute on gas prices , ahead of a threat by russian state-run gas giant gazprom to cut off deliveries to ukraine by jan .

" i have often been asked in recent weeks and months why i want to govern this country with all the problems before us , " she wrote .
" i always reply : because i believe in this country and its people !

" we want to make it easier for parents to care for the children .
only if our country is strong and our economy is competitive can we help all those who need our help . " a positive start merkel , who only narrowly beat former leader gerhard schroeder in the september general election , is widely seen as off to a good start as chancellor and has watched her poll ratings steadily climb since taking office . it cost the government 2.95 million euros to publish the letter in magazines and regional and national newspapers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .
for months , the two sides have been wrangling about new pricing for gas supplies and transit rights . russia wants ukraine to immediately begin paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies heavily on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . old contracts governing russian state-run giant gazprom 's gas supplies to and via ukraine to customers in europe run out on dec .

if russia and ukraine fail to reach a compromise by then , things could turn distinctly frosty - not just between moscow and kiev , but also in germany which relies on russia for 35 percent of its gas supplies . no reason for panic , as yet energy experts in germany are n't hitting the panic button as yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are confident that supplies within germany wo n't run out soon " germany can be supplied for more than two month from gas storage tanks , " martin weyand , head of the federal association of german gas and water economy -lrb- bgw -rrb- pointed out this week . it 's estimated that the largest gas storage tank belonging to kassel-based energy company wingas could supply two million households for a year with gas . even e.on ruhrgas has made adequate arrangements to avoid any supply bottlenecks , according to e.on ruhrgas boss burckhard bergmann . long-drawn out crisis could hit supplies at the same time , experts warn that things could turn dire if supplies are cut off too long . " if the crisis continues for too long and the winter is tough , then we have our limits too , " bergmann said . daily rheinische post reported that essen-based e.on ruhrgas was feverishly working on tackling possible crisis scenarios and that it was considering importing more supplies in the short-term from norway and the netherlands . others are also cautioning that in future germany would also have to look at alternative transport routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building of the north european gas pipeline is a controversial project rainer seele , head of wingas told the rheinische pos t that the gas dispute underlined the importance of an additional route such as the planned north european gas pipeline that will link the massive russian gas fields with germany under the baltic sea . with it , germany and europe would achieve " independence from political instability , " seele said . conflict could drag on so far , the row between russia and moscow shows no signs of abating . moscow has threatened ukraine that it will completely turn off the gas taps , while ukraine has countered that it will stop its territory from being used as a gas transit . at the heart of the conflict is gazprom 's demand that ukraine start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians protest against russian gas demands in kiev , the government says the russian demand is tantamount to economic pressure and a political disciplinary measure for its orange revolution last year and ukraine 's increasing pro-western stance . as proof , ukraine points to the fact that pro-moscow nations such as belarus will also in future be charged significantly less for russian gas . the chances for solving the tangle appear bleak .
according to ukrainian sources , the dispute will likely drag on until march when parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in kiev . talks failure may not be so bad after all from a western point of view , this would be the worst option since an interruption of gas supplies will be unavoidable .

if russia and ukraine fail to reach a compromise by then , things could turn distinctly frosty - not just between moscow and kiev , but also in germany which relies on russia for 35 percent of its gas supplies . no reason for panic , as yet energy experts in germany are n't hitting the panic button as yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are confident that supplies within germany wo n't run out soon " germany can be supplied for more than two month from gas storage tanks , " martin weyand , head of the federal association of german gas and water economy -lrb- bgw -rrb- pointed out this week . it 's estimated that the largest gas storage tank belonging to kassel-based energy company wingas could supply two million households for a year with gas . even e.on ruhrgas has made adequate arrangements to avoid any supply bottlenecks , according to e.on ruhrgas boss burckhard bergmann . long-drawn out crisis could hit supplies at the same time , experts warn that things could turn dire if supplies are cut off too long . " if the crisis continues for too long and the winter is tough , then we have our limits too , " bergmann said . daily rheinische post reported that essen-based e.on ruhrgas was feverishly working on tackling possible crisis scenarios and that it was considering importing more supplies in the short-term from norway and the netherlands . others are also cautioning that in future germany would also have to look at alternative transport routes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the building of the north european gas pipeline is a controversial project rainer seele , head of wingas told the rheinische pos t that the gas dispute underlined the importance of an additional route such as the planned north european gas pipeline that will link the massive russian gas fields with germany under the baltic sea . with it , germany and europe would achieve " independence from political instability , " seele said . conflict could drag on so far , the row between russia and moscow shows no signs of abating . moscow has threatened ukraine that it will completely turn off the gas taps , while ukraine has countered that it will stop its territory from being used as a gas transit . at the heart of the conflict is gazprom 's demand that ukraine start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainians protest against russian gas demands in kiev , the government says the russian demand is tantamount to economic pressure and a political disciplinary measure for its orange revolution last year and ukraine 's increasing pro-western stance . as proof , ukraine points to the fact that pro-moscow nations such as belarus will also in future be charged significantly less for russian gas . the chances for solving the tangle appear bleak .
according to ukrainian sources , the dispute will likely drag on until march when parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in kiev . talks failure may not be so bad after all from a western point of view , this would be the worst option since an interruption of gas supplies will be unavoidable .
in addition to germany , several other western european countries would be affected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor schröder and russian leader putin are the best of chums so far , germany 's close relations to russia when it comes to gas and oil have always been viewed as secure .
but the row between moscow and kiev makes it clear how fragile this supply line is and particularly , how dangerous the increasing fixation on big suppliers - in this case russia - is for germany and europe . considering all this , a failure of russian-ukrainian gas negotiations may not be such a bad thing - it might work as a shock and a trigger for a restructuring of german and european energy policy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine , russia in search of 11th-hour deal on gas dispute russia and ukraine have moved to settle a rancorous dispute on gas prices , ahead of a threat by russian state-run gas giant gazprom to cut off deliveries to ukraine by jan .

he was german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 . chrobog then returned to germany to serve as foreign minister joschka fischer 's deputy and gained a reputation as a careful and gifted crisis manager - someone who could deal with the toughest of tasks . after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , chrobog traveled to pakistan to negotiate the release of aid workers from the organization shelter now who were held in taliban prisons in afghanistan . his biggest challenge came in april 2003 , when as deputy foreign minister he led an emergency task force charged with resolving the kidnapping of 15 european tourists - nine of whom were german - in the sahara desert .

all possible contacts are useful .
patience , patience , patience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2005 austria preps for challenging eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister plassnik wants a thorough discussion of the eu constitution when it takes over the rotating eu presidency on jan .
1 , austria hopes to revive europe by infusing the debate about the eu constitution , enlargement and budget with " energy and confidence . " six years after eu members in feb .
2000 imposed sanctions on austria for welcoming an far right-wing party into the government , chancellor wolfgang schüssel said the revival of europe will be his country 's main priority during the six-month presidency . the differences between european member states , which became painfully visible after france and the netherlands rejected the european constitution in the spring of 2005 , are likely to present a major challenge to the austrian presidency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu constitution was overwhelmingly rejected by french voters the 25 eu members will have to decide whether to complete the ratification of the constitution and whether to implement some of its measures .
austria is one of the 13 member states that have already ratified the constitution : it did so in may 2005 following an almost unanimous vote in the parliament . " to renew ties with a visionary europe , one must picture a choreography for 25 to address with energy and confidence the pause for thought , " agreed upon by the european council in june 2005 , austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik said . this " pause for thought , " which was formulated after the defeat of the constitution in france and the netherlands , should allow detailed debates on the eu 's future before the european council addresses the revival of the institutions in june 2006 . " as far as the constitution is concerned , i do n't think that we can succeed with cosmetic changes only .
that would not do justice to the great importance of this topic , " said plassnik . european model of life apart from institutional tools , one needs to define the " european model of life , " which guarantees jobs and growth - both of which will be on the council 's agenda in march - as well as environmental protection and europe 's place in the world , plassnik said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plassnik will be integral in the accession talks with bulgaria and romania in addition to backing the so-called " bolkestein " directive on liberalizing services and the european directive on work hours , austria will emphasize eu enlargement as one of its top priorities . as a bridge between east and west , austria will be looking to stabilize the balkans in the name of the " european peace project , " said plassnik , who is personally involved in eu accession talks with croatia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.12.2005 bavaria shuts islamic center , citing dangers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cultural center 's fame spread with el-masri 's abduction amid debate over how best to prevent terrorism while protecting civil liberties , one german state has banned an islamic group , and an official from another state suggested electronically tagging militants authorities in the german state of bavaria banned an islamic group wednesday , after seizing material allegedly inciting muslims to kill jews and christians and carry out suicide attacks in iraq . bavarian interior minister günther beckstein shut down the governing committee of the islamic center multi-kultur-haus .
the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .
al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional . " electronic ankle bracelets would be practical for islamic militants who threaten german society , but whom we can not return to their home countries because they might be tortured there , " said .
schünemann . " if they leave these areas , there would be a warning signal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .
al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional . " electronic ankle bracelets would be practical for islamic militants who threaten german society , but whom we can not return to their home countries because they might be tortured there , " said .
schünemann . " if they leave these areas , there would be a warning signal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

" they will be freed safely and soon , " a government official told reuters , adding that authorities were still in contact with the al-abdullah tribe which the kidnappers belong to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tribesman want to pressure the government in sana to release prisoners the family of five was abducted from a restaurant on the road to the southern port city of aden in the shabwa region , 480 kilometers -lrb- 300 miles -rrb- east of the capital sana , yemeni authorities confirmed . no politically-motived act reports said chrobog and his family were guests of the yemeni junior foreign minister , who is a former ambassador to germany .
authorities have ruled out a politically-motivated kidnapping . one of the kidnappers told reuters on wednesday that the lives of the family - captured to put pressure on sana to release five tribesmen in jail on criminal charges including murder - would be at risk if yemen used force to free them . the yemeni interior ministry is reported to know where the kidnappers are holding the hostages , and have said the area will be sealed off by security forces by thursday afternoon . hostages said to be well german authorities confirmed the disappearance of chrobog - who served as german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 - and his family in yemen late wednesday , but initially declined to say whether they had been kidnapped . the german government was in touch with all the relevant authorities in yemen and were hoping for a swift release of chrobog and his family , said foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger in berlin .
the government has set up an emergency task force . " we will concentrate all our efforts on bringing this family back to security as soon as possible , " he said . chrobog was expected to be freed by the afternoon , german public television broadcaster ard reported thursday , without naming any sources .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .

al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional . " electronic ankle bracelets would be practical for islamic militants who threaten german society , but whom we can not return to their home countries because they might be tortured there , " said .

authorities have ruled out a politically-motivated kidnapping . one of the kidnappers told reuters on wednesday that the lives of the family - captured to put pressure on sana to release five tribesmen in jail on criminal charges including murder - would be at risk if yemen used force to free them . the yemeni interior ministry is reported to know where the kidnappers are holding the hostages , and have said the area will be sealed off by security forces by thursday afternoon . hostages said to be well german authorities confirmed the disappearance of chrobog - who served as german ambassador to the united states from 1995 to 2001 - and his family in yemen late wednesday , but initially declined to say whether they had been kidnapped . the german government was in touch with all the relevant authorities in yemen and were hoping for a swift release of chrobog and his family , said foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger in berlin .

1 if no agreement is reached . ukraine 's energy minister arrived in moscow on wednesday for further negotiations on gazprom 's demand that ukraine begin immediately paying world market rates for gas it receives from russia , instead of the highly subsidized price charged at present under a barter system left over from soviet practices . kiev says it is prepared to pay market rates - and to charge russia market rates for use of the gas pipeline network on ukrainian territory that gazprom relies on to ship gas to customers in europe - but wants the shift to take place gradually over several years . " unacceptable " russian stance prior to dispatching his energy minister , ivan plachkov , to moscow , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko chaired a meeting with prime minister yury yekhanurov , plachkov and other officials in the capital kiev . gazprom has said it wants ukraine to start paying $ 220-230 -lrb- 185-193 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas it receives from russia - roughly the price the russian gas monopoly charges to customers in western europe but more than quadruple the $ 50 ukraine pays at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian demonstrators protest against moscow 's demand speaking at a cabinet meeting in kiev , yekhanurov described a price of $ 230 as " unacceptable , " interfax news agency reported . " this is direct economic pressure on the country .
this is not a market approach , and the ball remains in gazprom 's court , " he said . " legally ignorant " the ukrainian prime minister sparked a storm of protest from moscow on tuesday when he asserted that ukraine had an automatic right under existing accords to take 15 percent of all russian gas that transits through the pipeline network on ukrainian territory . gazprom quickly slammed that assertion as " irresponsible and legally ignorant , " while russia 's influential industry and energy minister , viktor khristenko , called it " surprising , at the very least " and said ukraine had no automatic right to any russian gas . hopes of a compromise the dispute has produced increasingly colorful and testy exchanges between the two sides in recent days , but analysts forecast that despite all the sound and fury as the jan .
1 deadline approached , a compromise deal would be found . " we believe there will be an eleventh hour compromise between russia and ukraine on the gas price issue , " brokerage firm renaissance capital said in its daily market commentary . " we expect gazprom to achieve a higher price relative to 2005 , and it will be a price that ukraine has the ability to pay , " renaissance capital said .
it described the price range being sought by gazprom as " plainly absurd . " ukraine has long benefited from cheap russian gas and gazprom , noting that the european union earlier this month formally recognized ukraine as a " market economy , " said it was under no obligation to continue giving kiev the preferential treatment meted out to some other ex-soviet republics . " a traitor to ukraine " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flamboyant tymoshenko has weighed in the gas dispute meanwhile , ukraine 's fiery former prime minister and one-time powerful businesswoman in the gas sector , yulia tymoshenko , offered to help negotiate a deal with russia but said kiev had a right to the cheap gas and should not agree to any higher price . any official who signed a higher price deal with gazprom would be " a traitor to ukraine , " said tymoshenko , who remains a powerful political voice in the country and who is trying to position herself and her party ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in the country next march . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel takes heat out of russian gas deal in poland seeking to improve relations soured by plans to build a baltic gas pipeline between russia and europe , german chancellor angela merkel has promised she will not go over poland 's head in dealing with moscow .

" i was informed who it was , namely a group linked to abu musab al zarqawi 's group , " osthoff , 43 , told zdf public television about her abduction with her iraqi driver on november 25 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu musab al zarqawi , the head of al qaeda in iraq , has a $ 25 million price on his head osthoff , speaking from doha and dressed in a yashmak or black veil covering all but her eyes , described the psychological terror she experienced during her 24-day captivity .
" you do not have any feelings any more because you are on the verge of death , " osthoff said . osthoff " lucky to be alive " she said that she was kept bound part of the time and that she was lucky to be alive . " if there were no mercy in arabia , i would have been eliminated after an hour in the trunk -lrb- of the kidnappers ' car -rrb- and then tossed in the canal , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid hala , osthoff 's mother , celebrated her daughter 's release but has reportedly not heard directly from her since .
she was freed on december 18 and has reportedly not been in direct contact with her family in germany , who made frequent media appearances during her ordeal to demand her release . the remarks appeared to contradict an interview she gave monday to doha-based satellite channel al jazeera in which she said her kidnappers were not criminals and had only demanded humanitarian aid for sunni arab regions . she had described her captors as " poor people " and that she " can not blame them for kidnapping her , as they can not enter -lrb- baghdad 's heavily fortified -rrb- green zone to kidnap americans . " conflicting reports of osthoff 's future intentions meanwhile , the german daily die welt said that osthoff was currently in jordan and was planning her return to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osthoff has denied remarks about returning to iraq which were accredited to her .
asked by zdf if it was indeed her intention to head for iraq , osthoff replied : " that 's a lie , i have the cassette here ...
i have never said that , i would n't do so to such a dumb question and it has never been asked by the arabs . "
zdf broadcast excerpts from the al jazeera interview , in which osthoff gives few direct answers and digresses at length . the die welt report suggested that if she were to return to iraq then the 900-kilometer -lrb- 560-mile -rrb- journey from amman in jordan to baghdad , notoriously dangerous due to roving bands of thieves and kidnappers , would be avoided and that an alternative would be to enter the country via syria . but the newspaper reported that the government in damascus had said that while osthoff , a muslim convert and fluent arabic speaker , would be welcome in the country she would not be permitted to cross the border into iraq . foreign ministry angered at rumors of a return to iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is said to be livid over reports of osthoff 's return .
speculation that osthoff might return to iraq has met with outrage in germany and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has explicitly called on her not to return to the strife-ravaged country . it is unclear whether germany paid a ransom for her release but many officials have noted the expense of the effort to free her , including the establishment of a round-the-clock crisis team operating at the foreign ministry . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de freed german hostage to return to iraq , despite warnings the german government responded critically to news that susanne osthoff , recently freed from hostage in iraq , was planning to return to the country regardless of berlin 's warnings .

" we want to make it easier for parents to care for the children .
only if our country is strong and our economy is competitive can we help all those who need our help . " a positive start merkel , who only narrowly beat former leader gerhard schroeder in the september general election , is widely seen as off to a good start as chancellor and has watched her poll ratings steadily climb since taking office . it cost the government 2.95 million euros to publish the letter in magazines and regional and national newspapers . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .

it could hit germany hard too . on the surface , the atmosphere at e.on ruhrgas , germany 's largest gas importer , is relaxed .
the gas giant 's top management is , as is the case in most companies at this time of year , on holiday and even the press office is thinly-staffed . but beyond the calm façade , e.on ruhrgas must have its sights firmly on a turbulent dispute unfolding in moscow and kiev .

why not !
winter on the popular beach resort of sylt means icy grey waters under a dark sky , bracing sea air , heavy surf - and above all , more calm than in summer . for germans , sylt is synonymous with chic .
in summer , the expensive , exclusive beach resort is a playground for the rich and famous , where getting away from it all combines nicely with seeing and being seen . in the winter , however , life on sylt is another story altogether .

in 1842 , denmark ’ s king christian viii notoriously stripped down to swim in the waters of the westerland beach , which had yet to become a popular resort . in fact , at the time , there was neither a restaurant nor a hotel on the island .

for a decade or two , the island had a reputation for decadence - it was often called the " home of the rich and the naked " - but the social extravagance has calmed down in recent years . westerland is the largest town on the island , with some 9,000 inhabitants .
it has 19,000 guest beds , a promenade , a health spa , casino , and several less-than-attractive apartment blocks : the lovely old villas and traditional fresian homes were torn down in the 1950s and 1960s . home of the sea captains no one can dispute the fact that the town of keitum is the loveliest hamlet on the island .
the many original thatch-roofed houses are surrounded by a rich variety of trees : elm , ash , oak , birch , chestnut . the local history museum offers a pleasant viewing of the nature and history of the island . at its beginnings , keitum was the home of the sea captains who travelled the world on massive expeditions , which often made them rich .

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .
al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional . " electronic ankle bracelets would be practical for islamic militants who threaten german society , but whom we can not return to their home countries because they might be tortured there , " said .
schünemann . " if they leave these areas , there would be a warning signal , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : in war on terror , how far is too far ?

the move came in the wake of the cia abduction of lebanese-german khaled el-masri , who was known to have frequented the center . the state said the activities of the multi-kultur-haus association , in the city of neu-ulm , threatened the coexistence of germans and foreigners as well as security in the country .
beckstein said the islamic group had openly called for " holy war " and violence against those who did n't share ist beliefs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center was searched in january , when 14 people were arrested on wednesday , beckstein seized the center 's assets and banned its governing body .
it was the latest move against islamists around the towns of neu-ulm and its partner city ulm . death-preaching school books security forces had been observing the multi-kultur-haus for years .
the center had been searched on several previous occasions .
militants from the group had already been deported in february and june , and in september a search of the premises turned up enough material to warrant banning the group , beckstein said .
this included recordings of calls for suicide bombings , and a demand for school books preaching death for non-muslims . beckstein said officials will continue to " keep an eye on " the islamic scene in ulm and neu-ulm , and take measures against the buildup of any organization aiming to replace the multi-kulti-haus and spread its message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günther beckstein " organizations that aggressively try to oppose our constitutional order and openly call for violence will not be tolerated , " beckstein said .
but he added that the searches turned up no concrete plans for attacks . el-masri , a german citizen suing the cia for allegedly kidnapping him and taking him to afghanistan , acknowledged visiting the group 's office .
al-masri 's case has stoked debate about how to prevent terrorist attacks while safeguarding civil liberties . tagging extremists meanwhile , in remarks published wednesday , uwe schünemann , interior minister of lower saxony state , suggested placing electronic tags on foreign extremists who ca n't be deported , to keep them under observation . the move would " allow us to monitor 3,000 potentially dangerous islamists , hate preachers , and people who had been trained in foreign terrorist camps , " schünemann told the newspaper die welt on wednesday he said an electronic ankle bracelet could easily be assimilated into the law pertaining to foreigners , and denied such a move would be unconstitutional . " electronic ankle bracelets would be practical for islamic militants who threaten german society , but whom we can not return to their home countries because they might be tortured there , " said .

the problem used to be dealt with by the dvla but from 6 january , the city council have the power to remove cars .
it says any vehicle parked on public roads , with overdue tax of 28 days or more , can be clamped and removed and the owner fined .
alex bentley , the executive member for traffic and transportation , said : " many people do not realise that until now , the city council has not had responsibility for removing untaxed vehicles from our streets .
" we feel sure that this new authority will allow us to act increasingly quickly in dealing with this problem .
" we plan to enforce these powers vigorously , because untaxed vehicles are a source of considerable annoyance to law-abiding residents who are willing to take responsibility for keeping their own cars within the law . "

by ian pollock bbc news personal finance reporter you have been warned .
gas and electricity prices are going to go up even further next year .
the country 's biggest gas supplier centrica said so in december - and no one doubts that the company , which trades as british gas and scottish gas , is right .
but some experts say this will turn out to be a short term problem and that prices may fall in 2007 .
wholesale prices once again centrica blamed the prospect of ever-rising bills on the need to recover the continuing climb in the wholesale cost of gas , increasing amounts of which have to be bought and imported from abroad .
wholesale costs have been rising since the autumn of 2003 .
since the start of 2004 , gas bills from british gas have now increased by 35 % , with charges for its electricity customers not far behind .
so it 's conceivable that further rounds of increases could see its customers dealing with a cumulative rise of 50 % or more in less than three years .
as recent experience has shown , the same pressures which have driven up prices from british gas will inevitably affect its energy supply rivals .
some - npower and scottish & southern - have already announced higher prices which will come into effect in january .
prices staying high the regulator , ofgem , is pessimistic about the prospects of price coming back down . "
these prices are unreasonably high and are not a reflection of a market that is working sensibly " peter lehmann , fuel poverty advisory group " we would never crystal ball gaze , " a spokesman told bbc news .
" but prices are high and likely to remain so until investment in pipelines and storage and lng come on stream in the next year or so . "
however , the regulator was keen to stress that many consumers can cut their energy bills by switching supplier .
anyone who has never switched their gas and electricity supplier can save £ 111 a year , the regulator added .
overall , inflation stayed low in 2005 , with the consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- rising by just 2.1 % in the year to november .
but within that , the cost of lighting and heating your home rocketed .
electricity bills rose by 12 % , gas bills by 17 % , and if you heat your house with an oil-fired boiler then your bills will have risen by a whopping 24 % .
how much is that actually costing you ?
if you are in an average household , then your annual gas and electricity bill will soon amount to £ 780 a year , according to the watchdog energywatch .
fuel poverty given all this , it is not surprising that more and more people are struggling to pay .
thanks to the rising cost of energy , the government 's target of eradicating by 2010 fuel poverty among the vulnerable - the elderly , households with children , or with people who are sick or disabled - has been blown way off course .
what is called " fuel poverty " is defined as someone who has to spend at least 10 % of their take-home income paying for energy .
figures published in july 2005 by the department of trade & industry suggested that the energy price increases experienced between 2003 and the end of 2005 will push an extra 400,000 households into fuel poverty by the end of 2006 .
if energy prices rise by another 10 % , then the number of english households spending more than a tenth of their incomes just to keep warm will rise by a further 400,000 to 2 million .
that would be around 10 % of the english population .
peter lehmann , chairman of the fuel poverty advisory group , called on the government to try to get prices down , especially for those on low incomes .
" these prices are unreasonably high and are not a reflection of a market that is working sensibly , " he said .
get ready for a glut the big question , therefore , is how much further domestic gas and electricity bills are likely to rise .
" we may well see one more round of increases , of the order of 5-10 % , sustained for 12 months , but not much beyond that , " says patrick heren of heren energy , which analyses the wholesale energy markets in europe .
the reason is that from 2007 onwards , current plans see the uk receiving a massive increase in its imports of gas : three new import terminals for lng -lrb- liquified natural gas -rrb- imported by tanker - two at milford haven and one at the isle of grain in kent .
a doubling of the capacity of the interconnector pipeline which transports gas from zeebrugge in belgium to bacton in norfolk , after it was doubled in size in 2005 .
a new undersea gas pipeline which will pump gas from the norwegian north sea to the yorkshire coast by the end of 2006 .
another new gas pipeline coming ashore at bacton , this time from holland .
" what that adds up to is a glut , " says mr heren .
" from 2007 to 2012 we are looking at a very different , low cost , easy supply environment . "
as a result , gas bills should fall .
and they should drag down domestic electricity bills too .
no end in sight ?
but not everyone agrees .
" even when investment has been made , prices have been generally resistant , " argues nigel cornwall of cornwall energy associates .
in addition , gas suppliers claim they have yet to pass on the full cost of higher wholesale prices .
so if those come down , they may try to recoup some of their " lost " profits .
meanwhile hard winters or even higher oil prices - which currently drive the price of gas imported from europe - could also keep domestic prices up .
an additional fact is that life is just not as simple as it was when most of our oil and gas was coming from the north sea , and supply and demand was predictable .
those north sea supplies have been dwindling more rapidly than expected .
and that means the supply of gas coming into the uk is now much more at the mercy of an international market encompassing not just europe but russia , north africa and further afield .
other countries such as italy or spain could simply outbid us for supplies of lng or even natural gas , with supplies flowing back through the interconnector to europe .
the complexities are awesome , nigel cornwall says .
which means if you 're hoping for respite from expensive energy , you 'd be well advised not to hold your breath .

by ian pollock bbc news personal finance reporter the langeled pipeline will bring gas from the north sea to yorkshire you have been warned .
gas and electricity prices are going to go up even further next year .
the country 's biggest gas supplier centrica said so in december - and no one doubts that the company , which trades as british gas and scottish gas , is right .
but some experts say this will turn out to be a short term problem and that prices may fall in 2007 .
wholesale prices once again centrica blamed the prospect of ever-rising bills on the need to recover the continuing climb in the wholesale cost of gas , increasing amounts of which have to be bought and imported from abroad .
wholesale costs have been rising since the autumn of 2003 .
since the start of 2004 , gas bills from british gas have now increased by 35 % , with charges for its electricity customers not far behind .
so it 's conceivable that further rounds of increases could see its customers dealing with a cumulative rise of 50 % or more in less than three years .
as recent experience has shown , the same pressures which have driven up prices from british gas will inevitably affect its energy supply rivals .
some - npower and scottish & southern - have already announced higher prices which will come into effect in january .
prices staying high the regulator , ofgem , is pessimistic about the prospects of price coming back down .
these prices are unreasonably high and are not a reflection of a market that is working sensibly peter lehmann , fuel poverty advisory group " we would never crystal ball gaze , " a spokesman told bbc news .
" but prices are high and likely to remain so until investment in pipelines and storage and lng come on stream in the next year or so . "
however , the regulator was keen to stress that many consumers can cut their energy bills by switching supplier .
anyone who has never switched their gas and electricity supplier can save £ 111 a year , the regulator added .
overall , inflation stayed low in 2005 , with the consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- rising by just 2.1 % in the year to november .
but within that , the cost of lighting and heating your home rocketed .
electricity bills rose by 12 % , gas bills by 17 % , and if you heat your house with an oil-fired boiler then your bills will have risen by a whopping 24 % .
how much is that actually costing you ?
if you are in an average household , then your annual gas and electricity bill will soon amount to £ 780 a year , according to the watchdog energywatch .
fuel poverty given all this , it is not surprising that more and more people are struggling to pay .
thanks to the rising cost of energy , the government 's target of eradicating by 2010 fuel poverty among the vulnerable - the elderly , households with children , or with people who are sick or disabled - has been blown way off course .
what is called " fuel poverty " is defined as someone who has to spend at least 10 % of their take-home income paying for energy .
figures published in july 2005 by the department of trade & industry suggested that the energy price increases experienced between 2003 and the end of 2005 will push an extra 400,000 households into fuel poverty by the end of 2006 .
if energy prices rise by another 10 % , then the number of english households spending more than a tenth of their incomes just to keep warm will rise by a further 400,000 to 2 million .
many more will count the cost of keeping warm this year that would be around 10 % of the english population .
peter lehmann , chairman of the fuel poverty advisory group , called on the government to try to get prices down , especially for those on low incomes .
" these prices are unreasonably high and are not a reflection of a market that is working sensibly , " he said .
get ready for a glut the big question , therefore , is how much further domestic gas and electricity bills are likely to rise .
" we may well see one more round of increases , of the order of 5-10 % , sustained for 12 months , but not much beyond that , " says patrick heren of heren energy , which analyses the wholesale energy markets in europe .
the reason is that from 2007 onwards , current plans see the uk receiving a massive increase in its imports of gas : three new import terminals for lng -lrb- liquified natural gas -rrb- imported by tanker - two at milford haven and one at the isle of grain in kent .
a doubling of the capacity of the interconnector pipeline which transports gas from zeebrugge in belgium to bacton in norfolk , after it was doubled in size in 2005 .
a new undersea gas pipeline which will pump gas from the norwegian north sea to the yorkshire coast by the end of 2006 .
another new gas pipeline coming ashore at bacton , this time from holland .
" what that adds up to is a glut , " says mr heren .
" from 2007 to 2012 we are looking at a very different , low cost , easy supply environment . "
as a result , gas bills should fall .
and they should drag down domestic electricity bills too .
no end in sight ?
but not everyone agrees .
" even when investment has been made , prices have been generally resistant , " argues nigel cornwall of cornwall energy associates .
in addition , gas suppliers claim they have yet to pass on the full cost of higher wholesale prices .
so if those come down , they may try to recoup some of their " lost " profits .
meanwhile hard winters or even higher oil prices - which currently drive the price of gas imported from europe - could also keep domestic prices up .
an additional fact is that life is just not as simple as it was when most of our oil and gas was coming from the north sea , and supply and demand was predictable .
those north sea supplies have been dwindling more rapidly than expected .
and that means the supply of gas coming into the uk is now much more at the mercy of an international market encompassing not just europe but russia , north africa and further afield .
other countries such as italy or spain could simply outbid us for supplies of lng or even natural gas , with supplies flowing back through the interconnector to europe .
the complexities are awesome , nigel cornwall says .
which means if you 're hoping for respite from expensive energy , you 'd be well advised not to hold your breath .

by ian pollock bbc news personal finance reporter the langeled pipeline will bring gas from the north sea to yorkshire you have been warned .
gas and electricity prices are going to go up even further next year .
the country 's biggest gas supplier centrica said so in december - and no one doubts that the company , which trades as british gas and scottish gas , is right .
but some experts say this will turn out to be a short term problem and that prices may fall in 2007 .
wholesale prices once again centrica blamed the prospect of ever-rising bills on the need to recover the continuing climb in the wholesale cost of gas , increasing amounts of which have to be bought and imported from abroad .
wholesale costs have been rising since the autumn of 2003 .
since the start of 2004 , gas bills from british gas have now increased by 35 % , with charges for its electricity customers not far behind .
so it 's conceivable that further rounds of increases could see its customers dealing with a cumulative rise of 50 % or more in less than three years .
as recent experience has shown , the same pressures which have driven up prices from british gas will inevitably affect its energy supply rivals .
some - npower and scottish & southern - have already announced higher prices which will come into effect in january .
prices staying high the regulator , ofgem , is pessimistic about the prospects of price coming back down .
these prices are unreasonably high and are not a reflection of a market that is working sensibly peter lehmann , fuel poverty advisory group " we would never crystal ball gaze , " a spokesman told bbc news .
" but prices are high and likely to remain so until investment in pipelines and storage and lng come on stream in the next year or so . "
however , the regulator was keen to stress that many consumers can cut their energy bills by switching supplier .
anyone who has never switched their gas and electricity supplier can save £ 111 a year , the regulator added .
overall , inflation stayed low in 2005 , with the consumer price index -lrb- cpi -rrb- rising by just 2.1 % in the year to november .
but within that , the cost of lighting and heating your home rocketed .
electricity bills rose by 12 % , gas bills by 17 % , and if you heat your house with an oil-fired boiler then your bills will have risen by a whopping 24 % .
how much is that actually costing you ?
if you are in an average household , then your annual gas and electricity bill will soon amount to £ 780 a year , according to the watchdog energywatch .
fuel poverty given all this , it is not surprising that more and more people are struggling to pay .
thanks to the rising cost of energy , the government 's target of eradicating by 2010 fuel poverty among the vulnerable - the elderly , households with children , or with people who are sick or disabled - has been blown way off course .
what is called " fuel poverty " is defined as someone who has to spend at least 10 % of their take-home income paying for energy .
figures published in july 2005 by the department of trade & industry suggested that the energy price increases experienced between 2003 and the end of 2005 will push an extra 400,000 households into fuel poverty by the end of 2006 .
if energy prices rise by another 10 % , then the number of english households spending more than a tenth of their incomes just to keep warm will rise by a further 400,000 to 2 million .
many more will count the cost of keeping warm this year that would be around 10 % of the english population .
peter lehmann , chairman of the fuel poverty advisory group , called on the government to try to get prices down , especially for those on low incomes .
" these prices are unreasonably high and are not a reflection of a market that is working sensibly , " he said .
get ready for a glut the big question , therefore , is how much further domestic gas and electricity bills are likely to rise .
" we may well see one more round of increases , of the order of 5-10 % , sustained for 12 months , but not much beyond that , " says patrick heren of heren energy , which analyses the wholesale energy markets in europe .
the reason is that from 2007 onwards , current plans see the uk receiving a massive increase in its imports of gas : three new import terminals for lng -lrb- liquified natural gas -rrb- imported by tanker - two at milford haven and one at the isle of grain in kent .
a doubling of the capacity of the interconnector pipeline which transports gas from zeebrugge in belgium to bacton in norfolk , after it was doubled in size in 2005 .
a new undersea gas pipeline which will pump gas from the norwegian north sea to the yorkshire coast by the end of 2006 .
another new gas pipeline coming ashore at bacton , this time from holland .
" what that adds up to is a glut , " says mr heren .
" from 2007 to 2012 we are looking at a very different , low cost , easy supply environment . "
as a result , gas bills should fall .
and they should drag down domestic electricity bills too .
no end in sight ?
but not everyone agrees .
" even when investment has been made , prices have been generally resistant , " argues nigel cornwall of cornwall energy associates .
in addition , gas suppliers claim they have yet to pass on the full cost of higher wholesale prices .
so if those come down , they may try to recoup some of their " lost " profits .
meanwhile hard winters or even higher oil prices - which currently drive the price of gas imported from europe - could also keep domestic prices up .
an additional fact is that life is just not as simple as it was when most of our oil and gas was coming from the north sea , and supply and demand was predictable .
those north sea supplies have been dwindling more rapidly than expected .
and that means the supply of gas coming into the uk is now much more at the mercy of an international market encompassing not just europe but russia , north africa and further afield .
other countries such as italy or spain could simply outbid us for supplies of lng or even natural gas , with supplies flowing back through the interconnector to europe .
the complexities are awesome , nigel cornwall says .
which means if you 're hoping for respite from expensive energy , you 'd be well advised not to hold your breath .

it is a landmark birthday many celebrities would prefer the world to overlook .
of this quartet , it is perhaps the most famous of them all , oscar winning berry , who has the most to dread .
halle berry will reach her 40th birthday on 14 august hollywood has a huge downer on women over 40 .
with berry seemingly still in her prime , stunningly good looking and much in demand , perhaps she will prove an exception to the rule .
but hollywood is littered with tales of aging starlets who see their careers take a nosedive after they pass the big 4-0 .
" a perfect example would be michelle pfeiffer , " says james parish , a hollywood historian and author of katharine hepburn : the untold story .
the 47-year old scarface and batman returns actress has not had a leading movie role in years .
" she does very few films - not because she 's not talented , not because she 's not pretty in a mature way , but just because there are n't many parts for women over 40 , " says mr parish .
" particularly when you 're known for playing a sex kitten it 's very hard to play that part when you 're in your 40s . "
' fresh flesh ' working girl star melanie griffith , 48 , is in the same boat .
" she deserves to work .
she is a wonderful actress and hollywood is pretty cruel with women that cross 40 , " says griffith 's husband , antonio banderas .
" sometimes here you feel hollywood just goes for fresh flesh .
i know it 's the economy and financial things but i feel bad for her because i feel they are misusing an actress who still has a lot of things to say . "
she deserves to work , she is a wonderful actress and hollywood is pretty cruel with women that cross 40 antonio banderas on melanie griffith hollywood men tend to fare better although george clooney , 44 , has decided that his days in front of the camera are numbered .
" an acting career usually has about a shelf life of ten years before people get sick of seeing you , " he explains .
" it 's a good thing to have a job to fall back on and i really do enjoy directing . "
val kilmer , 45 , has plenty of work although he recognises hollywood 's " unforgiving " approach to ageing stars .
" it 's a tough business , even if you 're talented .
i used to think it was full of hypocrisy but now i see it as a very honest town . "
' biased towards youth ' it is a town in the business of putting bums on seats .
young stars attract younger audiences and they appeal to advertisers .
" most of the movie audiences are under 30 because older people have been discouraged from going to films , " says mr parish .
" a lot of the films are n't very appetising to see .
it 's not very comfortable to go to the theatre with everyone screaming and yelling and it 's just much more convenient with home entertainment becoming so much more sophisticated to remain at home . "
hollywood has always been biased towards youth .
ever since the early 1900s , with advancing years , a-list celebrities have seen their star power wane .
michelle pfeiffer has found it harder to get roles in recent years " before the film stock that they used in cameras and lighting were very sophisticated people looked much older on screen than they were and so an actress , literally by the time she was in her mid 20s , was considered nearly a has been , " says mr parish .
" eventually it worked out that by the 1930s a woman could be a star into her mid 30s or even her mid-40s .
as we progressed past world war ii and up to the present time it got to be a pretty standard rule of thumb that once a movie actress got to be over 40 then supposedly , psychologically , america 's young kids did n't want to see her playing leading roles so they wrote fewer parts for them . "

four out of her five oscar nominations came after the age of 40 .
she was named best actress for dead man walking in 1996 .
" she still plays leading roles , she plays mature women and she 's able to find enough quirky roles and dramatic roles so that she 's not reduced to guest starring or fifth billing , " says mr parish .
katharine hepburn is also an example of an actress that bucked the trend .
