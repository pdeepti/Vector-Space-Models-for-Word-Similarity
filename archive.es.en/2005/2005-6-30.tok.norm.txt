the real madrid marksman chose to go on vacation instead of representing brazil in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did admit some of his top players were showing signs of fatigue but his team still managed to win the tournament , routing argentina 4-1 in wednesday 's final .
some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .
no team has gone on to win the world cup after confederations cup glory and if brazil falls in football 's biggest showpiece they are unlikely to regard the win here as a consolation prize . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .

with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .

but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?

if that 's a sign of things to come , the alliance could siphon off enough support to rob schröder 's center-left party of its already slim chance of victory in the next general election , which could be held as early as september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds leader gregor gysi with wasg leader oskar lafontaine at the helm of the alliance is the " odd couple " combination of two of germany 's most charismatic orators - ex-spd chairman oskar lafontaine and reform communist pds party leader gregor gysi .
their joint comeback has proved to be a draw to disgruntled socialists all over the nation . " our aim is to be the third largest party in parliament , " lafontaine said in a joint interview with gysi in stern magazine .
" a left-wing force is badly needed in parliament . " seeking support from the right ? lafontaine is , however , currently attracting criticism in the german media for making what his detractors have described as a bid for votes from the far right .
in a speech warning about job losses in germany , he used the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " when speaking of foreign workers . the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , condemned lafontaine 's use of the term .
he said he could understand that parties would try to gain support from the right ; the question was with what means , spiegel told the netzeitung . lafontaine 's word choice further fed criticism of the leftist alliance by a coalition of german writers and intellectuals . " the new leftist party is neither new nor leftist , just as the pds , despite its name , does not stand for democratic socialism , " a statement released by the coalition on wednesday read . the pds enjoys support in the former east germany , but the party has failed to take root in the west , due to widespread apprehension about the party 's communist background . " almost brilliant " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disillusionment with the spd has been building among the party 's far-left faction joining the pds to make up the leftist alliance is lafontaine 's wasg party , a break-away socialist party made up of politicians dissatisfied with schröder 's mainstream spd and its welfare and labor market reforms . " it would n't make sense if the pds and wasg each get 4.9 percent of the nationwide vote and end up outside parliament , " said lafontaine .
" that 's why we wanted to explore an alliance . " " we need a very popular man in the west , " said gysi in the interview with stern .
" and if we get along , respect each other and are n't arrogant , it 's almost brilliant .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .
the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .
asselborn , for one , is looking forward to some vacation time . " it is well known that it 's not physically easy to be simultaneously a member of a government and the eu president , " he said .
" i 'm going to have to recuperate in august . " juncker is the longest-serving european head of state , who has been playing the game of political compromise for years .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .

some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .

" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2005 curtain drops on rocky eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu president juncker has n't had an easy time of it on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .
the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .
asselborn , for one , is looking forward to some vacation time . " it is well known that it 's not physically easy to be simultaneously a member of a government and the eu president , " he said .
" i 'm going to have to recuperate in august . " juncker is the longest-serving european head of state , who has been playing the game of political compromise for years .
but just days after the shock of the failed summit , his pugnacious side came to the fore again . " the first moments of disillusionment have now passed and made me more determined than even .
our generation does n't have the right to destroy something that generations before us have built up , " he said . no time for relaxing after juncker vacates the eu president 's chair , he wo n't have time to sit back and reflect ; he will have to hit the campaign trail .
on july 10 , he must win the referendum on the eu constitution .
otherwise , he has said , he will resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses the european parliament in brussels , thursday june 23 , 2005 .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise .

" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .

but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .

their joint comeback has proved to be a draw to disgruntled socialists all over the nation . " our aim is to be the third largest party in parliament , " lafontaine said in a joint interview with gysi in stern magazine .
" a left-wing force is badly needed in parliament . " seeking support from the right ? lafontaine is , however , currently attracting criticism in the german media for making what his detractors have described as a bid for votes from the far right .
in a speech warning about job losses in germany , he used the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " when speaking of foreign workers . the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , condemned lafontaine 's use of the term .
he said he could understand that parties would try to gain support from the right ; the question was with what means , spiegel told the netzeitung . lafontaine 's word choice further fed criticism of the leftist alliance by a coalition of german writers and intellectuals . " the new leftist party is neither new nor leftist , just as the pds , despite its name , does not stand for democratic socialism , " a statement released by the coalition on wednesday read . the pds enjoys support in the former east germany , but the party has failed to take root in the west , due to widespread apprehension about the party 's communist background . " almost brilliant " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disillusionment with the spd has been building among the party 's far-left faction joining the pds to make up the leftist alliance is lafontaine 's wasg party , a break-away socialist party made up of politicians dissatisfied with schröder 's mainstream spd and its welfare and labor market reforms . " it would n't make sense if the pds and wasg each get 4.9 percent of the nationwide vote and end up outside parliament , " said lafontaine .
" that 's why we wanted to explore an alliance . " " we need a very popular man in the west , " said gysi in the interview with stern .

" we have a lot of fun playing the way we do and are always capable of scoring goals , " said the germany coach . " our emphasis is on attack and we will stick by this policy . " germany were the tournament 's top scorers netting 15 goals in their five confederations cup matches to finish third .
mexico had only conceded one goal in their three group matches but shipped in four during wednesday 's 4-3 third-place play-off defeat to germany . attacking spearhead overwhelmed mexico it was another example of germany 's bold approach with two strikers supported by three attacking midfielders .

germany won the match 3-0 . " we have scored more goals than we have conceded in this tournament , " said captain michael ballack .
" we have to stick by this policy and show our strength as an attacking unit . " defensive past eclipsed by offensive future under former manager rudi völler , defense was the backbone of success but a toothless attack saw germany crash out of euro 2004 at the first hurdle after just two goals in three matches .
klinsmann 's team bettered that tally in their opening 4-3 group win over australia . fans in leipzig then chanted the manager 's name after the win over mexico , incredibly by the same score line , showing their appreciation for the entertaining football .
" it is nice to hear the fans chanting my name , " klinsmann admitted .
" i hope they are happy with our work because we are happy with their contribution . " goals at both ends make fans jittery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand , center , watches the ball as argentina 's esteban cambiasso , unseen , scores his side 's second goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and argentina in nuremberg , southern germany , tuesday , june 21 , 2005 .
the goal glut has left fans on the edges of their seats but the defense has had the supporters covering their eyes in despair .
a tally of 15 goals scored is impressive but a concern for klinsmann is the 11 conceded - and it could have been more .
" we need to track back better as a unit but we can work on that , " he insisted . goalkeeper oliver kahn is used to keeping clean sheets at bayern munich but in his two confederations cup games he has conceded six goals .
" to concede so many goals is not normal for kahn , " said klinsmann .
" oliver was not at fault for any of the goals so maybe it is a bit frustrating for him . " " goalkeepers always like to keep clean sheets but i think kahn can see how the team is progressing . " defensive stalwarts ready to return with bayern left back philipp lahm , liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund 's christian wörns all expected to return to shore up the leaky defense , kahn may start to feel a bit more comfortable as germany prepare to do better in their next role as hosts of the 2006 world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops mexico in goalfest for third michael ballack scored a sensational free kick in extra time as ten-man germany defeated mexico 4-3 to win the confederations cup third-place playoff in leipzig on wednesday .

" we have a lot of fun playing the way we do and are always capable of scoring goals , " said the germany coach . " our emphasis is on attack and we will stick by this policy . " germany were the tournament 's top scorers netting 15 goals in their five confederations cup matches to finish third .
mexico had only conceded one goal in their three group matches but shipped in four during wednesday 's 4-3 third-place play-off defeat to germany . attacking spearhead overwhelmed mexico it was another example of germany 's bold approach with two strikers supported by three attacking midfielders .
bastian schweinsteiger , michael ballack and sebastian deisler are not renowned for their defensive skills and with full backs andreas hinkel and bernd schneider rampaging forward mexico were often outnumbered . bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , kevin kuranyi and mike hanke , from left , celebrate at the end of the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and tunisia in cologne , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
germany won the match 3-0 . " we have scored more goals than we have conceded in this tournament , " said captain michael ballack .
" we have to stick by this policy and show our strength as an attacking unit . " defensive past eclipsed by offensive future under former manager rudi völler , defense was the backbone of success but a toothless attack saw germany crash out of euro 2004 at the first hurdle after just two goals in three matches .
klinsmann 's team bettered that tally in their opening 4-3 group win over australia . fans in leipzig then chanted the manager 's name after the win over mexico , incredibly by the same score line , showing their appreciation for the entertaining football .
" it is nice to hear the fans chanting my name , " klinsmann admitted .
" i hope they are happy with our work because we are happy with their contribution . " goals at both ends make fans jittery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand , center , watches the ball as argentina 's esteban cambiasso , unseen , scores his side 's second goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and argentina in nuremberg , southern germany , tuesday , june 21 , 2005 .
the goal glut has left fans on the edges of their seats but the defense has had the supporters covering their eyes in despair .
a tally of 15 goals scored is impressive but a concern for klinsmann is the 11 conceded - and it could have been more .
" we need to track back better as a unit but we can work on that , " he insisted . goalkeeper oliver kahn is used to keeping clean sheets at bayern munich but in his two confederations cup games he has conceded six goals .
" to concede so many goals is not normal for kahn , " said klinsmann .
" oliver was not at fault for any of the goals so maybe it is a bit frustrating for him . " " goalkeepers always like to keep clean sheets but i think kahn can see how the team is progressing . " defensive stalwarts ready to return with bayern left back philipp lahm , liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund 's christian wörns all expected to return to shore up the leaky defense , kahn may start to feel a bit more comfortable as germany prepare to do better in their next role as hosts of the 2006 world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops mexico in goalfest for third michael ballack scored a sensational free kick in extra time as ten-man germany defeated mexico 4-3 to win the confederations cup third-place playoff in leipzig on wednesday .

eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.06.2005 bring on the world cup , germany says back to first page back 2/2 germany will be looking to the world cup on home soil next summer with guarded optimism .
there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .
the socceroos finished without a point and with ten goals against them in three matches but they showed spirit and goal-scoring prowess against the germans and argentineans on their way out . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .
the selecao 's domination served notice as to who was the favorite come world cup time next year .
-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- germany tops mexico in goalfest for third michael ballack scored a sensational free kick in extra time as ten-man germany defeated mexico 4-3 to win the confederations cup third-place playoff in leipzig on wednesday .
-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- german soccer officials score high germany 's world cup test run is just days old and the praise so far has been resounding : everything well-organized and punctual , no hooligan problems and some high scoring games .
now if only more tickets would sell .
-lrb- june 18 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's confed cup seen as best yet germany 's confederations cup tournament is being praised by soccer bigwigs who say it was the best yet .
however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time .

while the museum director is fighting to save it , tourism experts fear the demolition could damage berlin 's image . on july 5 excavators will move in near checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and today a popular museum . if all goes according to plan , the machines will rip out massive cement stakes out of the ground and along with it 1,065 wooden crosses that form a controversial memorial to the victims of the berlin wall . erected last year by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , the memorial , which is officially called an " artwork , " has been at the heart of an angry dispute between hildebrandt , the berlin city government and a bank that owns the land on the city 's friedrichstrasse where the memorial stands . tasteless and commercial while many have slammed the memorial as a tasteless take on the holocaust memorial which opened recently near the brandenburg gate , others have criticized the historical accuracy of the undertaking . hildebrandt has resurrected a 140-meter-strip -lrb- 153 yards -rrb- of berlin wall a few meters away from its original location , to complement the memorial . bildunterschrift : the controversial berlin wall memorial " it 's an obvious commercial trick that we do n't consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , " manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world last year . hildebrandt , who has steadfastly defended her handiwork all along has called it " a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall . " but , the bank which owns the piece of land upon which the memorial and wall stands , has decided to have the final word . after a meeting of its supervisory board on wednesday , the bag bankaktiengesellschaft said it was sticking to plans to demolish the memorial on july 5 if it was n't dismantled by then .
it then plans to sell the land . a letter to bush hildebrandt , however has decided to fight back .
on tuesday , she announced a donor campaign to collect 32 million euros -lrb- $ 38.68 million -rrb- to save her memorial from destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra hildebrandt saying that the german capital had no other place that so authentically and effectively remembered the deployment of western allies for berlin , hildebrandt added she wanted to use the money to buy the land herself and thus save the monument .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .

ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .

mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .
the real madrid marksman chose to go on vacation instead of representing brazil in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did admit some of his top players were showing signs of fatigue but his team still managed to win the tournament , routing argentina 4-1 in wednesday 's final .
some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .

it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .
the socceroos finished without a point and with ten goals against them in three matches but they showed spirit and goal-scoring prowess against the germans and argentineans on their way out . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2005 a bumpy eu ride nears end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has n't been comfortable the last six months have been tumultuous for the eu and luxembourg , which held the eu presidency .
eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .

eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

the law , which has yet to get through the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , next week , was drawn up after top companies such as car makers , bmw , daimlerchrysler and porsche refused to make public the contents of their chief executives ' pay-packets voluntarily .
the draft law was approved by both the ruling red-green coalition of social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties , as well as the opposition cdu and csu christian union parties .
the law is also expected to be approved by the majority of the bundesrat .
but the full effects are unlikely to be felt immediately , since companies will only be compelled to publish full details of their management salaries in their 2006 annual reports , which are published in spring of 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2005 a bumpy eu ride nears end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has n't been comfortable the last six months have been tumultuous for the eu and luxembourg , which held the eu presidency .
eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground .

but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

while the museum director is fighting to save it , tourism experts fear the demolition could damage berlin 's image . on july 5 excavators will move in near checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and today a popular museum . if all goes according to plan , the machines will rip out massive cement stakes out of the ground and along with it 1,065 wooden crosses that form a controversial memorial to the victims of the berlin wall . erected last year by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , the memorial , which is officially called an " artwork , " has been at the heart of an angry dispute between hildebrandt , the berlin city government and a bank that owns the land on the city 's friedrichstrasse where the memorial stands . tasteless and commercial while many have slammed the memorial as a tasteless take on the holocaust memorial which opened recently near the brandenburg gate , others have criticized the historical accuracy of the undertaking . hildebrandt has resurrected a 140-meter-strip -lrb- 153 yards -rrb- of berlin wall a few meters away from its original location , to complement the memorial . bildunterschrift : the controversial berlin wall memorial " it 's an obvious commercial trick that we do n't consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , " manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world last year . hildebrandt , who has steadfastly defended her handiwork all along has called it " a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall .

if that 's a sign of things to come , the alliance could siphon off enough support to rob schröder 's center-left party of its already slim chance of victory in the next general election , which could be held as early as september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds leader gregor gysi with wasg leader oskar lafontaine at the helm of the alliance is the " odd couple " combination of two of germany 's most charismatic orators - ex-spd chairman oskar lafontaine and reform communist pds party leader gregor gysi .
their joint comeback has proved to be a draw to disgruntled socialists all over the nation . " our aim is to be the third largest party in parliament , " lafontaine said in a joint interview with gysi in stern magazine .
" a left-wing force is badly needed in parliament . " seeking support from the right ? lafontaine is , however , currently attracting criticism in the german media for making what his detractors have described as a bid for votes from the far right .
in a speech warning about job losses in germany , he used the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " when speaking of foreign workers . the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , condemned lafontaine 's use of the term .
he said he could understand that parties would try to gain support from the right ; the question was with what means , spiegel told the netzeitung . lafontaine 's word choice further fed criticism of the leftist alliance by a coalition of german writers and intellectuals . " the new leftist party is neither new nor leftist , just as the pds , despite its name , does not stand for democratic socialism , " a statement released by the coalition on wednesday read . the pds enjoys support in the former east germany , but the party has failed to take root in the west , due to widespread apprehension about the party 's communist background . " almost brilliant " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disillusionment with the spd has been building among the party 's far-left faction joining the pds to make up the leftist alliance is lafontaine 's wasg party , a break-away socialist party made up of politicians dissatisfied with schröder 's mainstream spd and its welfare and labor market reforms . " it would n't make sense if the pds and wasg each get 4.9 percent of the nationwide vote and end up outside parliament , " said lafontaine .
" that 's why we wanted to explore an alliance . " " we need a very popular man in the west , " said gysi in the interview with stern .
" and if we get along , respect each other and are n't arrogant , it 's almost brilliant .

" we have a lot of fun playing the way we do and are always capable of scoring goals , " said the germany coach . " our emphasis is on attack and we will stick by this policy . " germany were the tournament 's top scorers netting 15 goals in their five confederations cup matches to finish third .
mexico had only conceded one goal in their three group matches but shipped in four during wednesday 's 4-3 third-place play-off defeat to germany . attacking spearhead overwhelmed mexico it was another example of germany 's bold approach with two strikers supported by three attacking midfielders .
bastian schweinsteiger , michael ballack and sebastian deisler are not renowned for their defensive skills and with full backs andreas hinkel and bernd schneider rampaging forward mexico were often outnumbered . bildunterschrift : germany 's michael ballack , bastian schweinsteiger , kevin kuranyi and mike hanke , from left , celebrate at the end of the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and tunisia in cologne , germany saturday june 18 , 2005 .
germany won the match 3-0 . " we have scored more goals than we have conceded in this tournament , " said captain michael ballack .
" we have to stick by this policy and show our strength as an attacking unit . " defensive past eclipsed by offensive future under former manager rudi völler , defense was the backbone of success but a toothless attack saw germany crash out of euro 2004 at the first hurdle after just two goals in three matches .
klinsmann 's team bettered that tally in their opening 4-3 group win over australia . fans in leipzig then chanted the manager 's name after the win over mexico , incredibly by the same score line , showing their appreciation for the entertaining football .
" it is nice to hear the fans chanting my name , " klinsmann admitted .
" i hope they are happy with our work because we are happy with their contribution . " goals at both ends make fans jittery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand , center , watches the ball as argentina 's esteban cambiasso , unseen , scores his side 's second goal during the confederations cup group a soccer match between germany and argentina in nuremberg , southern germany , tuesday , june 21 , 2005 .
the goal glut has left fans on the edges of their seats but the defense has had the supporters covering their eyes in despair .
a tally of 15 goals scored is impressive but a concern for klinsmann is the 11 conceded - and it could have been more .
" we need to track back better as a unit but we can work on that , " he insisted . goalkeeper oliver kahn is used to keeping clean sheets at bayern munich but in his two confederations cup games he has conceded six goals .
" to concede so many goals is not normal for kahn , " said klinsmann .
" oliver was not at fault for any of the goals so maybe it is a bit frustrating for him . " " goalkeepers always like to keep clean sheets but i think kahn can see how the team is progressing . " defensive stalwarts ready to return with bayern left back philipp lahm , liverpool midfielder dietmar hamann and borussia dortmund 's christian wörns all expected to return to shore up the leaky defense , kahn may start to feel a bit more comfortable as germany prepare to do better in their next role as hosts of the 2006 world cup . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany tops mexico in goalfest for third michael ballack scored a sensational free kick in extra time as ten-man germany defeated mexico 4-3 to win the confederations cup third-place playoff in leipzig on wednesday .

boris becker inspired an entire generation of german tennis players , so why does the future of the sport look so dim ? in addition to being the youngest player to ever raise the coveted wimbledon trophy , boris becker was also the first german to win the title .
that was in 1985 .
the significance of his victory was not lost on the then 17-year-old . " this is going to change tennis in germany , " he said after the match .
" i am the first wimbledon winner and now they have an idol . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi graf after her first wimbledon victory on july 2 , 1988 .
becker was n't the only idol , though .
he was soon joined by steffi graf , who was still in her teens when , in 1988 , she achieved the enviable " golden slam " - winning all four grand slam titles and the olympic gold medal in the same year . michael stich carried on the wave of german domination in tennis , winning wimbledon in 1991 . high expectations " we had a lot of success in the past with boris becker , michael stich and steffi graf , and it was all in a period of five to 10 years .
we had three wimbledon winners all at the same time , " said toralf bitzer , press officer at the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" now , they 're all retired and people expect that we should still have this level of success . " instead , german tennis is widely acknowledged to be in a state of decline .
it 's partly a victim of its own success .
as the dtb says , nothing can live up to that golden era when germany 's stars snapped up title after title and millions of little boys and girls dreamed of becoming the next boris or steffi . the best german players on the circuit today undoubtedly have a lot to live up to , but overall , their performance has been disappointing .
in may , tommy haas , nicolas kiefer and rainer schüttler all crashed out of the hamburg masters by the second round , prompting becker to publicly bemoan germany 's lack of world class players . bildunterschrift : germany 's tommy haas at the current wimbledon tournament , the german players had their worst showing in three years , with not a single german making it into the second week of competition . " something is going wrong " " it 's not satisfying , of course it is n't , " said bitzer .
" there are 1.7 million players in the dtb , we 're the third biggest sports association in germany after soccer and gymnastics , so it has to be our aim to still be in the second week of wimbledon . " according to becker , " something is going wrong " when it comes to training the next generation of german tennis stars .
" we have not found the secret to success here in germany , " he said in an interview with the newspaper bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nicolas kiefer failed to advance into the second week at wimbledon after losing to switzerland 's roger federer the dtb says that while really young players benefit from a strong training program in germany , only a handful of players make a successful transition from junior to pro . but no one , it seems - not even becker - knows how to fix the problem . " becker was involved here in training players for the davis cup , but he also did n't have a solution , " said bitzer .
" some people say it 's because no one in germany is willing to work as hard as , say , the russians , for example . " defending wimbledon champion and current darling of the tennis scene , 18-year-old maria sharapova of russia , is a case in point .
her devotion to tennis transformed the siberian girl who had nothing into a very wealthy superstar with a porsche in the garage and multi-million dollar endorsements .
her rags-to-riches story is still capable of spawning single-minded devotion to tennis in countless sharapova wannabes - and their parents .
that 's less so in germany , said bitzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's maria sharapova reacts to her wimbledon 2004 victory " girls need to start training earlier than boys , " the dtb spokesman said .
" the russian women are already playing well at age 14 , which means that at age 11 and 12 , they did nothing else but play tennis .
well , i would n't do that to my daughter . " coverage , sponsorship slipping the lack of german tennis stars has meant that the public 's love affair with the sport has also cooled .
tennis in germany no longer gets the kind of television coverage and sponsorship it did during the becker-graf era .
in a further sign of the sport 's demise , the dtb last year sold its $ 1.3 million -lrb- 1.8 euros -rrb- berlin women 's tennis association -lrb- wta -rrb- event to the gulf state of qatar for 6.7 million euros . boris becker said recently that tennis is always capable of surprises .
but while germany waits to crown its next superstar , the chances of another golden age of tennis dawning in germany are slim , says bitzer . " it wo n't happen in the next half century that we have 3 winners in 5 years - that 's not normal .
we 'll have another champion , but not three .

boris becker inspired an entire generation of german tennis players , so why does the future of the sport look so dim ? in addition to being the youngest player to ever raise the coveted wimbledon trophy , boris becker was also the first german to win the title .
that was in 1985 .
the significance of his victory was not lost on the then 17-year-old . " this is going to change tennis in germany , " he said after the match .
" i am the first wimbledon winner and now they have an idol . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi graf after her first wimbledon victory on july 2 , 1988 .
becker was n't the only idol , though .
he was soon joined by steffi graf , who was still in her teens when , in 1988 , she achieved the enviable " golden slam " - winning all four grand slam titles and the olympic gold medal in the same year . michael stich carried on the wave of german domination in tennis , winning wimbledon in 1991 . high expectations " we had a lot of success in the past with boris becker , michael stich and steffi graf , and it was all in a period of five to 10 years .
we had three wimbledon winners all at the same time , " said toralf bitzer , press officer at the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" now , they 're all retired and people expect that we should still have this level of success . " instead , german tennis is widely acknowledged to be in a state of decline .
it 's partly a victim of its own success .
as the dtb says , nothing can live up to that golden era when germany 's stars snapped up title after title and millions of little boys and girls dreamed of becoming the next boris or steffi . the best german players on the circuit today undoubtedly have a lot to live up to , but overall , their performance has been disappointing .

" something is going wrong " " it 's not satisfying , of course it is n't , " said bitzer .
" there are 1.7 million players in the dtb , we 're the third biggest sports association in germany after soccer and gymnastics , so it has to be our aim to still be in the second week of wimbledon . " according to becker , " something is going wrong " when it comes to training the next generation of german tennis stars .

boris becker inspired an entire generation of german tennis players , so why does the future of the sport look so dim ? in addition to being the youngest player to ever raise the coveted wimbledon trophy , boris becker was also the first german to win the title .
that was in 1985 .
the significance of his victory was not lost on the then 17-year-old . " this is going to change tennis in germany , " he said after the match .
" i am the first wimbledon winner and now they have an idol . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi graf after her first wimbledon victory on july 2 , 1988 .
becker was n't the only idol , though .
he was soon joined by steffi graf , who was still in her teens when , in 1988 , she achieved the enviable " golden slam " - winning all four grand slam titles and the olympic gold medal in the same year . michael stich carried on the wave of german domination in tennis , winning wimbledon in 1991 . high expectations " we had a lot of success in the past with boris becker , michael stich and steffi graf , and it was all in a period of five to 10 years .
we had three wimbledon winners all at the same time , " said toralf bitzer , press officer at the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" now , they 're all retired and people expect that we should still have this level of success . " instead , german tennis is widely acknowledged to be in a state of decline .
it 's partly a victim of its own success .
as the dtb says , nothing can live up to that golden era when germany 's stars snapped up title after title and millions of little boys and girls dreamed of becoming the next boris or steffi . the best german players on the circuit today undoubtedly have a lot to live up to , but overall , their performance has been disappointing .
in may , tommy haas , nicolas kiefer and rainer schüttler all crashed out of the hamburg masters by the second round , prompting becker to publicly bemoan germany 's lack of world class players . bildunterschrift : germany 's tommy haas at the current wimbledon tournament , the german players had their worst showing in three years , with not a single german making it into the second week of competition . " something is going wrong " " it 's not satisfying , of course it is n't , " said bitzer .
" there are 1.7 million players in the dtb , we 're the third biggest sports association in germany after soccer and gymnastics , so it has to be our aim to still be in the second week of wimbledon . " according to becker , " something is going wrong " when it comes to training the next generation of german tennis stars .
" we have not found the secret to success here in germany , " he said in an interview with the newspaper bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nicolas kiefer failed to advance into the second week at wimbledon after losing to switzerland 's roger federer the dtb says that while really young players benefit from a strong training program in germany , only a handful of players make a successful transition from junior to pro . but no one , it seems - not even becker - knows how to fix the problem . " becker was involved here in training players for the davis cup , but he also did n't have a solution , " said bitzer .
" some people say it 's because no one in germany is willing to work as hard as , say , the russians , for example . " defending wimbledon champion and current darling of the tennis scene , 18-year-old maria sharapova of russia , is a case in point .
her devotion to tennis transformed the siberian girl who had nothing into a very wealthy superstar with a porsche in the garage and multi-million dollar endorsements .
her rags-to-riches story is still capable of spawning single-minded devotion to tennis in countless sharapova wannabes - and their parents .
that 's less so in germany , said bitzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's maria sharapova reacts to her wimbledon 2004 victory " girls need to start training earlier than boys , " the dtb spokesman said .
" the russian women are already playing well at age 14 , which means that at age 11 and 12 , they did nothing else but play tennis .
well , i would n't do that to my daughter . " coverage , sponsorship slipping the lack of german tennis stars has meant that the public 's love affair with the sport has also cooled .
tennis in germany no longer gets the kind of television coverage and sponsorship it did during the becker-graf era .
in a further sign of the sport 's demise , the dtb last year sold its $ 1.3 million -lrb- 1.8 euros -rrb- berlin women 's tennis association -lrb- wta -rrb- event to the gulf state of qatar for 6.7 million euros . boris becker said recently that tennis is always capable of surprises .
but while germany waits to crown its next superstar , the chances of another golden age of tennis dawning in germany are slim , says bitzer . " it wo n't happen in the next half century that we have 3 winners in 5 years - that 's not normal .
we 'll have another champion , but not three .

they claimed that the indemnification and compensation act passed in germany on september 27 , 1994 - four years after the country 's reunification - did not offer them compensation in line with fair market property values .
but the strasbourg court declared the claims inadmissible , ruling that germany could not be held responsible for the expropriations .
" the frg -lrb- federal republic of germany -rrb- did not have any responsibility for acts committed at the instigation of the soviet occupying forces or for those perpetrated by another state against its own nationals , even though the gdr -lrb- ex-east germany -rrb- had subsequently been succeeded by the frg , " the court said .
by finding in favor of berlin in the case , the european rights court confirmed a november 2000 ruling of germany 's federal constitutional court . dw-world.de dispossessed berlin wall land owners hope for justice the former owners of real estate on which the berlin wall was built have been fighting unsuccessfully to get their property back .
a recent decision from the european court of human rights could improve their chances .

while the museum director is fighting to save it , tourism experts fear the demolition could damage berlin 's image . on july 5 excavators will move in near checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and today a popular museum . if all goes according to plan , the machines will rip out massive cement stakes out of the ground and along with it 1,065 wooden crosses that form a controversial memorial to the victims of the berlin wall . erected last year by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , the memorial , which is officially called an " artwork , " has been at the heart of an angry dispute between hildebrandt , the berlin city government and a bank that owns the land on the city 's friedrichstrasse where the memorial stands . tasteless and commercial while many have slammed the memorial as a tasteless take on the holocaust memorial which opened recently near the brandenburg gate , others have criticized the historical accuracy of the undertaking . hildebrandt has resurrected a 140-meter-strip -lrb- 153 yards -rrb- of berlin wall a few meters away from its original location , to complement the memorial . bildunterschrift : the controversial berlin wall memorial " it 's an obvious commercial trick that we do n't consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , " manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world last year . hildebrandt , who has steadfastly defended her handiwork all along has called it " a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall . " but , the bank which owns the piece of land upon which the memorial and wall stands , has decided to have the final word . after a meeting of its supervisory board on wednesday , the bag bankaktiengesellschaft said it was sticking to plans to demolish the memorial on july 5 if it was n't dismantled by then .
it then plans to sell the land . a letter to bush hildebrandt , however has decided to fight back .
on tuesday , she announced a donor campaign to collect 32 million euros -lrb- $ 38.68 million -rrb- to save her memorial from destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra hildebrandt saying that the german capital had no other place that so authentically and effectively remembered the deployment of western allies for berlin , hildebrandt added she wanted to use the money to buy the land herself and thus save the monument .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .
the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .
asselborn , for one , is looking forward to some vacation time . " it is well known that it 's not physically easy to be simultaneously a member of a government and the eu president , " he said .
" i 'm going to have to recuperate in august . " juncker is the longest-serving european head of state , who has been playing the game of political compromise for years .
but just days after the shock of the failed summit , his pugnacious side came to the fore again . " the first moments of disillusionment have now passed and made me more determined than even .
our generation does n't have the right to destroy something that generations before us have built up , " he said . no time for relaxing after juncker vacates the eu president 's chair , he wo n't have time to sit back and reflect ; he will have to hit the campaign trail .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .
the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .
asselborn , for one , is looking forward to some vacation time . " it is well known that it 's not physically easy to be simultaneously a member of a government and the eu president , " he said .
" i 'm going to have to recuperate in august . " juncker is the longest-serving european head of state , who has been playing the game of political compromise for years .
but just days after the shock of the failed summit , his pugnacious side came to the fore again . " the first moments of disillusionment have now passed and made me more determined than even .
our generation does n't have the right to destroy something that generations before us have built up , " he said . no time for relaxing after juncker vacates the eu president 's chair , he wo n't have time to sit back and reflect ; he will have to hit the campaign trail .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .
the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .
asselborn , for one , is looking forward to some vacation time . " it is well known that it 's not physically easy to be simultaneously a member of a government and the eu president , " he said .
" i 'm going to have to recuperate in august . " juncker is the longest-serving european head of state , who has been playing the game of political compromise for years .
but just days after the shock of the failed summit , his pugnacious side came to the fore again . " the first moments of disillusionment have now passed and made me more determined than even .
our generation does n't have the right to destroy something that generations before us have built up , " he said . no time for relaxing after juncker vacates the eu president 's chair , he wo n't have time to sit back and reflect ; he will have to hit the campaign trail .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2005 curtain drops on rocky eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing eu president juncker has n't had an easy time of it on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .
the socceroos finished without a point and with ten goals against them in three matches but they showed spirit and goal-scoring prowess against the germans and argentineans on their way out . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2005 berlin wall memorial faces final fury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden crosses wo n't be around for long a controversial berlin wall memorial near the famed checkpoint charlie museum is set to be razed .
while the museum director is fighting to save it , tourism experts fear the demolition could damage berlin 's image . on july 5 excavators will move in near checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and today a popular museum . if all goes according to plan , the machines will rip out massive cement stakes out of the ground and along with it 1,065 wooden crosses that form a controversial memorial to the victims of the berlin wall . erected last year by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , the memorial , which is officially called an " artwork , " has been at the heart of an angry dispute between hildebrandt , the berlin city government and a bank that owns the land on the city 's friedrichstrasse where the memorial stands . tasteless and commercial while many have slammed the memorial as a tasteless take on the holocaust memorial which opened recently near the brandenburg gate , others have criticized the historical accuracy of the undertaking . hildebrandt has resurrected a 140-meter-strip -lrb- 153 yards -rrb- of berlin wall a few meters away from its original location , to complement the memorial . bildunterschrift : the controversial berlin wall memorial " it 's an obvious commercial trick that we do n't consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , " manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world last year . hildebrandt , who has steadfastly defended her handiwork all along has called it " a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall . " but , the bank which owns the piece of land upon which the memorial and wall stands , has decided to have the final word . after a meeting of its supervisory board on wednesday , the bag bankaktiengesellschaft said it was sticking to plans to demolish the memorial on july 5 if it was n't dismantled by then .
it then plans to sell the land . a letter to bush hildebrandt , however has decided to fight back .
on tuesday , she announced a donor campaign to collect 32 million euros -lrb- $ 38.68 million -rrb- to save her memorial from destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra hildebrandt saying that the german capital had no other place that so authentically and effectively remembered the deployment of western allies for berlin , hildebrandt added she wanted to use the money to buy the land herself and thus save the monument .
at the moment the plot is leased by hildebrandt . while it may seem unlikely that the museum head will manage to collect so much in such a short period , it has n't deterred her from appealing to foundations and international companies for help .
she has also reportedly petitioned us president george w. bush . but , not everybody seems to view the wall memorial as an eyesore .
carmaker daimlerchrysler has asked the bank to at least postpone the planned evacuation of the site , while some regional politicians of the conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are said to be bravely planning to oppose the excavators on july 5 . bad for berlin 's image but , one thing the heated tussle over the wall memorial seems to have overlooked is its immense popularity among tourists to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands arrive in busloads every day at the checkpoint charlie museum : it enjoys cult status , even internationally , as berlin 's most famous cold war symbol and a documentation center for the dramatic escape attempts from former east germany to the west . most seem unbothered by the fact that the us army checkpoint in front of the museum is a mock one or that the stretch of wall along hildebrandt 's memorial stands in the wrong place as they walk around frenziedly taking photographs . berlin 's tourism boss , hans peter nerger , has caught on to the potential fall-out that a forced demolition of the memorial might entail . " when pictures of excavators mowing down the wooden crosses at the wall memorial go around the world , that 's going to be very bad for berlin , " nerger said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

-lrb- june 29 , 2005 -rrb- german soccer officials score high germany 's world cup test run is just days old and the praise so far has been resounding : everything well-organized and punctual , no hooligan problems and some high scoring games .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .
the socceroos finished without a point and with ten goals against them in three matches but they showed spirit and goal-scoring prowess against the germans and argentineans on their way out . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .

boris becker inspired an entire generation of german tennis players , so why does the future of the sport look so dim ? in addition to being the youngest player to ever raise the coveted wimbledon trophy , boris becker was also the first german to win the title .
that was in 1985 .
the significance of his victory was not lost on the then 17-year-old . " this is going to change tennis in germany , " he said after the match .
" i am the first wimbledon winner and now they have an idol . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi graf after her first wimbledon victory on july 2 , 1988 .
becker was n't the only idol , though .
he was soon joined by steffi graf , who was still in her teens when , in 1988 , she achieved the enviable " golden slam " - winning all four grand slam titles and the olympic gold medal in the same year . michael stich carried on the wave of german domination in tennis , winning wimbledon in 1991 . high expectations " we had a lot of success in the past with boris becker , michael stich and steffi graf , and it was all in a period of five to 10 years .
we had three wimbledon winners all at the same time , " said toralf bitzer , press officer at the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" now , they 're all retired and people expect that we should still have this level of success . " instead , german tennis is widely acknowledged to be in a state of decline .
it 's partly a victim of its own success .
as the dtb says , nothing can live up to that golden era when germany 's stars snapped up title after title and millions of little boys and girls dreamed of becoming the next boris or steffi . the best german players on the circuit today undoubtedly have a lot to live up to , but overall , their performance has been disappointing .
in may , tommy haas , nicolas kiefer and rainer schüttler all crashed out of the hamburg masters by the second round , prompting becker to publicly bemoan germany 's lack of world class players . bildunterschrift : germany 's tommy haas at the current wimbledon tournament , the german players had their worst showing in three years , with not a single german making it into the second week of competition . " something is going wrong " " it 's not satisfying , of course it is n't , " said bitzer .
" there are 1.7 million players in the dtb , we 're the third biggest sports association in germany after soccer and gymnastics , so it has to be our aim to still be in the second week of wimbledon . " according to becker , " something is going wrong " when it comes to training the next generation of german tennis stars .
" we have not found the secret to success here in germany , " he said in an interview with the newspaper bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nicolas kiefer failed to advance into the second week at wimbledon after losing to switzerland 's roger federer the dtb says that while really young players benefit from a strong training program in germany , only a handful of players make a successful transition from junior to pro . but no one , it seems - not even becker - knows how to fix the problem . " becker was involved here in training players for the davis cup , but he also did n't have a solution , " said bitzer .
" some people say it 's because no one in germany is willing to work as hard as , say , the russians , for example . " defending wimbledon champion and current darling of the tennis scene , 18-year-old maria sharapova of russia , is a case in point .
her devotion to tennis transformed the siberian girl who had nothing into a very wealthy superstar with a porsche in the garage and multi-million dollar endorsements .
her rags-to-riches story is still capable of spawning single-minded devotion to tennis in countless sharapova wannabes - and their parents .
that 's less so in germany , said bitzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's maria sharapova reacts to her wimbledon 2004 victory " girls need to start training earlier than boys , " the dtb spokesman said .
" the russian women are already playing well at age 14 , which means that at age 11 and 12 , they did nothing else but play tennis .
well , i would n't do that to my daughter . " coverage , sponsorship slipping the lack of german tennis stars has meant that the public 's love affair with the sport has also cooled .
tennis in germany no longer gets the kind of television coverage and sponsorship it did during the becker-graf era .
in a further sign of the sport 's demise , the dtb last year sold its $ 1.3 million -lrb- 1.8 euros -rrb- berlin women 's tennis association -lrb- wta -rrb- event to the gulf state of qatar for 6.7 million euros . boris becker said recently that tennis is always capable of surprises .
but while germany waits to crown its next superstar , the chances of another golden age of tennis dawning in germany are slim , says bitzer . " it wo n't happen in the next half century that we have 3 winners in 5 years - that 's not normal .
we 'll have another champion , but not three .

boris becker inspired an entire generation of german tennis players , so why does the future of the sport look so dim ? in addition to being the youngest player to ever raise the coveted wimbledon trophy , boris becker was also the first german to win the title .
that was in 1985 .
the significance of his victory was not lost on the then 17-year-old . " this is going to change tennis in germany , " he said after the match .
" i am the first wimbledon winner and now they have an idol . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steffi graf after her first wimbledon victory on july 2 , 1988 .
becker was n't the only idol , though .
he was soon joined by steffi graf , who was still in her teens when , in 1988 , she achieved the enviable " golden slam " - winning all four grand slam titles and the olympic gold medal in the same year . michael stich carried on the wave of german domination in tennis , winning wimbledon in 1991 . high expectations " we had a lot of success in the past with boris becker , michael stich and steffi graf , and it was all in a period of five to 10 years .
we had three wimbledon winners all at the same time , " said toralf bitzer , press officer at the german tennis federation -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" now , they 're all retired and people expect that we should still have this level of success . " instead , german tennis is widely acknowledged to be in a state of decline .
it 's partly a victim of its own success .
as the dtb says , nothing can live up to that golden era when germany 's stars snapped up title after title and millions of little boys and girls dreamed of becoming the next boris or steffi . the best german players on the circuit today undoubtedly have a lot to live up to , but overall , their performance has been disappointing .
in may , tommy haas , nicolas kiefer and rainer schüttler all crashed out of the hamburg masters by the second round , prompting becker to publicly bemoan germany 's lack of world class players . bildunterschrift : germany 's tommy haas at the current wimbledon tournament , the german players had their worst showing in three years , with not a single german making it into the second week of competition . " something is going wrong " " it 's not satisfying , of course it is n't , " said bitzer .
" there are 1.7 million players in the dtb , we 're the third biggest sports association in germany after soccer and gymnastics , so it has to be our aim to still be in the second week of wimbledon . " according to becker , " something is going wrong " when it comes to training the next generation of german tennis stars .
" we have not found the secret to success here in germany , " he said in an interview with the newspaper bild . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nicolas kiefer failed to advance into the second week at wimbledon after losing to switzerland 's roger federer the dtb says that while really young players benefit from a strong training program in germany , only a handful of players make a successful transition from junior to pro . but no one , it seems - not even becker - knows how to fix the problem . " becker was involved here in training players for the davis cup , but he also did n't have a solution , " said bitzer .
" some people say it 's because no one in germany is willing to work as hard as , say , the russians , for example . " defending wimbledon champion and current darling of the tennis scene , 18-year-old maria sharapova of russia , is a case in point .
her devotion to tennis transformed the siberian girl who had nothing into a very wealthy superstar with a porsche in the garage and multi-million dollar endorsements .
her rags-to-riches story is still capable of spawning single-minded devotion to tennis in countless sharapova wannabes - and their parents .
that 's less so in germany , said bitzer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's maria sharapova reacts to her wimbledon 2004 victory " girls need to start training earlier than boys , " the dtb spokesman said .
" the russian women are already playing well at age 14 , which means that at age 11 and 12 , they did nothing else but play tennis .
well , i would n't do that to my daughter . " coverage , sponsorship slipping the lack of german tennis stars has meant that the public 's love affair with the sport has also cooled .
tennis in germany no longer gets the kind of television coverage and sponsorship it did during the becker-graf era .
in a further sign of the sport 's demise , the dtb last year sold its $ 1.3 million -lrb- 1.8 euros -rrb- berlin women 's tennis association -lrb- wta -rrb- event to the gulf state of qatar for 6.7 million euros . boris becker said recently that tennis is always capable of surprises .
but while germany waits to crown its next superstar , the chances of another golden age of tennis dawning in germany are slim , says bitzer . " it wo n't happen in the next half century that we have 3 winners in 5 years - that 's not normal .
we 'll have another champion , but not three .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .
the real madrid marksman chose to go on vacation instead of representing brazil in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did admit some of his top players were showing signs of fatigue but his team still managed to win the tournament , routing argentina 4-1 in wednesday 's final .
some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .
no team has gone on to win the world cup after confederations cup glory and if brazil falls in football 's biggest showpiece they are unlikely to regard the win here as a consolation prize . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable .

britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .

but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .

how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .

eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable .

harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .

i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .

if that 's a sign of things to come , the alliance could siphon off enough support to rob schröder 's center-left party of its already slim chance of victory in the next general election , which could be held as early as september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds leader gregor gysi with wasg leader oskar lafontaine at the helm of the alliance is the " odd couple " combination of two of germany 's most charismatic orators - ex-spd chairman oskar lafontaine and reform communist pds party leader gregor gysi .
their joint comeback has proved to be a draw to disgruntled socialists all over the nation . " our aim is to be the third largest party in parliament , " lafontaine said in a joint interview with gysi in stern magazine .
" a left-wing force is badly needed in parliament . " seeking support from the right ? lafontaine is , however , currently attracting criticism in the german media for making what his detractors have described as a bid for votes from the far right .
in a speech warning about job losses in germany , he used the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " when speaking of foreign workers . the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , condemned lafontaine 's use of the term .
he said he could understand that parties would try to gain support from the right ; the question was with what means , spiegel told the netzeitung . lafontaine 's word choice further fed criticism of the leftist alliance by a coalition of german writers and intellectuals . " the new leftist party is neither new nor leftist , just as the pds , despite its name , does not stand for democratic socialism , " a statement released by the coalition on wednesday read . the pds enjoys support in the former east germany , but the party has failed to take root in the west , due to widespread apprehension about the party 's communist background . " almost brilliant " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disillusionment with the spd has been building among the party 's far-left faction joining the pds to make up the leftist alliance is lafontaine 's wasg party , a break-away socialist party made up of politicians dissatisfied with schröder 's mainstream spd and its welfare and labor market reforms . " it would n't make sense if the pds and wasg each get 4.9 percent of the nationwide vote and end up outside parliament , " said lafontaine .
" that 's why we wanted to explore an alliance . " " we need a very popular man in the west , " said gysi in the interview with stern .
" and if we get along , respect each other and are n't arrogant , it 's almost brilliant .

for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.06.2005 berlin wall memorial faces final fury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wooden crosses wo n't be around for long a controversial berlin wall memorial near the famed checkpoint charlie museum is set to be razed .
while the museum director is fighting to save it , tourism experts fear the demolition could damage berlin 's image . on july 5 excavators will move in near checkpoint charlie , the former border crossing between the american and soviet sector and today a popular museum . if all goes according to plan , the machines will rip out massive cement stakes out of the ground and along with it 1,065 wooden crosses that form a controversial memorial to the victims of the berlin wall . erected last year by alexandra hildebrandt , the ukrainian-born head of the checkpoint charlie museum , the memorial , which is officially called an " artwork , " has been at the heart of an angry dispute between hildebrandt , the berlin city government and a bank that owns the land on the city 's friedrichstrasse where the memorial stands . tasteless and commercial while many have slammed the memorial as a tasteless take on the holocaust memorial which opened recently near the brandenburg gate , others have criticized the historical accuracy of the undertaking . hildebrandt has resurrected a 140-meter-strip -lrb- 153 yards -rrb- of berlin wall a few meters away from its original location , to complement the memorial . bildunterschrift : the controversial berlin wall memorial " it 's an obvious commercial trick that we do n't consider appropriately remembering the victims of the wall , " manuela damianakis , a spokeswoman for the city planning department told dw-world last year . hildebrandt , who has steadfastly defended her handiwork all along has called it " a monument to peace and the victims of the berlin wall . " but , the bank which owns the piece of land upon which the memorial and wall stands , has decided to have the final word . after a meeting of its supervisory board on wednesday , the bag bankaktiengesellschaft said it was sticking to plans to demolish the memorial on july 5 if it was n't dismantled by then .
it then plans to sell the land . a letter to bush hildebrandt , however has decided to fight back .
on tuesday , she announced a donor campaign to collect 32 million euros -lrb- $ 38.68 million -rrb- to save her memorial from destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexandra hildebrandt saying that the german capital had no other place that so authentically and effectively remembered the deployment of western allies for berlin , hildebrandt added she wanted to use the money to buy the land herself and thus save the monument .
at the moment the plot is leased by hildebrandt . while it may seem unlikely that the museum head will manage to collect so much in such a short period , it has n't deterred her from appealing to foundations and international companies for help .
she has also reportedly petitioned us president george w. bush . but , not everybody seems to view the wall memorial as an eyesore .
carmaker daimlerchrysler has asked the bank to at least postpone the planned evacuation of the site , while some regional politicians of the conservative opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- are said to be bravely planning to oppose the excavators on july 5 . bad for berlin 's image but , one thing the heated tussle over the wall memorial seems to have overlooked is its immense popularity among tourists to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands arrive in busloads every day at the checkpoint charlie museum : it enjoys cult status , even internationally , as berlin 's most famous cold war symbol and a documentation center for the dramatic escape attempts from former east germany to the west . most seem unbothered by the fact that the us army checkpoint in front of the museum is a mock one or that the stretch of wall along hildebrandt 's memorial stands in the wrong place as they walk around frenziedly taking photographs . berlin 's tourism boss , hans peter nerger , has caught on to the potential fall-out that a forced demolition of the memorial might entail . " when pictures of excavators mowing down the wooden crosses at the wall memorial go around the world , that 's going to be very bad for berlin , " nerger said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trivializing the wall as germany celebrates tourism day on wednesday , a row has erupted over controversial plans to rebuild a part of the berlin wall near one of the country ’ s most famous tourist attractions , checkpoint charlie .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .
the real madrid marksman chose to go on vacation instead of representing brazil in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did admit some of his top players were showing signs of fatigue but his team still managed to win the tournament , routing argentina 4-1 in wednesday 's final .
some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .
no team has gone on to win the world cup after confederations cup glory and if brazil falls in football 's biggest showpiece they are unlikely to regard the win here as a consolation prize . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .

the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.06.2005 a bumpy eu ride nears end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it has n't been comfortable the last six months have been tumultuous for the eu and luxembourg , which held the eu presidency .
eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .
the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground .
-lrb- june 30 , 2005 -rrb- eu sticks by plans for turkey talks the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership .

after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .

the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .
the exertion could be seen on the faces of juncker and foreign minister jean asselborn .
asselborn , for one , is looking forward to some vacation time . " it is well known that it 's not physically easy to be simultaneously a member of a government and the eu president , " he said .
" i 'm going to have to recuperate in august . " juncker is the longest-serving european head of state , who has been playing the game of political compromise for years .
but just days after the shock of the failed summit , his pugnacious side came to the fore again . " the first moments of disillusionment have now passed and made me more determined than even .
our generation does n't have the right to destroy something that generations before us have built up , " he said . no time for relaxing after juncker vacates the eu president 's chair , he wo n't have time to sit back and reflect ; he will have to hit the campaign trail .
on july 10 , he must win the referendum on the eu constitution .
otherwise , he has said , he will resign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair addresses the european parliament in brussels , thursday june 23 , 2005 .
on july 1 , british prime minister tony blair takes possession of the european scepter .
but the luxembourgers are not counting on their successors and new favorite enemy to make much progress with the big questions : constitutional ratification , eu basic principles and the tricky issue of financing . for the head of the socialists in the european parliament , martin schulz , the conservative juncker is sure to get a place in the history books . " maybe it 's too early to say today , but i 'm sure that after us there will be people who say that jean-claude juncker belongs in the gallery with the truly great europeans , " he said . bernd riegert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair under fire as eu presidency looms days before britain takes over the eu presidency , german chancellor schröder has lashed out at the uk 's version of europe and prime minister tony blair 's entrenched stance on his country 's eu rebate .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .
a second responsibility is the negotiation with turkey . micha el knigge interviewed jean asselborn -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain drops on rocky eu presidency on june 30 , luxembourg 's turn as eu president comes to an end .

if that 's a sign of things to come , the alliance could siphon off enough support to rob schröder 's center-left party of its already slim chance of victory in the next general election , which could be held as early as september . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pds leader gregor gysi with wasg leader oskar lafontaine at the helm of the alliance is the " odd couple " combination of two of germany 's most charismatic orators - ex-spd chairman oskar lafontaine and reform communist pds party leader gregor gysi .
their joint comeback has proved to be a draw to disgruntled socialists all over the nation . " our aim is to be the third largest party in parliament , " lafontaine said in a joint interview with gysi in stern magazine .
" a left-wing force is badly needed in parliament . " seeking support from the right ? lafontaine is , however , currently attracting criticism in the german media for making what his detractors have described as a bid for votes from the far right .
in a speech warning about job losses in germany , he used the nazi-tainted term " fremdarbeiter " when speaking of foreign workers . the president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , condemned lafontaine 's use of the term .
he said he could understand that parties would try to gain support from the right ; the question was with what means , spiegel told the netzeitung . lafontaine 's word choice further fed criticism of the leftist alliance by a coalition of german writers and intellectuals . " the new leftist party is neither new nor leftist , just as the pds , despite its name , does not stand for democratic socialism , " a statement released by the coalition on wednesday read . the pds enjoys support in the former east germany , but the party has failed to take root in the west , due to widespread apprehension about the party 's communist background . " almost brilliant " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disillusionment with the spd has been building among the party 's far-left faction joining the pds to make up the leftist alliance is lafontaine 's wasg party , a break-away socialist party made up of politicians dissatisfied with schröder 's mainstream spd and its welfare and labor market reforms . " it would n't make sense if the pds and wasg each get 4.9 percent of the nationwide vote and end up outside parliament , " said lafontaine .
" that 's why we wanted to explore an alliance . " " we need a very popular man in the west , " said gysi in the interview with stern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.06.2005 germany 's confed cup seen as best yet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the confed cup won praise but no-show ronaldo calls for it to end germany 's confederations cup tournament is being praised by soccer bigwigs who say it was the best yet .
however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .
the real madrid marksman chose to go on vacation instead of representing brazil in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did admit some of his top players were showing signs of fatigue but his team still managed to win the tournament , routing argentina 4-1 in wednesday 's final .
some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .
no team has gone on to win the world cup after confederations cup glory and if brazil falls in football 's biggest showpiece they are unlikely to regard the win here as a consolation prize . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .

there were huge positives gained from the campaign that saw the host nation take the third spot but there will be just as large question marks over certain aspects which led them to a play-off final rather than the final proper itself . jürgen klinsmann should be applauded for using the confederations cup to really blood his young stars and the impact on the tournament of attacking players like lukas podolski , bastian schweinsteiger and mike hanke and his youthful back line should bode well for a successful future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the offensive displays put germany ahead in the scoring stakes , defensive fallibilities almost ended the adventure before it began .
in an expanded tournament against more world class teams , germany may be found wanting . mexico were just one of the teams that exposed the german defense .
ricardo lavolpe 's team were supposed to be a surprise but coming into the tournament on the back on an 18 game unbeaten streak , it was hard to see why .
when they increased that to 21 with wins over japan and brazil and a draw with greece , it looked less like a surprise package but a team coming into a golden period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico 's rafael marquez , 2nd left , is shown the red card by referee roberto rosetti of italy after his second bookable offence following a foul on argentina 's pablo aimar , bottom right , during the confederations cup semi final soccer match between argentina and mexico in hanover , germany sunday june 26 , 2005 .
the long and painful semi-final defeat to argentina knocked the stuffing out of them but they still managed to fight back three times against the germans before succumbing to michael ballack 's superbly executed free-kick in extra-time .
mexico showed they could play but need to take it to another level if they are to be considered dark horses for the world cup next year . elsewhere , japan showed that their so-called " future " brand of soccer was coming of age with impressive performances against greece and brazil but also showed that , if they are to progress from being the most consistent and imaginative asian team , they have to learn how to put chances away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece could have been buried under a goal avalanche if japan had scored half the chances they missed against them and it would have been no less than the woeful greeks deserved .
something radical needs to be done in greece to get the european champions fired up again before the world cup . african champions tunisia made a lot of friends in germany but failed to really get to grips with the stage they were on .
despite holding germany for 74 minutes , giving argentina a scare and beating the socceroos , tunisia looked exactly what they are : a team in evolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia also made friends and also some enemies with their combative style .
the socceroos finished without a point and with ten goals against them in three matches but they showed spirit and goal-scoring prowess against the germans and argentineans on their way out . nick amies , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .

eu council president jean asselborn told dw-world about the tough tenure and why the balkans is more crucial than turkey . dw-world : luxembourg led the eu presidency for the last six months .
it was a turbulent half year involving several setbacks for europe : the eu constitution has been indefinitely put on ice , agreement on the bloc 's finances has failed , and the eu is in the grip of crisis .
are you personally bitter in the face of all this ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn jean asselborn : it really was a difficult presidency .
with some hard work we could solve problems regarding the stability and growth pact .
that was a success .
but you 're right about the collapse of the eu 's budget talks .
24 countries pushed for a solution to the british rebate , but it did n't work .
i think the british presidency understands - after all the british are very intelligent politicians - that you ca n't afford a pause after such a failure .
we have to work hard again .
our suggestion 's on the table and i 'm convinced that it will help the british to steer the eu motor back on the right path again .
we 'll make it very tough for the new member states if we do n't manage to solve the eu 's budgetary problems .
the british know that , that 's why i 'm curious about how far removed their suggestion to end the crisis would be from ours in the end . naturally , one is always wiser in hindsight , but if you were to repeat the last six months with what you know today , what would you do differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france said an overwhelming " no " to the constitution what can a presidency do against decisions of the dutch and french electorate ?
we had a program - we managed to implement some of it and some we did n't .
we knew that our presidency - in the face of the referendum and other topics which we were given when we took over - would not be easy .
but we 've done some good spadework for the next presidency .
if we want europe to continue to play an important role in the world and be more than just a free trade zone , then we must work on deepening the bloc . now you 're handing over the eu presidency reins to tony blair , of all people , who has described the luxembourg budgetary compromise solution as " unacceptable . "
harsh words have been exchanged .
is that the final straw between you and the british ?
will there be a formal handover of office between you and british foreign minister straw and premiers juncker and blair ? we 're all grown-ups .
britain 's strategy over the budget negotiations was strange .
they knew very well that it would be quite difficult to dismantle the common agricultural policy and restructure it .
that was shoved to the center of negotiations in order to distract attention from the british rebate .
24 countries wanted a change to the rebate but because the british blocked it , we did n't manage to push it through .
now the british have to find a solution in the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair speaks to meps at the european parliament in brussels there are absolutely no personal problems between straw and i , nor do i think between tony blair and jean-claude juncker .
we 'll look each other in the eye again and continue to battle - each in his own way - to bring europe forward .
i 'm convinced that the british wo n't completely reject our recommendations on the budget .
but we must also do a rethink together with the british , to give the eu more depth .
and we need the constitution so that the eu functions better .
i do n't know whether the present draft constitution will ever become reality .
but we must explain to the people of europe why we want a deepening of the eu and for more profoundness we need a constitution . let 's attempt a look at the future .
how will the eu look in 10 years ?
will it be the same eu as today or will it be a different form of alliance ? the eu still has to tackle a geographical responsibility , namely to give the people in the balkans a european perspective .
if europe does n't manage this really important duty , then it 's missed its goal .
we have to give the people between slovenia and greece a chance to integrate themselves in europe .
europe must , in the coming decade , concentrate on this geographical border . you did n't explicitly mention turkey .
will turkey be a member of the eu in 10 years ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish men drink tea at a bazaar in istanbul turkey has received a date from the european union .
the negotiations over membership will begin on oct .
3 .
that 's an open-ended process , rightly articulated as much by the eu commission .
this perspective has brought many positive things for the people in turkey .
the death sentence has been scrapped , torture - at least on paper - does n't exist any more , and there have been reforms in the field of human rights .
but , many more things still have to become concrete in turkey , though there 's already a very good start .
one problem that still has to be resolved , even by the eu , is the cyprus issue .
all this will take years and one day we 'll have to decide whether we can link the bridge between west and east and turkey .
but , as the biggest responsibility , we need to concentrate on the balkans .
if we do n't do that , there 's a danger of new conflicts in the region .

however , some stars are unhappy about having to play and some officials see it as a waste of time . the brilliance of brazil , the artistry of argentina and the guile of germany were all on show at the 2005 confederations cup but was the tournament a success or a superfluous fixture pile-up ? from a sporting aspect the competition offered a lot , with 37 goals scored in the 12 group games and average crowds of 36,000 packing the venues . fantastic goals , such as the left-footed missile from brazil 's adriano against greece , or riquelme 's exquisite free-kick for argentina against germany , helped to attract in excess of 10 million viewers per match in germany alone . aside from the host nation , the seven other participants - argentina , greece , mexico , japan , brazil , tunisia and australia - ensured a global audience and the tournament was broadcast to 170 countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily , left , and german soccer legend and head of the organizing committee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer .
" the confederations cup is becoming increasingly popular and has its own image and character , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the organizing committee for the 2006 world cup . for german organizers the competition was a significant test for the main event in 12 months ' time but some questioned the wisdom of more fixtures after grueling domestic seasons . no-show ronaldo prefers the beach " tournaments like the confederations cup should be abolished because the players are just too tired , " said brazil superstar ronaldo .
the real madrid marksman chose to go on vacation instead of representing brazil in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira brazil coach carlos alberto parreira did admit some of his top players were showing signs of fatigue but his team still managed to win the tournament , routing argentina 4-1 in wednesday 's final .
some players were believed to have played out of fear of losing their spot for next year 's world cup but the passion was there for all to see . passion on and off the pitch marked improvement the disappointment of the losing semi-finalists germany and mexico was only bettered by argentina , which was crushed by its south american foe brazil in the frankfurt final . the next confederations cup host , south africa , has a lot to live up to in 2009 as it prepares for the world cup a year later . national anthems sung with pride and colorful fans helped give the confederations cup some atmosphere and in that respect it was a huge improvement on the last competition in france two years ago . bildunterschrift : " the fifa confederations cup is now a universally accepted and appreciated event , " said fifa president sepp blatter .
" this competition is no longer simply a road test . " trial run a chance to iron out creases but germany saw it as a chance to win over their demanding public and the world cup organizers admitted they were more interested in fixing things before next year 's tournament . the five stadiums used in frankfurt , nuremberg , cologne , leipzig and hanover all proved themselves worthy world cup venues while training facilities , local transport and friendly volunteers were positives from this dress rehearsal . the emergence of pitch invaders was the main setback for organizers with the sight of four stewards trying to catch an uninvited man in germany 's semi-final with brazil leaving the hosts a touch embarrassed . this confederations cup has served as a nice appetizer for the main event in 12 months but its significance should not be over hyped .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .
the electrifying confidence of the 3-1 world cup qualifying victory over brazil in may was sadly missing throughout this tournament . read more about the confederations cup . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .
now that a " pause for reflection " has been put into effect , the constitution is frozen until 2008 . a bit of success the only real success that juncker can claim , and it 's a qualified one at that , is the relaxation of the deficit rules , decided in march , for countries who fall foul of the rules of the stability and growth pact , such as germany and france .
critics say all the reform did was weaken rules meant to ensure the strength of the euro .
but juncker calls it a win . " we have reformed the stability and growth pact and brought a long period of uncertainty to an end , " said juncker . the luxembourgers also tried to revive the so-called lisbon agenda , which aims to spark higher rates of economic growth and development in the eu . the grand-duchy also came in for praise , even from the british , for its highly organized running of the presidency .
the tiny state had to make due with fewer staff members than other countries in organizing and heading dozens of meetings in its six months at the eu helm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn , left , gestures while speaking with british foreign secretary jack straw , center , and eu foreign policy chief javier solana during a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg , monday june 13 , 2005 .

the grand-duchy 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , had ambitious plans during his tenure as eu head , but had to watch as several of them ran aground . for luxembourg 's prime minister , the absolute nadir of his stint as eu president came in the early hours of june 18 at the close of an eu summit .
after 60 hours of negotiations , he was forced to announce that no compromise had been reached in the contentious disagreement over the eu budget . " europe is n't only experiencing a crisis , it 's going through a really profound crisis , " he said . the negotiations , which centered on eu financing , stalled primarily around british prime minister tony blair , who demanded a fundamental change in the course of the european bloc .
in a dig at blair , a then-bitter juncker told the man who was to follow him as eu president that he could not give him any parting advice , since blair would n't take any advice anyway . despite juncker 's failure to find common ground among several eu member states , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised the luxembourger for trying his best to find a compromise . " a truly great presidency , a truly great european , jean-claude juncker tried everything to bring the parties to an agreement , " schröder said . accusations that juncker overloaded the eu summit , which actually only succeeded in postponing any solution to the constitutional financing crises , have been angrily repudiated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker " i am interested in working for europe and the interests of its citizens , " he said .
" i do n't have time to play games . " after the french and dutch rejected the referendums on the eu constitution , the luxembourg presidency tried to insist that ratification should continue .
but the position was quickly seen as unrealistic .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .
the way carlos alberto parreira 's team dismantled their old foes was a throwback to the days of pele , socrates and zico . entering the competition with question marks over their heads , the new brazil can surely look to the world cup next year and have high hopes of retaining the trophy . argentina , however , will feel that they never got into their highest gear despite two wins and a draw in their group stage .
while the 4-1 final score line in the final was anything but flattering , the argentineans will know that it was not a true reflection on how they can really play .
the likes of hernan crespo , roberto ayala and the suspended javier saviola will surely feature at the world cup if fit and one would expect a more confident display . bildunterschrift : saying that , it was not a b-list side that jose pekerman put out at the confederations cup and when it came to the crunch players like juan pablo sorin and juan riquelme went missing at times .

from organization to execution , the event can rightly be considered a success .
it bodes well for germany 's world cup next year . the 2005 confederations cup can be considered a success for the majority of those involved .
for those who organized and conducted it , a few pitch invaders and leaky roofs aside , the tournament ran smoothly with few visible hitches . the german world cup organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- should be looking to the main event next summer with optimism after presiding over a festival of soccer which brought in impressive crowds for the big games and delivered , on the whole , exciting matches played in the right spirit . as a result , those fans that did travel can also be regarded as winners .
the german transport system coped well with the cowrds that flocked to the confederations cup and made sure that most people go to and back to where they wanted to be safely .
the stadiums , apart from the leaky roof in frankfurt on wednesday night , were in tip-top shape and provided safe and comfortable venues in which the average gates of 36,000 fans could enjoy the soccer . there were problems with slight lapses in security which allowed four interlopers to get onto the field in four separate matches , something which will have to be addressed before nations with more dubious fans arrive for the world cup , and some of the games looked to be poorly attended .
but on the whole , the supporters were catered for in a way you would expect from the efficient and organized germans . on the pitch , the confederations cup surpassed its rather insulting title of " mini world cup " and provided a feast of goals , nail-biting matches , shocks and surprises as befitting a major international tournament . a return to the heady days of brazil greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's striker adriano socers the fourth goal for brazil in wednesday 's confed cup final .
brazil showed that hype and weight of history can be carried effortlessly on even the youngest shoulders as the new breed of samba stars rolled back the years and finally put on a performance worthy of the canary yellow shirt by thrashing argentina 4-1 to win the cup . they had stuttered against mexico , almost imploded against japan and labored against germany but on wednesday night they showed what it means to be brazil .

the move seemed designed to shore up president gloria arroyo 's government , already undermined by allegations of vote rigging and influence-peddling .
on monday , mrs arroyo admitted talking to an election official during the vote-count of last year 's election .
she also said her husband , whom critics accuse of taking pay-offs from illegal gambling groups , would move abroad .
mr yap is one of several cabinet members seen as close to mrs arroyo .
" i have become convinced that i should clear my name - not as a member of the president 's cabinet but as a citizen of the republic , " mr yap told a news conference on thursday .
but he insisted he was not guilty of tax evasion , nor was he resigning in response to the mounting pressure being heaped on the president .
' lapse of judgement ' mrs arroyo , who has made the fight against corruption a key pledge of her presidency , is trying to win back public trust after a series of potentially damaging incidents .
arroyo 's problems accused of using position to influence 2004 poll husband accused of influence-peddling and taking bribes son and brother-in-law also implicated family denies all allegations toughest week on monday she admitted to having called an election official during the may 2004 vote count , which while not illegal , is likely to be viewed by many filipinos as unethical conduct .
mrs arroyo apologised to the nation for what she called a " lapse of judgement " but denied trying to influence the outcome of the poll - in which she beat the now-deceased film star fernando poe by more than a million votes .
her admission came after the opposition released an audio tape in which a woman who sounded like the president could be heard speaking with a senior election commissioner .
the president 's husband , jose miguel arroyo , widely known as mike , has also been accused of scandal , along with their son and mrs arroyo 's brother-in-law .
opposition lawmakers have accused them of taking bribes from illegal gambling syndicates - charges they deny .
on wednesday mrs arroyo announced that her husband would move abroad indefinitely , in a move analysts say is an attempt to silence the president 's critics .
impeachment calls in response to the scandals , opposition groups are increasingly calling for mrs arroyo 's impeachment .
but analysts say they are unlikely to succeed as she enjoys majority support in both chambers of congress .
there is growing speculation that mrs arroyo may soon order a major cabinet reshuffle .
but presidential spokesman ignacio bunye told the french news agency afp on thursday : " the rumours are exaggerated . "
manila 's already beleaguered economy has been affected by the crisis , and the peso hit a five-month low early on thursday , sinking to 56.19 to the dollar .

derriford hospital 's vanguard project in plymouth ran into trouble after two out of the three contractors bidding to carry out the work pulled out .
negotiations with the last of the three bidders for the 17-operating theatre , 400-bed centre have also ceased .
a new plan will go for approval in july and put out tender in by the autumn .

as a result of this , local health chiefs contacted the last remaining bidder this week to formally cease negotiations with it .
project director andy ibbs said : " it would have been far from ideal to be negotiating with just one bidder in a major project such as this .
" it would have presented us with problems such as a lack of visible competition and made it very difficult to ensure that what we deliver is the best value for money .
" when dealing with public money , it is extremely important that the process for such a major project is as competitive as it can be . "

it may also be scaled down slightly from the 17 theatres and 400-beds originally planned .
the revised plan will also look to provide more healthcare closer to people 's homes .
it will be built under the pfi and owned privately , then effectively leased back to the national health service .
health trusts involved in the project include plymouth primary care trust , south hams and west devon primary care trust , north and east cornwall primary care trust , the south west peninsula strategic health authority and plymouth hospitals nhs trust .

games consultant ernest adams will say the stage is set for an explosion of women gamers , especially in the area of massively-multi-player online gaming .
there needs to be a sea-change in the industry , with more female developers and more games for women , he believes .
mr adams is to address the 2005 women in games conference being held in august in dundee , scotland .
puzzling games the games that are likely to appeal to women are not the traditional " hack and slash " ones or time-consuming strategy games that men prefer .
" women do n't have free time even to set up a game .
they require a game that is quick to get into and does n't require a great time commitment , " said mr adams , founder of the international game developers ' association .
the fact that women also tend to be more social means multi-player games will appeal more than single-player ones .
" we are soon going to be seeing massively-multi-player online games that are dominated by female players , " he said .
" existing online role-playing games are succeeding with women in spite of their subject matter , not because of it .

" there will be new elections in germany .
this means a change in the content and style of politics , " he said .
" then the hard work will begin .
our leader , angela merkel , will carry out the kind of economic reforms that were implemented in britain over the last 15 years . "
merkel on a roll opinion polls show the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- way ahead of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with mrs merkel poised to become germany 's first female leader .
it was the cdu victory in the former spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia in may that prompted mr schroeder to call an early election .
the cdu 's angela merkel has a comfortable lead in opinion polls the first step towards that will be friday 's vote of confidence in the bundestag , where the chancellor wants his own supporters not to back him - so that parliament can be dissolved .
" one can voice confidence in the chancellor by abstaining in the vote ; because this will enable new elections to be held , " explained franz muentefering , the spd leader and close schroeder ally , this week .

" there 's a chance of 25-30 % that the elections wo n't happen because the constitutional court stops the process - or the president does , " explains christoph keese , chief editor of welt am sonntag newspaper .

the constitutional court ruled then that parliament must change the constitution if it wants to dissolve itself .
but it has n't done that . "
economic woes still , the most likely outcome is an early election that produces victory for the cdu and defeat for the spd .
chancellor schroeder 's party has been abandoned by the voters in a series of regional elections , in response to germany 's poor economic performance and unpopular reforms pushed through by his government .
above all , mr schroeder has failed to dent germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rate of around 11.3 % - that is 4.7 million people , according to the latest figures .
but his flagship reforms , cutting cherished welfare benefits , have not only harmed spd support .
they have also led many people to leave the party and form a new alliance with the former east german communists , the pds .
" people do n't feel good about the schroeder government , and the big decline in social welfare has led people to say : we need a strong left-wing party to help us , " says pds mp gesine loetsch .
" we have our core voters in eastern germany , plus former social democrats in the west who were disappointed but now have a new hope . "
the new alliance 's trump card is oskar lafontaine - mr schroeder 's former finance minister who went on to become his nemesis .
" red oskar , " as he is known , is a charismatic figure who could win lots of votes .
the latest opinion poll gave the new left-wing alliance 11 % support .
that could also be a headache for the cdu , potentially depriving angela merkel of a majority in the bundestag .
so if the elections do go ahead it is going to be a long , hot summer of campaigning for all germany 's parties .

the crisis over the constitution has left the eu drifting without an anchor , and the rows over the budget have caused deep divisions .
but the job is particularly awkward for the uk , because of its combative stance on the budget , and its conviction - not universally shared - that the constitution impasse obliges the eu to radically re-think where it is going .
both these big issues could easily be left for the austrian and finnish presidencies to grapple with in 2006 .
but instead the uk seems determined to put on a display worthy of the memory of waterloo and trafalgar , or even the heroic but pointless charge of the light brigade .
will chirac want to be the guy who hands tony blair a great success on a plate ?
it 's pretty unlikely sir stephen wall it is going all out for a budget agreement , and it insists that the constitution crisis is actually an " opportunity " to persuade european partners of the need for liberalising economic reforms .
the uk 's stint at the helm of the council of the european union will be judged partly in terms of the scale of the debate it has provoked on this agenda of jobs , growth and competitiveness and the number of hearts and minds it has won over .
french fury tony blair made an impressive start with his speech in the european parliament on 23 june , but there are many pitfalls and obstacles to negotiate , including the risk of sounding preachy or unsympathetic to european social traditions .

if tony blair wants to have a debate on economic reform , he can not do it by pushing the services directive under the carpet hugo brady centre for european reform a head-on clash with france is also likely on the services directive , which aims to open up the eu 's market in services to real competition .
the uk describes it as " an opportunity to make one of the biggest improvements to the single market since its original creation , potentially creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of euros for the eu economy . "
in france and germany , by contrast , the directive has been described as a recipe for " social dumping " - helping new eu countries with low labour costs to undercut richer competitors .
" we could have real problems with the french here , " says one uk official , " and possibly other countries as well . "
it might be tempting for the british to dilute the directive , or put it on the back burner , but once again they seem to be adopting bulldog tactics .

the good news for the uk is that the new german government may be more enthusiastic about economic liberalisation - the bad news is that it may be opposed to the start of membership talks with turkey on 3 october .
this is a top priority of the uk presidency , but one that may not be easy to deliver .

a country-and-western band provided the music , the beer was flowing , and racks of chickens were sizzling .
but christian wulff , the state 's conservative prime minister and germany 's most popular politician , was licking his lips at the prospect of an altogether different delicacy .
" there will be new elections in germany .
this means a change in the content and style of politics , " he said .
" then the hard work will begin .
our leader , angela merkel , will carry out the kind of economic reforms that were implemented in britain over the last 15 years . "
merkel on a roll opinion polls show the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- way ahead of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , with mrs merkel poised to become germany 's first female leader .
it was the cdu victory in the former spd stronghold of north rhine-westphalia in may that prompted mr schroeder to call an early election .
the cdu 's angela merkel has a comfortable lead in opinion polls the first step towards that will be friday 's vote of confidence in the bundestag , where the chancellor wants his own supporters not to back him - so that parliament can be dissolved .
" one can voice confidence in the chancellor by abstaining in the vote ; because this will enable new elections to be held , " explained franz muentefering , the spd leader and close schroeder ally , this week .
" everyone must decide how he 's going to vote .
it 's an individual decision for every mp . "
but this has met a mixed response from government mps , some of whom are unhappy about the decision to hold an early election .
furthermore , a legal challenge could still derail the whole process .
" there 's a chance of 25-30 % that the elections wo n't happen because the constitutional court stops the process - or the president does , " explains christoph keese , chief editor of welt am sonntag newspaper .
" there was a similar case 20 years ago , when helmut kohl got the bundestag dissolved .
the constitutional court ruled then that parliament must change the constitution if it wants to dissolve itself .
but it has n't done that . "
economic woes still , the most likely outcome is an early election that produces victory for the cdu and defeat for the spd .
chancellor schroeder 's party has been abandoned by the voters in a series of regional elections , in response to germany 's poor economic performance and unpopular reforms pushed through by his government .
above all , mr schroeder has failed to dent germany 's stubbornly high unemployment rate of around 11.3 % - that is 4.7 million people , according to the latest figures .
but his flagship reforms , cutting cherished welfare benefits , have not only harmed spd support .
they have also led many people to leave the party and form a new alliance with the former east german communists , the pds .
" people do n't feel good about the schroeder government , and the big decline in social welfare has led people to say : we need a strong left-wing party to help us , " says pds mp gesine loetsch .
" we have our core voters in eastern germany , plus former social democrats in the west who were disappointed but now have a new hope . "
the new alliance 's trump card is oskar lafontaine - mr schroeder 's former finance minister who went on to become his nemesis .
" red oskar , " as he is known , is a charismatic figure who could win lots of votes .
the latest opinion poll gave the new left-wing alliance 11 % support .
that could also be a headache for the cdu , potentially depriving angela merkel of a majority in the bundestag .
so if the elections do go ahead it is going to be a long , hot summer of campaigning for all germany 's parties .

stephen pound : aspiring chav lampooned by comedians , attacked by social commentators , portrayed by the media as loud , vulgar and abusive , and increasingly seen as a drain on the public finances .
but at least mps are able to speak up for themselves .
is there anyone out there who will take up the cudgels on behalf of that other much maligned social subset - the chav ?
since the word crossed over into the mainstream last year , after first appearing on satirical websites , chav has become a catch-all term for a flash or showy working class person .
everyone from millionaire footballer wayne rooney and his girlfriend colleen to the shoplifting single mother character vicky pollard , from bbc one 's little britain , has been labelled a chav .
the sun newspaper ran a " proud to be chav " campaign .
' underclass ' the word has even entered the dictionary , defined as " a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing " .
i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs lembit opik , lib dem mp but one chav-baiting website sums it up more succinctly as britain 's " new peasant underclass " .
michael collins , author of the likes of us , a biography of the white working classes , says there is nothing new about the middle classes sneering at working class people who are a " bit affluent " or showy .
but the difference with the chav phenomenon , he adds , is that much of the vitriol has come from people " who consider themselves progressive " .
" it has become quite a jokey thing .
but the white working class are the last acceptable group to demonise , " he says .
liverpool mp louise ellman sees parallels with the way liverpudlian youths were labelled " scallies " in the 1980s .
" i think it is all too easy to label other groups with ugly-sounding words .
i think it is negative and not very helpful , " she says .
jealous ealing mp stephen pound says he is happy to be the parliamentary spokesman for the chav nation .
" chavs " have entered the dictionary " i am an aspirant chav .
my off-duty wear is a fulham shirt with ' these colours do n't run ' on it .
i do n't have a lot of gold rings , but i am saving up for them .
my daughter had her ears pierced at a fairly young age , " the labour mp says .
he sees the chav phenomenon as an insidious form of social snobbery .
" people who use the word do n't understand the joy and confidence in display .
they are just jealous that they ca n't play football as well as wayne rooney .
" it is yet another example of class snobbery .
what on earth is wrong with a bit of flash , a bit of bling bling .
it keeps a lot of jewellers in business . "
' snobs ' liberal democrat mp lembit opik says he is angry about the way the word is used to attack young working class people , particularly when it is used in conjunction with other terms , such as " council house scum " .
" the same people who talk about chavs probably used to talk about the lower classes as regrettable and nasty .
it is like the last days of the raj .
" i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs . "
the only way to combat the word , mr opik argues , is to invent labels for people who use it .
" i would describe myself as a taff - a tolerant and friendly fellow , and i would describe who people who use the word chav as baps - boring and pompous snobs . "
here are some of your comments : it may be snobbery , but it 's great fun .
i mean these people are asking for it behaving the way they do .
helen , hampshire uk chavs have votes and can buy newspapers .
that 's the only reason mps and journalists have taken to them .
des , london , uk of course it is classism .
how long did that take everyone to realise .
the growing underclass , which is the result of the widening inequalities -lrb- an inevitable by-product of free-market capitalism -rrb- makes the lives of middle class people -lrb- ironically those who generally perpetuate the problems with their unchecked consumerism -rrb- hell .
the only solace we have lies in " holiday showdown " and " wife swap " where we can escape the realities of a crumbling society and feel superior .
laughing is fine but every conservative vote and every pence moved away from education will ensure the proliferation of " les miserables " .
elizabeth , london , uk snobbery is looking down your nose at someone from a perceived superior position .
criticising delinquents is something completely different .
by the way in northern ireland they are known as spides ...
peter hawkins , belfast , n.ireland chav is a middle class word created to keep working class people down , i bet if you went to a council estate and asked do you think you are a chav ?
most would answer what is one ?
robert vaughan , leeds , uk society inevitably labels groups of people for convenience , some mps need to get a grip and stop being so pc .
lembit opik 's constant pc obsession risks my support of the lib dems .
he 's plainly wrong .
just as it 's perfectly fine to call me a paddy as i 'm irish , it 's perfectly fine to label the vicky pollards of this world as chavs .
i also feel that most chavs are perfectly capable of defending themselves usually in the form of anti-social behaviour .
it 's reality , not snobbery , and these mps do not obviously have to mix with the rest of us who suffer them on a daily basis in many neighbourhoods .
tom stewart , london , uk being a working class man , i find it extremely offensive that the term working class is applied to these creatures , as clearly non of them work .
i think to use such a term is to degrade the contribution the true working classes have made to this country .
simon elworthy , penrith , england i know i 'm going to be called a wishy-washy liberal for saying this , but say it i shall .
why is n't anyone questioning the reason for the existence of chavs in the uk ?
it is hard to deny that this is a nasty and derogatory term for anyone to be labelled with .
but with the uk appearing more and more socially divided at a time when it has never been a richer nation , the question to be asking is whether or not the very existence of chavs is due to the sneering and uncompassionate attitude , typified by the comments made here .
treat people like animals and they behave like animals .
treat people with respect and provide equal educational and social resources and we might find that ' chavs ' are made of better things .
simon pitman , montpellier , france " flash or showy working class person " ?
no , no no .
chavs -lrb- or scallies , as they 're known where i live -rrb- are the dole-dossing , abusive , foul-mouthed , scum types .
townies are their ' gentler ' cousins who , although wearing the same clothes , actually get jobs and try to avoid a criminal record , pregnancy , or both , before having left school .
caroline , manchester yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah but no !
if mp 's want to know why chavs have such a reputation then i suggest that they leave their luxury homes in the country and their apartments in london and take up a 3 month residency in pretty much any inner city area .
i am sure that when their property is then vandalised or they are harassed for no reason , they will see first hand what all the fuss is about .
it is time that mp 's actually took their head out of the sand init !
chris philpott , hull uk i think many people 's problem with chavs is that so many of these " working class " people do n't work .
the resentment the middle classes feel towards them comes from the fact that we pay more and more of our income in tax to keep chavs / neds / scallies in adidas tracksuits , jewellery and trainers which cost more than we can afford after our pay check is cut in half by tax .
what this article does show is that the labour and lib dem parties are happy for this phenomenon to continue .
we need a strong centre right government that will reform the benefits system and force people to work .
ian bruce , stirling , uk i earn a lot less than the " average " wage for people in the uk .
last year less than £ 7k pa .
if i am not " working class " myself i would like to know what is .
i will make fun of chavs if and when i want to .
if i feel that these people look and sound ridiculous i have the freedom of speech -lrb- do n't i ? -rrb- to laugh .
if i think a " chav 'd " out corsa car is stupid , that is my right as a tax payer in this country .
jealous , no i am not i am fairly happy with the life i have .
stop being a sheep mr pound , get off the bandwagon .
go hang around with these chavs for a few weeks , drinking cheap drinks and causing a nuisance .
then see how you feel about the sheep you aspire to be .
paul kirton , peterborough uk i do n't have a problem with anyone based on what they wear , that really is snobbery .
on the other hand i do have a problem with the " chavs " that are openly abusive and threatening , the ones that sit drinking alcohol of any description -lrb- ' cos it makes ' em look hard , innit -rrb- while shouting abuse at passers-by -lrb- wot yer lookin ' at ? -rrb- , and the ones that drive their pride and joy -lrb- usually a badly modified and hideous old peugeot 106 with a mismatched spoiler and half-painted skirts -rrb- around car parks screeching tyres and pumping out music at 2 o 'clock in the morning .
i do n't judge people on style or class or income .
what i have a problem with is wanton idiocy .
adam , woking , uk i think the mps have got this slightly wrong , what chavs wear helps you to identify them , but is n't in itself the reason for singling chavs out ; what people dislike about chavs is their behaviour , which varies but can include such pleasant things as - spitting in the street , shouting at people , throwing kebab wrappers all over the street , throwing up in the street on a night out etc etc .
not all young working class people are chavs , and i would say that people from all classes can be chavs .
the key is bad public behaviour and manners , and no class has the monopoly on that .
amy , reading we are used to hearing some absolute drivel from lembit opik but this takes the biscuit !
chavs they are and chavs they will always be .
uncouth , unattractive and uneducated riff-raff .
if by stating this i am a ' snob ' then i wear this as a badge of honour !
matt , sheffield as a 19 year old , i think some people are a little confused as to what constitutes chavvery .
though i would n't wear such things myself , i have some ' trev ' friends who wear adidas etc , but that does n't make them chavs - in the same way that owning fewer than 10 tracksuits does n't make you exempt .
what makes you a chav is the way you act - generally chavs exclusively hang out with chavs -lrb- how 's that for classism ? ! -rrb- , and are rude and threatening etc to all others that do n't fit into their cliché .
so if stephen pound really wants to be a chav , he 'd better get ready for a change of company !
ros , bristol , uk the term chav may have entered the mainstream , but unfortunately the media and politicians alike have completely misunderstood what it refers to .
chavs -lrb- or neds as they 're known in scotland -rrb- are not characterised by what they wear .
hint : in the acronym ned , the d stands for delinquent .
ian , edinburgh , uk proud to be a chav ?
in this politically correct day and age , no wonder these people are being elevated to the status of decent , while in real life they are little more than arrogant fascist criminals , from my experience .
i would n't be surprised if a new party is formed against chavs .
anyone want to help me to set up the safe thinking unifiying people in desire to get rid of chavs .
the short version ?
stupid chavs !
joseph cullen , luton , uk are the government about to introduce a " chav hatred " law ?
stuart fotheringham , it 's got nothing to do with class .
it 's got everything to do with morons who are proud of their ignorance .
or is it wrong to think that is a bad thing these days ?
steve , uk for the final time being a chav is about attittude not about class !
working class does not equal chav .
a person swearing every other word , having no respect for people and property , and being violent and intimidating - now that 's a chav !
when the prime minister talks about a " lack of respect " in the country we all know what sector of the population he was referring too , even if he did n't realize it himself .
james wilson , nottingham the word " chav " was funny when it was only applied to the people who deserved it - the antisocial , foul mouthed lot who live off the dole and / or child benefits .
unfortunately , it has been hijacked by middle class snobs as a way for them to put the working classes down without looking like snobs -lrb- in their own eyes -rrb- , because calling people chavs is " just a bit of fun " .

treat people with respect and provide equal educational and social resources and we might find that ' chavs ' are made of better things .
simon pitman , montpellier , france " flash or showy working class person " ?
no , no no .
chavs -lrb- or scallies , as they 're known where i live -rrb- are the dole-dossing , abusive , foul-mouthed , scum types .
townies are their ' gentler ' cousins who , although wearing the same clothes , actually get jobs and try to avoid a criminal record , pregnancy , or both , before having left school .
caroline , manchester yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah but no !
if mp 's want to know why chavs have such a reputation then i suggest that they leave their luxury homes in the country and their apartments in london and take up a 3 month residency in pretty much any inner city area .
i am sure that when their property is then vandalised or they are harassed for no reason , they will see first hand what all the fuss is about .
it is time that mp 's actually took their head out of the sand init !
chris philpott , hull uk i think many people 's problem with chavs is that so many of these " working class " people do n't work .
the resentment the middle classes feel towards them comes from the fact that we pay more and more of our income in tax to keep chavs / neds / scallies in adidas tracksuits , jewellery and trainers which cost more than we can afford after our pay check is cut in half by tax .
what this article does show is that the labour and lib dem parties are happy for this phenomenon to continue .
we need a strong centre right government that will reform the benefits system and force people to work .
ian bruce , stirling , uk i earn a lot less than the " average " wage for people in the uk .
last year less than £ 7k pa .
if i am not " working class " myself i would like to know what is .
i will make fun of chavs if and when i want to .
if i feel that these people look and sound ridiculous i have the freedom of speech -lrb- do n't i ? -rrb- to laugh .
if i think a " chav 'd " out corsa car is stupid , that is my right as a tax payer in this country .
jealous , no i am not i am fairly happy with the life i have .
stop being a sheep mr pound , get off the bandwagon .
go hang around with these chavs for a few weeks , drinking cheap drinks and causing a nuisance .
then see how you feel about the sheep you aspire to be .
paul kirton , peterborough uk i do n't have a problem with anyone based on what they wear , that really is snobbery .
on the other hand i do have a problem with the " chavs " that are openly abusive and threatening , the ones that sit drinking alcohol of any description -lrb- ' cos it makes ' em look hard , innit -rrb- while shouting abuse at passers-by -lrb- wot yer lookin ' at ? -rrb- , and the ones that drive their pride and joy -lrb- usually a badly modified and hideous old peugeot 106 with a mismatched spoiler and half-painted skirts -rrb- around car parks screeching tyres and pumping out music at 2 o 'clock in the morning .
i do n't judge people on style or class or income .
what i have a problem with is wanton idiocy .
adam , woking , uk i think the mps have got this slightly wrong , what chavs wear helps you to identify them , but is n't in itself the reason for singling chavs out ; what people dislike about chavs is their behaviour , which varies but can include such pleasant things as - spitting in the street , shouting at people , throwing kebab wrappers all over the street , throwing up in the street on a night out etc etc .
not all young working class people are chavs , and i would say that people from all classes can be chavs .
the key is bad public behaviour and manners , and no class has the monopoly on that .
amy , reading we are used to hearing some absolute drivel from lembit opik but this takes the biscuit !
chavs they are and chavs they will always be .
uncouth , unattractive and uneducated riff-raff .
if by stating this i am a ' snob ' then i wear this as a badge of honour !
matt , sheffield as a 19 year old , i think some people are a little confused as to what constitutes chavvery .
though i would n't wear such things myself , i have some ' trev ' friends who wear adidas etc , but that does n't make them chavs - in the same way that owning fewer than 10 tracksuits does n't make you exempt .
what makes you a chav is the way you act - generally chavs exclusively hang out with chavs -lrb- how 's that for classism ? ! -rrb- , and are rude and threatening etc to all others that do n't fit into their cliché .
so if stephen pound really wants to be a chav , he 'd better get ready for a change of company !
ros , bristol , uk the term chav may have entered the mainstream , but unfortunately the media and politicians alike have completely misunderstood what it refers to .
chavs -lrb- or neds as they 're known in scotland -rrb- are not characterised by what they wear .
hint : in the acronym ned , the d stands for delinquent .
ian , edinburgh , uk proud to be a chav ?
in this politically correct day and age , no wonder these people are being elevated to the status of decent , while in real life they are little more than arrogant fascist criminals , from my experience .
i would n't be surprised if a new party is formed against chavs .
anyone want to help me to set up the safe thinking unifiying people in desire to get rid of chavs .
the short version ?
stupid chavs !
joseph cullen , luton , uk are the government about to introduce a " chav hatred " law ?
stuart fotheringham , it 's got nothing to do with class .
it 's got everything to do with morons who are proud of their ignorance .
or is it wrong to think that is a bad thing these days ?
steve , uk for the final time being a chav is about attittude not about class !
working class does not equal chav .
a person swearing every other word , having no respect for people and property , and being violent and intimidating - now that 's a chav !
when the prime minister talks about a " lack of respect " in the country we all know what sector of the population he was referring too , even if he did n't realize it himself .
james wilson , nottingham the word " chav " was funny when it was only applied to the people who deserved it - the antisocial , foul mouthed lot who live off the dole and / or child benefits .
unfortunately , it has been hijacked by middle class snobs as a way for them to put the working classes down without looking like snobs -lrb- in their own eyes -rrb- , because calling people chavs is " just a bit of fun " .

stephen pound : aspiring chav lampooned by comedians , attacked by social commentators , portrayed by the media as loud , vulgar and abusive , and increasingly seen as a drain on the public finances .
but at least mps are able to speak up for themselves .
is there anyone out there who will take up the cudgels on behalf of that other much maligned social subset - the chav ?
since the word crossed over into the mainstream last year , after first appearing on satirical websites , chav has become a catch-all term for a flash or showy working class person .
everyone from millionaire footballer wayne rooney and his girlfriend colleen to the shoplifting single mother character vicky pollard , from bbc one 's little britain , has been labelled a chav .
the sun newspaper ran a " proud to be chav " campaign .
' underclass ' the word has even entered the dictionary , defined as " a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing " .
i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs lembit opik , lib dem mp but one chav-baiting website sums it up more succinctly as britain 's " new peasant underclass " .
michael collins , author of the likes of us , a biography of the white working classes , says there is nothing new about the middle classes sneering at working class people who are a " bit affluent " or showy .
but the difference with the chav phenomenon , he adds , is that much of the vitriol has come from people " who consider themselves progressive " .
" it has become quite a jokey thing .
but the white working class are the last acceptable group to demonise , " he says .
liverpool mp louise ellman sees parallels with the way liverpudlian youths were labelled " scallies " in the 1980s .
" i think it is all too easy to label other groups with ugly-sounding words .
i think it is negative and not very helpful , " she says .
jealous ealing mp stephen pound says he is happy to be the parliamentary spokesman for the chav nation .
" chavs " have entered the dictionary " i am an aspirant chav .
my off-duty wear is a fulham shirt with ' these colours do n't run ' on it .
i do n't have a lot of gold rings , but i am saving up for them .
my daughter had her ears pierced at a fairly young age , " the labour mp says .
he sees the chav phenomenon as an insidious form of social snobbery .
" people who use the word do n't understand the joy and confidence in display .
they are just jealous that they ca n't play football as well as wayne rooney .
" it is yet another example of class snobbery .
what on earth is wrong with a bit of flash , a bit of bling bling .
it keeps a lot of jewellers in business . "
' snobs ' liberal democrat mp lembit opik says he is angry about the way the word is used to attack young working class people , particularly when it is used in conjunction with other terms , such as " council house scum " .
" the same people who talk about chavs probably used to talk about the lower classes as regrettable and nasty .
it is like the last days of the raj .
" i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs . "
the only way to combat the word , mr opik argues , is to invent labels for people who use it .
" i would describe myself as a taff - a tolerant and friendly fellow , and i would describe who people who use the word chav as baps - boring and pompous snobs . "
here are some of your comments : it may be snobbery , but it 's great fun .
i mean these people are asking for it behaving the way they do .
helen , hampshire uk chavs have votes and can buy newspapers .
that 's the only reason mps and journalists have taken to them .
des , london , uk of course it is classism .
how long did that take everyone to realise .
the growing underclass , which is the result of the widening inequalities -lrb- an inevitable by-product of free-market capitalism -rrb- makes the lives of middle class people -lrb- ironically those who generally perpetuate the problems with their unchecked consumerism -rrb- hell .
the only solace we have lies in " holiday showdown " and " wife swap " where we can escape the realities of a crumbling society and feel superior .
laughing is fine but every conservative vote and every pence moved away from education will ensure the proliferation of " les miserables " .
elizabeth , london , uk snobbery is looking down your nose at someone from a perceived superior position .
criticising delinquents is something completely different .
by the way in northern ireland they are known as spides ...
peter hawkins , belfast , n.ireland chav is a middle class word created to keep working class people down , i bet if you went to a council estate and asked do you think you are a chav ?
most would answer what is one ?
robert vaughan , leeds , uk society inevitably labels groups of people for convenience , some mps need to get a grip and stop being so pc .
lembit opik 's constant pc obsession risks my support of the lib dems .
he 's plainly wrong .
just as it 's perfectly fine to call me a paddy as i 'm irish , it 's perfectly fine to label the vicky pollards of this world as chavs .
i also feel that most chavs are perfectly capable of defending themselves usually in the form of anti-social behaviour .
it 's reality , not snobbery , and these mps do not obviously have to mix with the rest of us who suffer them on a daily basis in many neighbourhoods .
tom stewart , london , uk being a working class man , i find it extremely offensive that the term working class is applied to these creatures , as clearly non of them work .
i think to use such a term is to degrade the contribution the true working classes have made to this country .
simon elworthy , penrith , england i know i 'm going to be called a wishy-washy liberal for saying this , but say it i shall .
why is n't anyone questioning the reason for the existence of chavs in the uk ?
it is hard to deny that this is a nasty and derogatory term for anyone to be labelled with .

adam , woking , uk i think the mps have got this slightly wrong , what chavs wear helps you to identify them , but is n't in itself the reason for singling chavs out ; what people dislike about chavs is their behaviour , which varies but can include such pleasant things as - spitting in the street , shouting at people , throwing kebab wrappers all over the street , throwing up in the street on a night out etc etc .
not all young working class people are chavs , and i would say that people from all classes can be chavs .
the key is bad public behaviour and manners , and no class has the monopoly on that .
amy , reading we are used to hearing some absolute drivel from lembit opik but this takes the biscuit !
chavs they are and chavs they will always be .
uncouth , unattractive and uneducated riff-raff .
if by stating this i am a ' snob ' then i wear this as a badge of honour !
matt , sheffield as a 19 year old , i think some people are a little confused as to what constitutes chavvery .
though i would n't wear such things myself , i have some ' trev ' friends who wear adidas etc , but that does n't make them chavs - in the same way that owning fewer than 10 tracksuits does n't make you exempt .
what makes you a chav is the way you act - generally chavs exclusively hang out with chavs -lrb- how 's that for classism ? ! -rrb- , and are rude and threatening etc to all others that do n't fit into their cliché .
so if stephen pound really wants to be a chav , he 'd better get ready for a change of company !
ros , bristol , uk the term chav may have entered the mainstream , but unfortunately the media and politicians alike have completely misunderstood what it refers to .
chavs -lrb- or neds as they 're known in scotland -rrb- are not characterised by what they wear .
hint : in the acronym ned , the d stands for delinquent .
ian , edinburgh , uk proud to be a chav ?
in this politically correct day and age , no wonder these people are being elevated to the status of decent , while in real life they are little more than arrogant fascist criminals , from my experience .
i would n't be surprised if a new party is formed against chavs .
anyone want to help me to set up the safe thinking unifiying people in desire to get rid of chavs .
the short version ?
stupid chavs !
joseph cullen , luton , uk are the government about to introduce a " chav hatred " law ?
stuart fotheringham , it 's got nothing to do with class .
it 's got everything to do with morons who are proud of their ignorance .
or is it wrong to think that is a bad thing these days ?
steve , uk for the final time being a chav is about attittude not about class !
working class does not equal chav .
a person swearing every other word , having no respect for people and property , and being violent and intimidating - now that 's a chav !
when the prime minister talks about a " lack of respect " in the country we all know what sector of the population he was referring too , even if he did n't realize it himself .
james wilson , nottingham the word " chav " was funny when it was only applied to the people who deserved it - the antisocial , foul mouthed lot who live off the dole and / or child benefits .
unfortunately , it has been hijacked by middle class snobs as a way for them to put the working classes down without looking like snobs -lrb- in their own eyes -rrb- , because calling people chavs is " just a bit of fun " .

stephen pound : aspiring chav lampooned by comedians , attacked by social commentators , portrayed by the media as loud , vulgar and abusive , and increasingly seen as a drain on the public finances .
but at least mps are able to speak up for themselves .
is there anyone out there who will take up the cudgels on behalf of that other much maligned social subset - the chav ?
since the word crossed over into the mainstream last year , after first appearing on satirical websites , chav has become a catch-all term for a flash or showy working class person .
everyone from millionaire footballer wayne rooney and his girlfriend colleen to the shoplifting single mother character vicky pollard , from bbc one 's little britain , has been labelled a chav .
the sun newspaper ran a " proud to be chav " campaign .
' underclass ' the word has even entered the dictionary , defined as " a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing " .
i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs lembit opik , lib dem mp but one chav-baiting website sums it up more succinctly as britain 's " new peasant underclass " .
michael collins , author of the likes of us , a biography of the white working classes , says there is nothing new about the middle classes sneering at working class people who are a " bit affluent " or showy .
but the difference with the chav phenomenon , he adds , is that much of the vitriol has come from people " who consider themselves progressive " .
" it has become quite a jokey thing .
but the white working class are the last acceptable group to demonise , " he says .
liverpool mp louise ellman sees parallels with the way liverpudlian youths were labelled " scallies " in the 1980s .
" i think it is all too easy to label other groups with ugly-sounding words .
i think it is negative and not very helpful , " she says .
jealous ealing mp stephen pound says he is happy to be the parliamentary spokesman for the chav nation .
" chavs " have entered the dictionary " i am an aspirant chav .
my off-duty wear is a fulham shirt with ' these colours do n't run ' on it .
i do n't have a lot of gold rings , but i am saving up for them .
my daughter had her ears pierced at a fairly young age , " the labour mp says .
he sees the chav phenomenon as an insidious form of social snobbery .
" people who use the word do n't understand the joy and confidence in display .
they are just jealous that they ca n't play football as well as wayne rooney .
" it is yet another example of class snobbery .
what on earth is wrong with a bit of flash , a bit of bling bling .
it keeps a lot of jewellers in business . "
' snobs ' liberal democrat mp lembit opik says he is angry about the way the word is used to attack young working class people , particularly when it is used in conjunction with other terms , such as " council house scum " .
" the same people who talk about chavs probably used to talk about the lower classes as regrettable and nasty .
it is like the last days of the raj .
" i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs . "
the only way to combat the word , mr opik argues , is to invent labels for people who use it .
" i would describe myself as a taff - a tolerant and friendly fellow , and i would describe who people who use the word chav as baps - boring and pompous snobs . "
here are some of your comments : it may be snobbery , but it 's great fun .
i mean these people are asking for it behaving the way they do .
helen , hampshire uk chavs have votes and can buy newspapers .
that 's the only reason mps and journalists have taken to them .
des , london , uk of course it is classism .
how long did that take everyone to realise .
the growing underclass , which is the result of the widening inequalities -lrb- an inevitable by-product of free-market capitalism -rrb- makes the lives of middle class people -lrb- ironically those who generally perpetuate the problems with their unchecked consumerism -rrb- hell .
the only solace we have lies in " holiday showdown " and " wife swap " where we can escape the realities of a crumbling society and feel superior .
laughing is fine but every conservative vote and every pence moved away from education will ensure the proliferation of " les miserables " .
elizabeth , london , uk snobbery is looking down your nose at someone from a perceived superior position .
criticising delinquents is something completely different .
by the way in northern ireland they are known as spides ...
peter hawkins , belfast , n.ireland chav is a middle class word created to keep working class people down , i bet if you went to a council estate and asked do you think you are a chav ?
most would answer what is one ?
robert vaughan , leeds , uk society inevitably labels groups of people for convenience , some mps need to get a grip and stop being so pc .
lembit opik 's constant pc obsession risks my support of the lib dems .
he 's plainly wrong .
just as it 's perfectly fine to call me a paddy as i 'm irish , it 's perfectly fine to label the vicky pollards of this world as chavs .
i also feel that most chavs are perfectly capable of defending themselves usually in the form of anti-social behaviour .
it 's reality , not snobbery , and these mps do not obviously have to mix with the rest of us who suffer them on a daily basis in many neighbourhoods .
tom stewart , london , uk being a working class man , i find it extremely offensive that the term working class is applied to these creatures , as clearly non of them work .
i think to use such a term is to degrade the contribution the true working classes have made to this country .
simon elworthy , penrith , england i know i 'm going to be called a wishy-washy liberal for saying this , but say it i shall .
why is n't anyone questioning the reason for the existence of chavs in the uk ?
it is hard to deny that this is a nasty and derogatory term for anyone to be labelled with .
but with the uk appearing more and more socially divided at a time when it has never been a richer nation , the question to be asking is whether or not the very existence of chavs is due to the sneering and uncompassionate attitude , typified by the comments made here .
treat people like animals and they behave like animals .
treat people with respect and provide equal educational and social resources and we might find that ' chavs ' are made of better things .
simon pitman , montpellier , france " flash or showy working class person " ?
no , no no .
chavs -lrb- or scallies , as they 're known where i live -rrb- are the dole-dossing , abusive , foul-mouthed , scum types .
townies are their ' gentler ' cousins who , although wearing the same clothes , actually get jobs and try to avoid a criminal record , pregnancy , or both , before having left school .
caroline , manchester yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah but no !
if mp 's want to know why chavs have such a reputation then i suggest that they leave their luxury homes in the country and their apartments in london and take up a 3 month residency in pretty much any inner city area .
i am sure that when their property is then vandalised or they are harassed for no reason , they will see first hand what all the fuss is about .
it is time that mp 's actually took their head out of the sand init !
chris philpott , hull uk i think many people 's problem with chavs is that so many of these " working class " people do n't work .
the resentment the middle classes feel towards them comes from the fact that we pay more and more of our income in tax to keep chavs / neds / scallies in adidas tracksuits , jewellery and trainers which cost more than we can afford after our pay check is cut in half by tax .
what this article does show is that the labour and lib dem parties are happy for this phenomenon to continue .
we need a strong centre right government that will reform the benefits system and force people to work .
ian bruce , stirling , uk i earn a lot less than the " average " wage for people in the uk .
last year less than £ 7k pa .
if i am not " working class " myself i would like to know what is .
i will make fun of chavs if and when i want to .
if i feel that these people look and sound ridiculous i have the freedom of speech -lrb- do n't i ? -rrb- to laugh .
if i think a " chav 'd " out corsa car is stupid , that is my right as a tax payer in this country .
jealous , no i am not i am fairly happy with the life i have .
stop being a sheep mr pound , get off the bandwagon .
go hang around with these chavs for a few weeks , drinking cheap drinks and causing a nuisance .
then see how you feel about the sheep you aspire to be .
paul kirton , peterborough uk i do n't have a problem with anyone based on what they wear , that really is snobbery .
on the other hand i do have a problem with the " chavs " that are openly abusive and threatening , the ones that sit drinking alcohol of any description -lrb- ' cos it makes ' em look hard , innit -rrb- while shouting abuse at passers-by -lrb- wot yer lookin ' at ? -rrb- , and the ones that drive their pride and joy -lrb- usually a badly modified and hideous old peugeot 106 with a mismatched spoiler and half-painted skirts -rrb- around car parks screeching tyres and pumping out music at 2 o 'clock in the morning .
i do n't judge people on style or class or income .

stephen pound : aspiring chav lampooned by comedians , attacked by social commentators , portrayed by the media as loud , vulgar and abusive , and increasingly seen as a drain on the public finances .
but at least mps are able to speak up for themselves .
is there anyone out there who will take up the cudgels on behalf of that other much maligned social subset - the chav ?
since the word crossed over into the mainstream last year , after first appearing on satirical websites , chav has become a catch-all term for a flash or showy working class person .
everyone from millionaire footballer wayne rooney and his girlfriend colleen to the shoplifting single mother character vicky pollard , from bbc one 's little britain , has been labelled a chav .
the sun newspaper ran a " proud to be chav " campaign .
' underclass ' the word has even entered the dictionary , defined as " a young working class person who dresses in casual sports clothing " .
i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs lembit opik , lib dem mp but one chav-baiting website sums it up more succinctly as britain 's " new peasant underclass " .
michael collins , author of the likes of us , a biography of the white working classes , says there is nothing new about the middle classes sneering at working class people who are a " bit affluent " or showy .
but the difference with the chav phenomenon , he adds , is that much of the vitriol has come from people " who consider themselves progressive " .
" it has become quite a jokey thing .
but the white working class are the last acceptable group to demonise , " he says .
liverpool mp louise ellman sees parallels with the way liverpudlian youths were labelled " scallies " in the 1980s .
" i think it is all too easy to label other groups with ugly-sounding words .
i think it is negative and not very helpful , " she says .
jealous ealing mp stephen pound says he is happy to be the parliamentary spokesman for the chav nation .
" chavs " have entered the dictionary " i am an aspirant chav .
my off-duty wear is a fulham shirt with ' these colours do n't run ' on it .
i do n't have a lot of gold rings , but i am saving up for them .
my daughter had her ears pierced at a fairly young age , " the labour mp says .
he sees the chav phenomenon as an insidious form of social snobbery .
" people who use the word do n't understand the joy and confidence in display .
they are just jealous that they ca n't play football as well as wayne rooney .
" it is yet another example of class snobbery .
what on earth is wrong with a bit of flash , a bit of bling bling .
it keeps a lot of jewellers in business . "
' snobs ' liberal democrat mp lembit opik says he is angry about the way the word is used to attack young working class people , particularly when it is used in conjunction with other terms , such as " council house scum " .
" the same people who talk about chavs probably used to talk about the lower classes as regrettable and nasty .
it is like the last days of the raj .
" i do feel strongly that people who think this is a genuine label are really only labelling themselves as snobs . "
the only way to combat the word , mr opik argues , is to invent labels for people who use it .
" i would describe myself as a taff - a tolerant and friendly fellow , and i would describe who people who use the word chav as baps - boring and pompous snobs . "
here are some of your comments : it may be snobbery , but it 's great fun .
i mean these people are asking for it behaving the way they do .
helen , hampshire uk chavs have votes and can buy newspapers .
that 's the only reason mps and journalists have taken to them .
des , london , uk of course it is classism .
how long did that take everyone to realise .
the growing underclass , which is the result of the widening inequalities -lrb- an inevitable by-product of free-market capitalism -rrb- makes the lives of middle class people -lrb- ironically those who generally perpetuate the problems with their unchecked consumerism -rrb- hell .
the only solace we have lies in " holiday showdown " and " wife swap " where we can escape the realities of a crumbling society and feel superior .
laughing is fine but every conservative vote and every pence moved away from education will ensure the proliferation of " les miserables " .
elizabeth , london , uk snobbery is looking down your nose at someone from a perceived superior position .
criticising delinquents is something completely different .
by the way in northern ireland they are known as spides ...
peter hawkins , belfast , n.ireland chav is a middle class word created to keep working class people down , i bet if you went to a council estate and asked do you think you are a chav ?
most would answer what is one ?
robert vaughan , leeds , uk society inevitably labels groups of people for convenience , some mps need to get a grip and stop being so pc .
lembit opik 's constant pc obsession risks my support of the lib dems .
he 's plainly wrong .
just as it 's perfectly fine to call me a paddy as i 'm irish , it 's perfectly fine to label the vicky pollards of this world as chavs .
i also feel that most chavs are perfectly capable of defending themselves usually in the form of anti-social behaviour .
it 's reality , not snobbery , and these mps do not obviously have to mix with the rest of us who suffer them on a daily basis in many neighbourhoods .
tom stewart , london , uk being a working class man , i find it extremely offensive that the term working class is applied to these creatures , as clearly non of them work .
i think to use such a term is to degrade the contribution the true working classes have made to this country .
simon elworthy , penrith , england i know i 'm going to be called a wishy-washy liberal for saying this , but say it i shall .
why is n't anyone questioning the reason for the existence of chavs in the uk ?
it is hard to deny that this is a nasty and derogatory term for anyone to be labelled with .
but with the uk appearing more and more socially divided at a time when it has never been a richer nation , the question to be asking is whether or not the very existence of chavs is due to the sneering and uncompassionate attitude , typified by the comments made here .
treat people like animals and they behave like animals .
treat people with respect and provide equal educational and social resources and we might find that ' chavs ' are made of better things .
simon pitman , montpellier , france " flash or showy working class person " ?
no , no no .
chavs -lrb- or scallies , as they 're known where i live -rrb- are the dole-dossing , abusive , foul-mouthed , scum types .
townies are their ' gentler ' cousins who , although wearing the same clothes , actually get jobs and try to avoid a criminal record , pregnancy , or both , before having left school .
caroline , manchester yeah but no but yeah but no but yeah but no !
if mp 's want to know why chavs have such a reputation then i suggest that they leave their luxury homes in the country and their apartments in london and take up a 3 month residency in pretty much any inner city area .
i am sure that when their property is then vandalised or they are harassed for no reason , they will see first hand what all the fuss is about .
it is time that mp 's actually took their head out of the sand init !
chris philpott , hull uk i think many people 's problem with chavs is that so many of these " working class " people do n't work .
the resentment the middle classes feel towards them comes from the fact that we pay more and more of our income in tax to keep chavs / neds / scallies in adidas tracksuits , jewellery and trainers which cost more than we can afford after our pay check is cut in half by tax .
what this article does show is that the labour and lib dem parties are happy for this phenomenon to continue .
we need a strong centre right government that will reform the benefits system and force people to work .
ian bruce , stirling , uk i earn a lot less than the " average " wage for people in the uk .
last year less than £ 7k pa .
if i am not " working class " myself i would like to know what is .
i will make fun of chavs if and when i want to .
if i feel that these people look and sound ridiculous i have the freedom of speech -lrb- do n't i ? -rrb- to laugh .
if i think a " chav 'd " out corsa car is stupid , that is my right as a tax payer in this country .
jealous , no i am not i am fairly happy with the life i have .
stop being a sheep mr pound , get off the bandwagon .
go hang around with these chavs for a few weeks , drinking cheap drinks and causing a nuisance .
then see how you feel about the sheep you aspire to be .
paul kirton , peterborough uk i do n't have a problem with anyone based on what they wear , that really is snobbery .
on the other hand i do have a problem with the " chavs " that are openly abusive and threatening , the ones that sit drinking alcohol of any description -lrb- ' cos it makes ' em look hard , innit -rrb- while shouting abuse at passers-by -lrb- wot yer lookin ' at ? -rrb- , and the ones that drive their pride and joy -lrb- usually a badly modified and hideous old peugeot 106 with a mismatched spoiler and half-painted skirts -rrb- around car parks screeching tyres and pumping out music at 2 o 'clock in the morning .
i do n't judge people on style or class or income .
what i have a problem with is wanton idiocy .
adam , woking , uk i think the mps have got this slightly wrong , what chavs wear helps you to identify them , but is n't in itself the reason for singling chavs out ; what people dislike about chavs is their behaviour , which varies but can include such pleasant things as - spitting in the street , shouting at people , throwing kebab wrappers all over the street , throwing up in the street on a night out etc etc .
not all young working class people are chavs , and i would say that people from all classes can be chavs .
the key is bad public behaviour and manners , and no class has the monopoly on that .
amy , reading we are used to hearing some absolute drivel from lembit opik but this takes the biscuit !
chavs they are and chavs they will always be .
uncouth , unattractive and uneducated riff-raff .
if by stating this i am a ' snob ' then i wear this as a badge of honour !
matt , sheffield as a 19 year old , i think some people are a little confused as to what constitutes chavvery .
though i would n't wear such things myself , i have some ' trev ' friends who wear adidas etc , but that does n't make them chavs - in the same way that owning fewer than 10 tracksuits does n't make you exempt .
what makes you a chav is the way you act - generally chavs exclusively hang out with chavs -lrb- how 's that for classism ? ! -rrb- , and are rude and threatening etc to all others that do n't fit into their cliché .
so if stephen pound really wants to be a chav , he 'd better get ready for a change of company !
ros , bristol , uk the term chav may have entered the mainstream , but unfortunately the media and politicians alike have completely misunderstood what it refers to .
chavs -lrb- or neds as they 're known in scotland -rrb- are not characterised by what they wear .
hint : in the acronym ned , the d stands for delinquent .
ian , edinburgh , uk proud to be a chav ?
in this politically correct day and age , no wonder these people are being elevated to the status of decent , while in real life they are little more than arrogant fascist criminals , from my experience .
i would n't be surprised if a new party is formed against chavs .
anyone want to help me to set up the safe thinking unifiying people in desire to get rid of chavs .
the short version ?
stupid chavs !
joseph cullen , luton , uk are the government about to introduce a " chav hatred " law ?
stuart fotheringham , it 's got nothing to do with class .
it 's got everything to do with morons who are proud of their ignorance .
or is it wrong to think that is a bad thing these days ?
steve , uk for the final time being a chav is about attittude not about class !
working class does not equal chav .
a person swearing every other word , having no respect for people and property , and being violent and intimidating - now that 's a chav !
when the prime minister talks about a " lack of respect " in the country we all know what sector of the population he was referring too , even if he did n't realize it himself .
james wilson , nottingham the word " chav " was funny when it was only applied to the people who deserved it - the antisocial , foul mouthed lot who live off the dole and / or child benefits .
unfortunately , it has been hijacked by middle class snobs as a way for them to put the working classes down without looking like snobs -lrb- in their own eyes -rrb- , because calling people chavs is " just a bit of fun " .

the images will feature caravan sites in east london where the youngsters and their families have been living for many years .
the london gypsy and traveller unit , in hackney , has supported the project .
the exhibition takes place at the museum of childhood in bethnal green , east london , from 1 july to 31 october .
the children used basic cameras to take the pictures , after participating in photography workshops on the caravan sites in hackney , newham and tower hamlets .
all three areas will be affected by regeneration in the area as well as construction work for the olympics , if london wins its 2012 bid .
