and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .

but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .
" we have to live with the result of the election , and we need a strong government .
therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .
should the process be stretched over days and weeks , it would hurt germany 's growth prospects significantly , especially in the coming year . " politicians need to come to a decision soon , " hüther said .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .
" we have to live with the result of the election , and we need a strong government .
therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .
should the process be stretched over days and weeks , it would hurt germany 's growth prospects significantly , especially in the coming year . " politicians need to come to a decision soon , " hüther said .

greeks do it .
even germans do it - just not as often . when it comes to making sweet , sweet love , men and women from the teutonic north are - it seems - not as needy as their european neighbors in the south , according to a survey by the consumer group gfk in nuremberg . one in every five of the 916 germans surveyed said they are satisfied if they have sex less than once a week .
a full 28 percent think that once a week is good enough .
and although 37 percent say they need a little lovin ' twice a week , they pale in comparison to the 18,000 other people surveyed in the rest of europe and the united states .
one in two outside germany needs it at least twice a week .
so what does this tell us ?
it could tell us that the germans are merely more truthful when it comes to answering sex survey questions .
one in every four greeks , for example , say they are n't satisfied unless they have sex at least five times a week - something anyone who 's lived through a sweltering summer in a country with more than its fair share of malfunctioning air conditioning systems finds hard to believe . but , if taken with another nugget of data provided by the gfk researchers , the need for less sex is quite simple .
like the dutch and the belgians , germans do n't think much of their domestic lovers .
only 15 percent say the best sex to be had is in-country . the overwhelming majority believe italy is the place for foreign affairs .
and 69 percent of the italians , by the way , agree . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de money over sex any day given the choice between hot sex and cold , hard cash , germans say they 'll take the dough .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .
" without a new start that has growth and employment as its top priority , that downward trend will continue .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 rivals vow more talks to break deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- remains sure she 'll lead the country first coalition talks between germany 's two biggest parties broke up thursday with conservative leader angela merkel saying there were " clear differences " between her and chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling party . " differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .
" without a new start that has growth and employment as its top priority , that downward trend will continue .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 in german politics , small is beautiful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small parties , like the left party -lrb- l -rrb- , put up some big numbers the country 's big parties were the big losers in sunday 's elections .
and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .
in the netherlands , the social democrats and neo-liberal party governed for 20 years until 2002 . germany 's political leadership would be well-served to follow the lead of other countries , say the election experts .
" by committing themselves to just one coalition partner , the major parties have unnecessarily limited their possibilities , " said niedermayer . angela göpfert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .
that may be one reason gerhard schröder insists he should remain chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 fill it up with natural großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel exists in varying degrees of environmental friendliness since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .
though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .
" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .
for these reasons , " few new diesel cars are receiving approval to use biodiesel , " andrea gärtner , a technician for germany 's largest auto club , told the dpa news agency . consumers have two options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen 's golf 5 can be converted to run on biodiesel there are ecological advantages and disadvantages to using biological fuels , according to guido reinhardt of the institute for energy and environmental research in heidelberg . " the advantages of the currently used biofuels will probably increase as compared to conventional fuels , " he wrote in a 2004 study before concluding that there is still much more research to be done . until additional answers on the climate effect of biodiesel are found , drivers are left with two options , according to retzlaff . " consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals . " transport companies interested in biodiesel biodiesel may have problems in the consumer market , but it plays an important role for trucking and delivery companies looking to save on fuel costs .
transportation companies have found switching to biodiesel to be especially profitable over the long-term , according to retzlaff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " biodiesel will meet the updated european standards for trucks and commercial vehicles , " she said .
" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth . " germany has technological head start , and there is a demand for experience in running both biodiesel operations and facilities , " she said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants smarter cars , safer roads think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .

rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .
for these reasons , " few new diesel cars are receiving approval to use biodiesel , " andrea gärtner , a technician for germany 's largest auto club , told the dpa news agency . consumers have two options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen 's golf 5 can be converted to run on biodiesel there are ecological advantages and disadvantages to using biological fuels , according to guido reinhardt of the institute for energy and environmental research in heidelberg . " the advantages of the currently used biofuels will probably increase as compared to conventional fuels , " he wrote in a 2004 study before concluding that there is still much more research to be done . until additional answers on the climate effect of biodiesel are found , drivers are left with two options , according to retzlaff . " consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals . " transport companies interested in biodiesel biodiesel may have problems in the consumer market , but it plays an important role for trucking and delivery companies looking to save on fuel costs .
transportation companies have found switching to biodiesel to be especially profitable over the long-term , according to retzlaff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " biodiesel will meet the updated european standards for trucks and commercial vehicles , " she said .
" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth . " germany has technological head start , and there is a demand for experience in running both biodiesel operations and facilities , " she said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants smarter cars , safer roads think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios .

back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok .

the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios .

but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common . " the parties are diametrically opposed on key issues such as turkey 's bid to join the european union , the phase-out of nuclear power and taxation policy . " i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " roth said . foreign minister joschka fischer , the highest-profile green , has said it is " improbable " that his party would take part in the next coalition .
fischer announced his withdrawal from the greens leadership should his party go into opposition . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in german politics , small is beautiful the country 's big parties were the big losers in sunday 's elections .

merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .

hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .

in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .
" without a new start that has growth and employment as its top priority , that downward trend will continue .

the inconclusive poll has left schröder and merkel jockeying for power .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .

the dispute first arose when fifa - in a first in world cup history - filed for brand protection for the terms " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 " and furnished an entire list of products which advertisers could n't use without fifa 's permission .
ferrero , which is headquartered in frankfurt and which has been providing small cards of soccer players with its candy - a popular souvenir among socccer fans - during soccer world cups and european championships since 1982 , protested against the rigid conditions and scored a partial victory at the federal patents office in munich .
the judges there decided that brand protection did n't apply to a part of the fifa list .
that includes products such as cards and pictures of players and stickers . dw-world.de attendances swell at world cup stadiums over the past five years average attendances in the bundesliga have been recorded at a respectable 30,000 but crowds have soared since the introduction of world cup stadiums last season .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .

hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .

in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .
" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .
for these reasons , " few new diesel cars are receiving approval to use biodiesel , " andrea gärtner , a technician for germany 's largest auto club , told the dpa news agency . consumers have two options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen 's golf 5 can be converted to run on biodiesel there are ecological advantages and disadvantages to using biological fuels , according to guido reinhardt of the institute for energy and environmental research in heidelberg . " the advantages of the currently used biofuels will probably increase as compared to conventional fuels , " he wrote in a 2004 study before concluding that there is still much more research to be done . until additional answers on the climate effect of biodiesel are found , drivers are left with two options , according to retzlaff . " consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals . " transport companies interested in biodiesel biodiesel may have problems in the consumer market , but it plays an important role for trucking and delivery companies looking to save on fuel costs .
transportation companies have found switching to biodiesel to be especially profitable over the long-term , according to retzlaff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " biodiesel will meet the updated european standards for trucks and commercial vehicles , " she said .
" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth . " germany has technological head start , and there is a demand for experience in running both biodiesel operations and facilities , " she said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants smarter cars , safer roads think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .
-lrb- sept .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .
" we have to live with the result of the election , and we need a strong government .
therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .
should the process be stretched over days and weeks , it would hurt germany 's growth prospects significantly , especially in the coming year . " politicians need to come to a decision soon , " hüther said .

" the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .
" we have to live with the result of the election , and we need a strong government .
therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .
should the process be stretched over days and weeks , it would hurt germany 's growth prospects significantly , especially in the coming year . " politicians need to come to a decision soon , " hüther said .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .
" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .
for these reasons , " few new diesel cars are receiving approval to use biodiesel , " andrea gärtner , a technician for germany 's largest auto club , told the dpa news agency . consumers have two options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen 's golf 5 can be converted to run on biodiesel there are ecological advantages and disadvantages to using biological fuels , according to guido reinhardt of the institute for energy and environmental research in heidelberg .

" consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .

biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .
" without a new start that has growth and employment as its top priority , that downward trend will continue .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .
" we have to live with the result of the election , and we need a strong government .
therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .
should the process be stretched over days and weeks , it would hurt germany 's growth prospects significantly , especially in the coming year . " politicians need to come to a decision soon , " hüther said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 fill it up with natural großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel exists in varying degrees of environmental friendliness since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .
though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .
" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .
for these reasons , " few new diesel cars are receiving approval to use biodiesel , " andrea gärtner , a technician for germany 's largest auto club , told the dpa news agency . consumers have two options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen 's golf 5 can be converted to run on biodiesel there are ecological advantages and disadvantages to using biological fuels , according to guido reinhardt of the institute for energy and environmental research in heidelberg . " the advantages of the currently used biofuels will probably increase as compared to conventional fuels , " he wrote in a 2004 study before concluding that there is still much more research to be done . until additional answers on the climate effect of biodiesel are found , drivers are left with two options , according to retzlaff . " consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals . " transport companies interested in biodiesel biodiesel may have problems in the consumer market , but it plays an important role for trucking and delivery companies looking to save on fuel costs .
transportation companies have found switching to biodiesel to be especially profitable over the long-term , according to retzlaff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " biodiesel will meet the updated european standards for trucks and commercial vehicles , " she said .
" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth . " germany has technological head start , and there is a demand for experience in running both biodiesel operations and facilities , " she said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants smarter cars , safer roads think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common . " the parties are diametrically opposed on key issues such as turkey 's bid to join the european union , the phase-out of nuclear power and taxation policy . " i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " roth said . foreign minister joschka fischer , the highest-profile green , has said it is " improbable " that his party would take part in the next coalition .
fischer announced his withdrawal from the greens leadership should his party go into opposition . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in german politics , small is beautiful the country 's big parties were the big losers in sunday 's elections .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common . " the parties are diametrically opposed on key issues such as turkey 's bid to join the european union , the phase-out of nuclear power and taxation policy . " i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " roth said . foreign minister joschka fischer , the highest-profile green , has said it is " improbable " that his party would take part in the next coalition .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .
in the netherlands , the social democrats and neo-liberal party governed for 20 years until 2002 . germany 's political leadership would be well-served to follow the lead of other countries , say the election experts .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .

but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common . " the parties are diametrically opposed on key issues such as turkey 's bid to join the european union , the phase-out of nuclear power and taxation policy . " i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " roth said . foreign minister joschka fischer , the highest-profile green , has said it is " improbable " that his party would take part in the next coalition .

the dispute first arose when fifa - in a first in world cup history - filed for brand protection for the terms " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 " and furnished an entire list of products which advertisers could n't use without fifa 's permission .
ferrero , which is headquartered in frankfurt and which has been providing small cards of soccer players with its candy - a popular souvenir among socccer fans - during soccer world cups and european championships since 1982 , protested against the rigid conditions and scored a partial victory at the federal patents office in munich .
the judges there decided that brand protection did n't apply to a part of the fifa list .

the dispute first arose when fifa - in a first in world cup history - filed for brand protection for the terms " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 " and furnished an entire list of products which advertisers could n't use without fifa 's permission .
ferrero , which is headquartered in frankfurt and which has been providing small cards of soccer players with its candy - a popular souvenir among socccer fans - during soccer world cups and european championships since 1982 , protested against the rigid conditions and scored a partial victory at the federal patents office in munich .
the judges there decided that brand protection did n't apply to a part of the fifa list .
that includes products such as cards and pictures of players and stickers . dw-world.de attendances swell at world cup stadiums over the past five years average attendances in the bundesliga have been recorded at a respectable 30,000 but crowds have soared since the introduction of world cup stadiums last season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 rivals vow more talks to break deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- remains sure she 'll lead the country first coalition talks between germany 's two biggest parties broke up thursday with conservative leader angela merkel saying there were " clear differences " between her and chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling party . " differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .

therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .

" no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common . " the parties are diametrically opposed on key issues such as turkey 's bid to join the european union , the phase-out of nuclear power and taxation policy . " i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " roth said . foreign minister joschka fischer , the highest-profile green , has said it is " improbable " that his party would take part in the next coalition .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .
the pro-environment party 's co-president claudia roth said that meeting would merely serve " to find out what we have in common . " the parties are diametrically opposed on key issues such as turkey 's bid to join the european union , the phase-out of nuclear power and taxation policy . " i am extraordinarily skeptical about working with the christian union , " roth said . foreign minister joschka fischer , the highest-profile green , has said it is " improbable " that his party would take part in the next coalition .
fischer announced his withdrawal from the greens leadership should his party go into opposition . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in german politics , small is beautiful the country 's big parties were the big losers in sunday 's elections .

greeks do it .
even germans do it - just not as often . when it comes to making sweet , sweet love , men and women from the teutonic north are - it seems - not as needy as their european neighbors in the south , according to a survey by the consumer group gfk in nuremberg . one in every five of the 916 germans surveyed said they are satisfied if they have sex less than once a week .
a full 28 percent think that once a week is good enough .
and although 37 percent say they need a little lovin ' twice a week , they pale in comparison to the 18,000 other people surveyed in the rest of europe and the united states .
one in two outside germany needs it at least twice a week .
so what does this tell us ?
it could tell us that the germans are merely more truthful when it comes to answering sex survey questions .
one in every four greeks , for example , say they are n't satisfied unless they have sex at least five times a week - something anyone who 's lived through a sweltering summer in a country with more than its fair share of malfunctioning air conditioning systems finds hard to believe . but , if taken with another nugget of data provided by the gfk researchers , the need for less sex is quite simple .
like the dutch and the belgians , germans do n't think much of their domestic lovers .
only 15 percent say the best sex to be had is in-country . the overwhelming majority believe italy is the place for foreign affairs .
and 69 percent of the italians , by the way , agree . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de money over sex any day given the choice between hot sex and cold , hard cash , germans say they 'll take the dough .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .

" consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals . " transport companies interested in biodiesel biodiesel may have problems in the consumer market , but it plays an important role for trucking and delivery companies looking to save on fuel costs .
transportation companies have found switching to biodiesel to be especially profitable over the long-term , according to retzlaff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " biodiesel will meet the updated european standards for trucks and commercial vehicles , " she said .
" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth . " germany has technological head start , and there is a demand for experience in running both biodiesel operations and facilities , " she said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants smarter cars , safer roads think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .

the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 germany 's cdu , spd start coalition talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel both want to triumph in the race for chancellor germany 's christian democrats met for initial coalition talks with chancellor gerhard schröder 's spd on thursday .
but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 in german politics , small is beautiful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small parties , like the left party -lrb- l -rrb- , put up some big numbers the country 's big parties were the big losers in sunday 's elections .
and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios .

" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .
in the netherlands , the social democrats and neo-liberal party governed for 20 years until 2002 . germany 's political leadership would be well-served to follow the lead of other countries , say the election experts .
" by committing themselves to just one coalition partner , the major parties have unnecessarily limited their possibilities , " said niedermayer . angela göpfert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .
and in cologne and rostock , they focus on cultural activities and promoting women . cornelia schäfer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .
" we 've been on a economic downtrend for the past three years that needs to be stopped , " said dieter hundt , the head of the bda employers association .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .

groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .

" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .

" consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .

to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals .

" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios .

but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .

the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .
the christian union parties and the fdp agreed on thursday to pursue talks to form a coalition with the green party . political stalemate could hurt the economy business leaders meanwhile are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks .
this could delay urgently needed economic reforms and do nothing to cut the 11.4 percent unemployment rate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel has her sights set on the chancellorship the private sector had hoped that the 51-year-old merkel would secure a ruling majority , equipped with a mandate to shake up the country 's stagnating economy .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign reduced to less than one percent by schröder 's party on election day . the conservatives ' three-seat advantage is insufficient to form a government , although merkel said she has won the right to govern the country . this result prompted schröder to seize the initiative and claim he had a mandate to remain chancellor despite the fact his party finished second . spd wants schröder to remain chancellor on wednesday , the spd became the first party to launch into talks with potential coalition partners .
müntefering tested the waters in talks with the greens , the junior partners in the outgoing coalition .
he made it clear that his aim was to see schröder continue as chancellor for a third term . müntefering and the greens said the two parties hoped to continue working together in government .
but they acknowledged they would need another partner to form a ruling majority . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party leader franz müntefering with the bigger picture " we know we need a third party at the table , " müntefering said after the meeting .
he added that he would like that partner to be the fdp . the fdp , though , has ruled out helping schröder or his party cling to power .
müntefering criticized the fdp for its refusal to negotiate . " those who resist , resist what democracy expects of politicians , " he said . can green and black see eye-to-eye ? after the cdu meets the spd , the conservatives will speak to the greens on friday .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .
" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .

" the advantages of the currently used biofuels will probably increase as compared to conventional fuels , " he wrote in a 2004 study before concluding that there is still much more research to be done . until additional answers on the climate effect of biodiesel are found , drivers are left with two options , according to retzlaff . " consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : finding the will to compromise in germany jamaica in germany ?
the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .

given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .

but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .

" no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : finding the will to compromise in germany jamaica in germany ?
the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .

22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 in german politics , small is beautiful großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small parties , like the left party -lrb- l -rrb- , put up some big numbers the country 's big parties were the big losers in sunday 's elections .
and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .
in the netherlands , the social democrats and neo-liberal party governed for 20 years until 2002 . germany 's political leadership would be well-served to follow the lead of other countries , say the election experts .
" by committing themselves to just one coalition partner , the major parties have unnecessarily limited their possibilities , " said niedermayer . angela göpfert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

greeks do it .
even germans do it - just not as often . when it comes to making sweet , sweet love , men and women from the teutonic north are - it seems - not as needy as their european neighbors in the south , according to a survey by the consumer group gfk in nuremberg . one in every five of the 916 germans surveyed said they are satisfied if they have sex less than once a week .
a full 28 percent think that once a week is good enough .
and although 37 percent say they need a little lovin ' twice a week , they pale in comparison to the 18,000 other people surveyed in the rest of europe and the united states .
one in two outside germany needs it at least twice a week .
so what does this tell us ?
it could tell us that the germans are merely more truthful when it comes to answering sex survey questions .
one in every four greeks , for example , say they are n't satisfied unless they have sex at least five times a week - something anyone who 's lived through a sweltering summer in a country with more than its fair share of malfunctioning air conditioning systems finds hard to believe . but , if taken with another nugget of data provided by the gfk researchers , the need for less sex is quite simple .
like the dutch and the belgians , germans do n't think much of their domestic lovers .
only 15 percent say the best sex to be had is in-country . the overwhelming majority believe italy is the place for foreign affairs .
and 69 percent of the italians , by the way , agree . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de money over sex any day given the choice between hot sex and cold , hard cash , germans say they 'll take the dough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.09.2005 sisterhoods make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the community reaches out to single mothers and older women for centuries , beguine communities devoted themselves to a life of prayer and charitable work .
germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .
and in cologne and rostock , they focus on cultural activities and promoting women . cornelia schäfer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .
and in cologne and rostock , they focus on cultural activities and promoting women . cornelia schäfer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "

before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .

" among the two million defectors there must surely have been some men who wanted to deny the female candidate a victory , " schwarzer told afp .
merkel 's conservatives won a slim victory over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , finishing with a three-seat advantage in parliament that is insufficient to form a government .
the christian democrats held a double-digit lead over schröder 's party early in the election campaign but he won back support in the last weeks before the poll in a tour de force , closing the gap between their parties to less than one percent .
schwarzer said schröder enjoyed a clear advantage over merkel because the game of german politics was played by male rules .
" it is everything from the deep voice to declaring his love for his wife in the television duel , " she said , adding that he behaved like a bully towards his female challenger in one of their two tv debates . "
schröder behaved like a towering tyrant who is not used to finding himself on an equal footing with a woman . " the inconclusive result of the election has left germany in political paralysis , with no party holding enough seats to rule and both merkel and schröder claiming the right to be chancellor . dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

but during his nine-year stint , he worked with konwitschny 11 times in critically acclaimed productions such as richard wagner 's " lohengrin " and " die meistersinger von nuernberg " , carl maria von weber 's " der freischuetz " , giuseppe verdi 's " don carlos " , alban berg 's " wozzeck " and " lulu " , arnold schönberg 's " moses und aron " and wolfgang amadeus mozart 's " la clemenza di tito " .
coming second behind hamburg was frankfurt 's opera house , which last won the title " opera house of the year " in 2003 .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

" schily came up with the idea of such a system after countries struggled to trace missing nationals in the wake of the tsunami in southern asia in december last year which claimed 217,000 lives .
the president of interpol , south africa 's jackie selebi , said the international criminal police organization also planned to establish a " crisis fund " to help local authorities in areas struck by natural disasters . the general assembly this week also decided that interpol will cooperate more closely with the united nations and the european police organization europol in efforts to fight terrorism . dw-world.de predicting storms before they strike in the shadow of hurricane katrina , a team of german and british scientists are developing tools to detect early warning signs of storms by studying what triggers them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc feminist says machos cost merkel votes angela merkel 's failure to win a clear majority in the general election on sunday . alice schwarzer , editor of the feminist magazine emma , said she believed many of the supporters of merkel 's christian democrats who defected on voting day did so because they did not want a woman to become german chancellor .
" among the two million defectors there must surely have been some men who wanted to deny the female candidate a victory , " schwarzer told afp .
merkel 's conservatives won a slim victory over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , finishing with a three-seat advantage in parliament that is insufficient to form a government .
the christian democrats held a double-digit lead over schröder 's party early in the election campaign but he won back support in the last weeks before the poll in a tour de force , closing the gap between their parties to less than one percent .
schwarzer said schröder enjoyed a clear advantage over merkel because the game of german politics was played by male rules .
" it is everything from the deep voice to declaring his love for his wife in the television duel , " she said , adding that he behaved like a bully towards his female challenger in one of their two tv debates . "
schröder behaved like a towering tyrant who is not used to finding himself on an equal footing with a woman . " the inconclusive result of the election has left germany in political paralysis , with no party holding enough seats to rule and both merkel and schröder claiming the right to be chancellor . dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

" among the two million defectors there must surely have been some men who wanted to deny the female candidate a victory , " schwarzer told afp .
merkel 's conservatives won a slim victory over chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats , finishing with a three-seat advantage in parliament that is insufficient to form a government .
the christian democrats held a double-digit lead over schröder 's party early in the election campaign but he won back support in the last weeks before the poll in a tour de force , closing the gap between their parties to less than one percent .
schwarzer said schröder enjoyed a clear advantage over merkel because the game of german politics was played by male rules .
" it is everything from the deep voice to declaring his love for his wife in the television duel , " she said , adding that he behaved like a bully towards his female challenger in one of their two tv debates . "
schröder behaved like a towering tyrant who is not used to finding himself on an equal footing with a woman . " the inconclusive result of the election has left germany in political paralysis , with no party holding enough seats to rule and both merkel and schröder claiming the right to be chancellor . dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

ferrero , which is headquartered in frankfurt and which has been providing small cards of soccer players with its candy - a popular souvenir among socccer fans - during soccer world cups and european championships since 1982 , protested against the rigid conditions and scored a partial victory at the federal patents office in munich .
the judges there decided that brand protection did n't apply to a part of the fifa list .
that includes products such as cards and pictures of players and stickers . dw-world.de attendances swell at world cup stadiums over the past five years average attendances in the bundesliga have been recorded at a respectable 30,000 but crowds have soared since the introduction of world cup stadiums last season .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .
-lrb- sept .
19 , 2005 -rrb- rivals vow more talks to break deadlock first coalition talks between germany 's two biggest parties broke up thursday with conservative leader angela merkel saying there were " clear differences " between her and chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 fill it up with natural großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biodiesel exists in varying degrees of environmental friendliness since fuel prices have hit the stratosphere , the search is on for alternatives to gasoline and diesel .
though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .
but reaching for the green pump is n't a viable alternative for every diesel car owner . not for newer diesel cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : older diesel cars are more likely to meet with a technician 's approval to use biodiesel " no one should use biodiesel in a car without a manufacture 's release , " said karin retzlaff of the association of the german biofuel industry .
" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .

biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals . " transport companies interested in biodiesel biodiesel may have problems in the consumer market , but it plays an important role for trucking and delivery companies looking to save on fuel costs .
transportation companies have found switching to biodiesel to be especially profitable over the long-term , according to retzlaff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " biodiesel will meet the updated european standards for trucks and commercial vehicles , " she said .
" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth . " germany has technological head start , and there is a demand for experience in running both biodiesel operations and facilities , " she said . sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants smarter cars , safer roads think of road safety , and chances are you imagine a seatbelt .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "

before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it . "
" they can not correct the election result with legal tricks ... it will not work . " business leaders concerned meanwhile german business leaders are worried that the process of forming a government will drag on for weeks , delaying economic reforms seen as urgently needed and doing nothing to cut a crippling 11.4 percent unemployment rate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : finding the will to compromise in germany jamaica in germany ?
the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .
-lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.09.2005 what german business wants post-election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers ' leader dieter hundt wants jamaica in germany business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question . the latest bundestag election showed just how wishy-washy the german electorate is about economic reforms .
back in may , a dissatisfaction among germans with the reform policies of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- led chancellor gerhard schröder to call for a premature election to support his course .
but the election results show that neither the spd with the greens nor the black-yellow cdu and fdp have enough seats to govern .
as a result , germany is facing a clear stalemate for reforms . despite this ambiguity , business leaders and several of germany 's influential economics institutes have expressed preferences about the right coalition to push through the reforms .
the most important thing , they say , is to set a clear sign for a break with the status quo . a mountain of woes as the president of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt belongs to germany 's upper echelon of economic advisers .
he leads one of the country 's most powerful pro-business lobbying and interest groups .
though hundt chooses not to explicitly name his preference for which party is most fit to lead germany , he is unequivocal that germany needs a change - and fast - to rescue it from a " mountain of woes . " to hundt 's chagrin , the mountain of woes has not gotten any smaller following the election .
the party constellation looks to be no more able to bring change to germany than before .
this means that record unemployment , the dramatic budget deficit , the encumbering and costly bureaucracy , and the burdensome social security system wo n't be able to he helped anytime soon .
bad news for business , hundt said . " to all those who are now engaging in exploratory talks , i have some advice : in the last three years we experienced an economic downswing which must be stopped , " he said .
" germany therefore needs a new political leadership that can actively create the necessary conditions for sustainable growth and for increased employment . " jamaica or grand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would jamaica mean for germany ?
given the possibilities , what do germany 's economic experts see as the best coalition ?
hundt is reserved , saying only that there are more similarities between the cdu , fdp , and greens than campaign rhetoric would have one think .
in other words , he seems to prefer a jamaica coalition .
the other option for the pro-business community is the grand coalition between spd and cdu .
the traffic-light coalition of spd , fdp and greens or a minority government are highly unlikely . ulrich blum , the president of the halle institute for economic research , is a proponent of the grand coalition - for a limited time only . " the best solution for germany is a snappy grand coalition with a focused platform , " he told the ruhr nachrichten newspaper . after a few years , the grand coalition would have done all it could do .
in the meanwhile , the bundestag could amend the constitution in order to allow it to dissolve itself .
then a new election could once again offer german voters the chance to decide on the proper direction for germany . blum said that whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder were to lead germany was beside the point .
the important thing , he said , was for germany to have a stable and strong government . the jamaica coalition would not offer this , blum said . " it would be a coalition against the spd , " he said .
" the essential breakthrough in the federalism reforms and voting laws reforms would sink into oblivion . " no time to lose michael hüther , director of the cologne-based institute of the german economy , one of the country 's most influential economic think tanks , made it very clear in berlin on wednesday that he supported a grand coalition .
after presenting an overarching roadmap for economic reform , hüther said that only a strong government would be up to the task . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hüther recommends dancing with your coalition partner " some wise advice is : you have to dance with the girls that are at the fair , " hüther said , referring to the need for potential coalition partners to come together despite differences .
" we have to live with the result of the election , and we need a strong government .
therefore , i have a strong preference for a grand coalition , " he said . whether they prefer the jamaica or the grand coalition , germany 's pro-business economic experts agree that more than anything else , what matters most is a speedy decision .
should the process be stretched over days and weeks , it would hurt germany 's growth prospects significantly , especially in the coming year . " politicians need to come to a decision soon , " hüther said .

but the cdu really wants to form a government with the free democrats and the greens . with no clear election winner , germany is effectively in a state of political paralysis .
but the two main parties are racing to be the first to assemble a feasible coalition government . christian democratic union leader angela merkel and edmund stoiber , head of the cdu 's bavarian system party csu , met with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- on thursday to look into the possibilities of forming a government .
merkel said the differences between the parties were massive but that they would have to deal with the complicated election result in a politically responsible manner and form a stable government . the talks lasted an hour and were overshadowed by the spd 's insistence that it had received the largest portion of votes and thus the mandate to form a government .
the cdu / csu bloc , which has worked together on a national level throughout the postwar period , received 0.9 percent more votes than the spd . the christian union parties and the spd agreed to meet again on wednesday next week .
spd chief franz müntefering said the talks would then focus on content .
if the christian union and the social democrats can reach agreement , a grand coalition of the cdu and spd seems most likely .
this option , however , faces major hurdles .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said the spd would not join a government under merkel 's leadership , effectively inviting her party to dump her . but merkel was overwhelmingly re-elected as head of her parliamentary group earlier this week , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of the negotiations . merkel met earlier in the day with the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with whom she had originally hoped to form a government .
that partnership came up short of a governing majority after the general election on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.09.2005 rivals vow more talks to break deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- remains sure she 'll lead the country first coalition talks between germany 's two biggest parties broke up thursday with conservative leader angela merkel saying there were " clear differences " between her and chancellor gerhard schröder 's ruling party . " differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .

" differences of opinion between the two sides were massive , " merkel said after the discussions , which were aimed at working out how to end the debilitating political stalemate caused by sunday 's inconclusive general election . with no clear winner , germany is effectively locked in political paralysis while the two main parties race to be the first to assemble a coalition with a governing majority .
both merkel - whose christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- narrowly won the election but without the majority they had been seeking - and schröder insist they have a mandate to rule the country . they agreed to meet again next wednesday.thursday 's one-hour discussions set the tone . " i made it clear that i , together with the christian democrats , have a mandate to form a government , " merkel said . " we made it clear we want to govern with schroeder as chancellor , " retorted social democrats ' leader franz muentefering . schröder , for his part , said : " we want a stable government and the parties have the responsibility to put in place such a government for the whole of the legislative period and i am sure that that will be the case . "
desperate search for solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has n't lost his good mood as yet with neither the christian democrats nor social democrats able to achieve a majority with their respective preferred coalition partners , the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- for the cdu and the greens for the spd , each party is searching for other solutions . most observers believe the final outcome will be a so-called grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats . a poll released on thursday by the emnid institute showed 47 percent of germans would like to see merkel lead a grand coalition , against 44 percent for schröder .
before her talks with schröder 's party , merkel had held early discussions with the free democrats . bidding to keep alive her ambition of becoming the country 's first woman leader , merkel said afterwards that the christian democrats would not accept the formation of a minority government .
" i do not believe a minority government is fitting for a country as important as germany , " she said .
separately , merkel said that she saw difficulties in any coalition between the christian democrats and greens , whom she will meet for talks on friday . one proposal has been for the christian democrats to join with the fdp and the greens in a coalition dubbed " jamaica " because the parties ' black , yellow and green colors would match the caribbean nation 's flag .
despite result , merkel confirmed as leader just a week ago , merkel , the 51-year-old trained physicist from the former east germany , had been tipped to secure a ruling majority .
but merkel saw the 20-point lead her party had enjoyed early in the campaign eroded to under one percent by schröder 's party on election day .
she was overwhelmingly re-elected as the head of her party 's parliamentary group on tuesday , giving her a much-needed vote of confidence ahead of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers reported on thursday that schröder 's party had raised the idea of changing the rules of parliament in order to give it a numerical advantage in seats .
one suggestion - denied by the spd - would be to divide the conservative parliamentary bloc into its two constituents , the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
each party would then have fewer seats than the social democrats , allowing schröder to claim his group was the biggest in the bundestag lower house . csu leader edmund stoiber , who was also taking part in the negotiations on thursday , hit out at this plan , saying schröder 's party must " accept that he has not won the election and that he has lost it .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .
in the netherlands , the social democrats and neo-liberal party governed for 20 years until 2002 . germany 's political leadership would be well-served to follow the lead of other countries , say the election experts .
" by committing themselves to just one coalition partner , the major parties have unnecessarily limited their possibilities , " said niedermayer . angela göpfert -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany leans left although the conservative cdu / csu got the most votes of a single party , most germans cast their ballots for center-left and left-wing parties .

and in their efforts to look for coalition partners , they 'd be well served to look for inspiration abroad , say experts . it seems that the guiding principle of the german voter might just be " small is beautiful . "
the dismal showing of the two major parties , the social democrats and conservative christian democratic union , in sunday 's election was offset by the impressive gains made by smaller parties , like the left party and the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the cdu alone lost an estimated 1.1 million voters to the free democrats , many of whom gave their vote to the fdp in order to ensure a coalition between the cdu and fdp . observers in other countries are already beginning to talk of a europe-wide trend spelling the end of the continent 's major parties .
the liberal swedish daily newspaper dagens nyheter attributes the gains of the smaller parties to the " luxury " of the choice given voters in major european countries .
things are going relatively well on the continent , allowing voters to pick and choose which party gives them the most and takes away the least . german election experts attribute the success of the left party , which promised voters a light version of economic reform , to this phenomenon . big parties failed to convince but not all are willing to see a trend .
oskar niedermayer , a professor of political science at free university in berlin , said that the cdu and spd 's poor performance " does not call for any doomsday scenarios . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greens , fdp -lrb- yellow -rrb- , and left party -lrb- violet -rrb- , have made life complicated for germany 's big two niedermayer sees the major parties ' poor performance in sunday 's election as a germany-specific situation .
" both major parties failed to convince the voters that the social market economy can no longer be supported , " he said . the sooner the two parties begin articulating their plans for reform and do so in a way that emphasizes the necessity for change , the sooner they 'll bounce back , said niedermayer . no longer a class-struggle this year 's election proved to be a reincarnation of a decades-old german political battle .
but what was once called " class struggle " is now a battle over the future of the social market economy .
back then it was the difference between labor and capital , today , it 's the dispute over neo-liberal economic solutions to reforming the economic system . the change in context has led german voters to throw their support behind smaller parties , argues martin morlok , director of the institute for german and european party research .
" they 'll vote for a smaller party , that has specialized in a certain area and represents a more extreme position than a larger party with a grab bag of offers , " said morlok . " the left party , compared to the spd , can take an extreme position on the topic of social justice , " in the economic reform plans , added niedermayer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder failed to convince voters they alone had the answer to germany 's problems the lesson from belgium and holland germany 's political establishment has also proven itself to be the exception when it comes to it willingness to overcome traditional positions in forming coalitions .
the fdp 's current refusal to even consider a coalition with the social democrats is evidence of such , experts say , dated behavior . " in other european countries , they are much more relaxed , and less squeamish , " said morlok .
belgium 's prime minister guy verhofstadt , whose party is similar to germany 's fdp , led a coalition with the social democrats and greens until his re-election in 2003 .
since , he 's led a coalition with just the social democrats .
in the netherlands , the social democrats and neo-liberal party governed for 20 years until 2002 . germany 's political leadership would be well-served to follow the lead of other countries , say the election experts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.09.2005 sisterhoods make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the community reaches out to single mothers and older women for centuries , beguine communities devoted themselves to a life of prayer and charitable work .
germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .

germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .
in the eastern german state of thuringia , beguines operate an ecological farm with a guesthouse .
in the southern german university town of tübingen , beguines support single mothers .
and in cologne and rostock , they focus on cultural activities and promoting women . cornelia schäfer -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

though biodiesel fuel enjoys a good reputation in germany , it ca n't be used in all diesel motors . biodiesel seems like the ideal way to unify two german passions : fast food and getting the most mileage out of their fuel money . the possibility of turning deep-fryer oil left over from schnitzels and french fries into a fuel to help cars race down the autobahn as a replacement for conventional , carbon-based diesel has many in germany excited . even though biodiesel 's price follows diesel 's highs and lows , it generally sells at between 10 and 15 euro cents per liter -lrb- $ 0.12 and $ 0.18 per quarter gallon -rrb- less than regular diesel and as it is currently exempt from germany 's petroleum tax , the organic fuel is becoming especially attractive .

" using biodiesel in cars that have not been approved can invalidate the car 's warranty . " ironically , it 's newer , more efficient cars that are least likely to be approved for biodiesel use .
rust particle filters , which come equipped in many new diesel automobiles , do not tolerate biodiesel , and the fuel also does not meet updated european emissions standards to curb air pollution , which come into effect in january 2006 . while reducing carbon dioxide , burning biodiesel emits more nitrous oxide than allowed by the looming eu regulations .
for these reasons , " few new diesel cars are receiving approval to use biodiesel , " andrea gärtner , a technician for germany 's largest auto club , told the dpa news agency . consumers have two options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen 's golf 5 can be converted to run on biodiesel there are ecological advantages and disadvantages to using biological fuels , according to guido reinhardt of the institute for energy and environmental research in heidelberg . " the advantages of the currently used biofuels will probably increase as compared to conventional fuels , " he wrote in a 2004 study before concluding that there is still much more research to be done . until additional answers on the climate effect of biodiesel are found , drivers are left with two options , according to retzlaff . " consumers looking to do something good for the environment , and for their wallets , have to buy a car that 's been approved or settle for filling up with the diesel-biodiesel mixes , " she said . biological blends already in tanks biodiesel blends have been permitted at german gas stations without special labeling requirements since january 2004 .
the automobile industry has agreed biodiesel can account for up to five percent of " regular " diesel without adversely affecting performance .
pure biodiesel , called b100 , is available at about 12 percent of germany 's 15,000 gas stations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed oil accounts for what goes into german biodiesel though it is possible to convert fatty oils and household garbage , with the exception of metal and ceramic , the products of these processes tends to clog fuel filters .
to avoid some of these problems , german biodiesel is made exclusively by processing rapeseed oil with methane gas . the organic fuel it produces is important in helping germany reach european union goal of using biological fuels to cover two percent of energy needs by 2005 and 5.75 percent by 2010 .
biodiesel currently makes up four percent of germany 's total diesel sales . even taking into account that fewer passenger cars will be able to fill up with biodiesel , retzlaff said germany " using its own sources of raw materials , would be able to meet the eu goals .

" also because the companies can go directly to the provider , they can get a price that 's better than paying at the pump . " germany in good position thanks in part to increased commercial use , retzlaff said she expects the market for biodiesel to continue growing and that german companies , which were among the initial adopters of commercial biodiesel in the early 1990s , are in a good position to take advantage of the growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.09.2005 sisterhoods make a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the community reaches out to single mothers and older women for centuries , beguine communities devoted themselves to a life of prayer and charitable work .
germany has seen a renaissance in these lay sisterhoods in recent years .
most are adapting traditions to meet modern needs . beguines were founded in the netherlands in the middle ages , spreading to france and germany up until the beginning of the 20th century .
groups of women founded these lay sisterhoods , which followed an austere life without the religious vows of a nun . today , there are some 25 beguine communities in germany , like in the western german town of schwerte .
this beguine group defines itself as strongly secular .
co-founder lore seifert said they want to help women today find a suitable way to deal with their lives . this was also the case in the middle ages .
at that time , women had a worse position in families , especially if they were unmarried . " they did n't want to enter a convent , perhaps because they did n't want to live by those rules , " said seifert .
" these women discovered the beguine way of life , which was independent and they could fend for themselves .
they could determine what had to be done in their lives . " an old solution to modern-day problems over the centuries , beguines were usually unmarried women or widows .
they lived in convent-like housing communities , known as béguinages , and followed a tradition of doing predominantly charitable work . this is often still the case today , although these communities have become more of a response to women 's modern-day situation . " there are a lot of women living alone , women getting older and single mothers , " said seifert .
" we 're trying to find an overall living form to bring these women together . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the béguinage in schwerte was designed by the women living there thirteen women with five children live in the schwerte community , an ecologically designed building .
single mother corinna wunderling , 43 , is one of them .
she said she has already learned " endlessly " from the collective experiences and knowledge of the older women in the community . " i hope that my son and i myself learn a lot about other concepts of living by being here , " said wunderling .
" the isolation disappears and we 're no longer just focused on each other . " kindred spirits who help others every woman in the beguine community has a good reason for being there .
some have lost their partners ; others were simply tired of battling for time with their friends who had families of their own .
beguines want to be with kindred spirits , who support each other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beguines are very active in taking care of the elderly but beguines also look out for more than just their own welfare .
they take on responsibilities outside of their communities , for example by working in hospices , helping migrant children with their homework or taking care of women who have been victims of violence . in schwerte , the beguines live in an environmentally-friendly manner .
they show their solidarity with the developing world by buying fair trade products .
but they have also sought contact to their neighborhood to find out what benefits it hopes to gain from the beguine project .
there have been requests for child care and some women already look after older people or those in need of care . although the schwerte group considers itself secular , beguine irmtraud ruder-schnelle said she and her sisterhood do live a life of piety . " the way we live , sustainable and environmentally conscious , is something very significant , " said ruder-schnelle .
" or the way we deal with each other : i think it is a form of spirituality . " christian charity especially for women the beguine community for the western german cities of essen and werne is the most closely tied to its historic model .
these women , who do not live in a béguinage , meet on a regular basis to pray . " we 're dreaming about a spiritual center for beguines in germany , which already exist in switzerland and austria , " said brita lieb , who co-ordinates the group .
the 60-year-old , who is actually protestant , found her spiritual life in the catholic church following her divorce and several years as a single mother .
she calls herself a secular sister in the congregation of holy hearts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this béguinage in amsterdam is one of the oldest in europe " we have found a true form of women 's solidarity and we wo n't allow ourselves to be divided , " said lieb . 80-year-old gertrud hofmann co-founded this group 20 years ago - as a makeshift solution .
no religious order would consecrate the 60-year-old widow at that time .
but the more hofmann dealt with the beguine tradition , the more excited she was about it . " with us religious beguines , there are all forms of christian charity , with a focus on women , " said hofmann .
" there 's a group that visits people who have no one else .
there 's another group that takes of care of elder sick persons .
there are countless examples of our work . " in the middle ages , the sick and needy were considered punished by god .
according to hofmann , beguines molded social history by taking care of these groups . " the beguines were the first to really take care of the ill , who made sure they had clean bedding and treated them like christ himself , " said hofmann .
" this changed nursing traditions and the way the sick were viewed . " a diverse community of women in the over 700 years of their existence , beguines have taken on a variety of activities and ways of life .
their commitment to this gave them a certain independence refused other women . payment for their handicrafts , nursing , hospice work , teaching and prayer made them economically independent .
they were in part highly regarded in society as chaste and spiritual women .
at the same time , they had the freedom to leave the beguine community without any damage if they decided to marry . today , many beguine communities are made up of predominantly protestant women , who critically deal with religious dogmas and beliefs from a feminist perspective . their activities are as diverse as their members .

the road to the chancellery stop and go in traffic light coalition current affairs -pipe- 22.09.2005 cdu , spd closer than they think großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not close , but their parties might be no one wanted it - now it might be the only option .
but should germany 's conservatives and social democrats form a grand coalition , they might find more similarities than differences . before this week , a grand coalition between the social democrats and the conservative christian social union and christian democratic union was routinely rejected by bigwigs from all three parties .
but after german voters proved too skittish to give either one of the country 's major parties a majority to carry forth reforming the economy , many experts consider the grand coalition the only viable solution . the big question whether angela merkel or gerhard schröder will lead it is the most debated issue in germany at the moment .
whoever takes over might find that a coalition of germany 's biggest parties might not be the thing of horror most economic experts think it is . labor market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union parties want the companies and unions to negotiate with one another one of the key differences is job-protection measures that forbid companies larger than 10 employees from hiring and firing workers with ease .
the union parties want to lower the bar slightly , so that companies smaller than 20 employees would have the freedom to hire and fire for the first two years after they hire someone without meeting fierce resistance from germany 's still-powerful unions .
if elected , the conservatives also want to allow wage contracts outside of the industry-wide negotiated standard if worker councils and two thirds of employees agree with their employers to such a deal .
the spd , though no longer the trade union party it once was , would still have a tough time agreeing to such a step .
the spd is more flexible on corrections to the hartz iv labor market reforms introduced as part of schröder 's reform program .
experts see the two parties close on issues such as further improvement of the still-ineffective federal employment agency , and the tweaking of job creation measures that the union considers ineffective .
but the nationwide minimum wage , something the spd has begun to advocate , might also be a source of heated discussion . health care the spd wants every health insurance company , regardless of whether it 's private or state-run , to insure citizens , regardless of risk . the union parties plan a similar nationwide program , also based on solidarity , but unlike the spd model , do n't vary its insurance fees based on a person 's income .
the union parties would freeze the rate that an employer pays into germany 's public health funds , part of their overall goal of reducing extra wage costs .
because both proposals would involve more bureaucracy - which none truly want - experts think that both parties might be willing to abandon their plans for a compromise idea .
such a compromise might be the union 's call for a freeze on the amount of money an employer contributes . nursing care insurance and pension reform are also areas on which experts believe both parties can work towards a compromise . budget policy none of the parties seem particularly motivated to implement cost-cutting measures - like the free-market liberal free democratic party would like to see it .
grand coalitions tend to solve their differences by spending more money , not cutting costs , anyway .
the union parties would like to see tax loopholes closed to fill state coffers severely strained by high public spending .
in addition , merkel has promised to raise the sales tax from 16 to 18 percent in order to lower non-wage labor costs , and cut taxes for both lower income and higher income earners .
the plans run against promises made by the spd not to raise the vat , or consumption , tax .
but their party program does n't outright reject the notion , hence opening the way to possible compromise . the two parties agree that both publicly and privately held firms should be taxed at the same rate . energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is loath to cut coal subsidies : coal workers are some of their most steady voters after working with the green party to introduce a phase-out of nuclear energy in germany , the spd could be persuaded to delay the process slightly in order to keep up with energy demands - something the cdu would like .
it 'll be more difficult with the spd 's dogged commitment to subsidizing german coal power .
the spd 's traditional voters are in germany 's coal and rust belt , in the west of the country , and eliminating the subsidies - as the union parties demand - could provoke an identity crisis . both parties will have a tough time compromising on a clear , thought-out energy policy - but other coalition constellations likely would n't do much better . foreign and domestic security in the age of islamic terrorism , spd interior minister otto schily has proved to be far more hard-line than anyone had expected .
his conservative anti-terrorism measures have been largely greeted by union security experts , who would n't get the chance to do things much differently in a grand coalition - with civil rights parties like the greens and fdp checking them in the opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer relations between washington and berlin should merkel come to power turkey is the only major foreign policy question separating them .
schröder has advocated heavily for full membership of the largely muslim nation in the european union .
merkel has offered a " privileged partnership " which would keep turkey at arm 's length . the relationship to the united states would largely depend on which person was chancellor : schröder would maintain his cool cordiality towards washington , merkel would work to improve the tone of transatlantic relations , and would be far more welcome in the white house . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what german business wants post-election business and the economics institutes agree that the german economy is in need of a major overhaul .
but which of the governing coalitions now possible most conforms to their reform visions is a more difficult question .
-lrb- sept .
22 , 2005 -rrb- where german politicans fear to tread historically speaking , germany has tended to consider federal level grand coalitions to be a clumsy last resort option .
thus far , the country has only had one and it lasted just three years .

but mr jaafari moved to quell disagreements by saying the incident was still being investigated .
the iraqi prime minister said there was still a " desperate need " for coalition troops while the iraqis built their own security forces .
but he added he was " optimistic " that iraqi forces were making progress and shortening the amount of time foreign soldiers would be needed .

bayaman erkinbayev was shot in the neck and chest as he arrived by car at his home in the capital , bishkek .
mr erkinbayev , 38 , was a wealthy businessman in southern kyrgyzstan , where the anti-akayev protests began .
he is the second parliamentary deputy to be killed since the popular uprising earlier this year .
the country has seen continuing political instability since then .
recent troubles 22 september : politician and businessman bayaman erkinbayev shot dead 13 june : security guards open fire on protesters in osh , injuring at least seven 10 june : politician jyrgalbek surabaldiyev shot dead in bishkek 1 june : hundreds eject protesters from supreme court which they had held for more than a month according to a bbc correspondent in the region , mr erkinbayev was a former wrestler who owned a number of shops and hotels around the southern town of osh .
he was widely rumoured to be associated with the criminal world , our correspondent says .
in recent months , mr erkinbayev had been involved in a murky and sometimes violent dispute over control of a lucrative regional market , one of the largest in the unstable ferghana valley region around osh .
in april , he escaped what he termed an attempt on his life , when he was shot and wounded in the face in bishkek .
it is unclear whether the motivation for that attack was political - at the time , he had announced plans to run for president - or linked to his business interests .
in june , security guards in osh opened fire on hundreds of protesters demonstrating against mr erkinbayev , whom they said has a heavy influence on small businesses in the region .
it was the biggest public protest since mr akayev was driven into exile .
kurmanbek bakiev was elected president in july .

mars , the roman god of war , used to guard the entrance of chirk castle but disappeared sometime after 1911 .
he stood with counterpart , hercules , for 50 years until they were separated .
hercules was found in a nearby wood in 1983 and brought back to the castle by helicopter .
experts have now renewed the hunt for the 12ft tall mars . "
mars was taken and put on a plinth in what became known as , and still is , mars wood " emma hegarty , chirk castle historian nigel davies said : " when you think of the sheer size of it and the weight , and that it has gone for a walk without anyone noticing .
but this is within living memory so someone may know something . "
mr davies said it was possible the statue of the god of war was used to help in another confrontation - as scrap metal in world war i or ii .
" but then why take one -lrb- statue -rrb- and not the other ?
if by some miracle it was found , it would be absolutely fantastic . "
the appeal to the public is being made as part of chirk 's castle at war events .
visitors to the national trust property will be told the statues were first erected almost 300 years ago .
mars and hercules were copies of classical statues from greece and rome .
they were removed in 1770 after standing next to each for half a century .
statues separated the steward at the time recorded : " hercules and mars driven out of their court and turned back to back ... they have been very near neighbours to each other upwards of 50 years , and have not in all that time had an angry word with one another , a rare instance of friendship indeed . "
hercules , which was found in 1983 , can be seen in the lime avenue to the east of the castle .
chirk castle property manager emma hegarty said : " mars was taken a reasonable distance from the castle and put on a plinth in what became known as , and still is , mars wood . "
mrs hegarty said mars was still there in 1911 but there was no other record of him until 1960 , where it is stated , he was missing .
the only remnants which exist of mars are the original 1770 plinth and a rubbing of an engraving .

the firm , which employs 86 , said it was part of a commitment to improve staff health as well as the environment .
three workers have so far switched from cars to bikes and are re-paying the loan at £ 5 per week .
the company also provides showers for workers who cycle to work , in addition to advice about the safest routes .

" it keeps me fit and i beat the traffic jams on the way into aberystwyth in the morning , " he said .
" i used to play football and rugby , but my knees suffered and i had to stop .
but cycling does n't seem to effect my knees .

the numbers of stone curlews had declined dramatically since the end of world war ii largely because of modern farming techniques .
but an alliance of farmers and landowners has managed to save the bird from possible extinction .
the two main populations are around salisbury plain and in the brecklands on the norfolk-suffolk border .
new target numbers had fallen to around 160 breeding pairs in 1985 but have now reached 103 pairs , mostly on salisbury plain and porton down , and 187 in the brecks .
smaller populations exist in north norfolk and east suffolk , taking the total to more than 300 .
this is ahead of a government-backed biodiversity action plan , set in 1995 , which included a population target of 300 pairs by 2010 .
robin wynde , royal society for the protection of birds biodiversity policy officer , said : " there is no doubt that without conservation work the stone curlew may no longer have been a uk breeding bird by now .
" it has come back from the brink . "
" there is no doubt that without conservation work the stone curlew may no longer have been a uk breeding bird by now " robin wynde , rspb the stone curlew is about the length of a crow but slimmer and its most striking characteristics are its long yellow legs and powerful large yellow eyes .
mr wynde added that a new target will be adopted next year .
he said : " now we want to help the bird recolonise some of its former sites which used to include parts of cambridgeshire , the chilterns and sussex 's south downs . "

according to its survey , broadband take-up has grown by just 3 % in the last year .
of the 67 % of americans online , 53 % of them are now online via a broadband connection .
the remaining half are going to be harder to convert thinks report author john horrigan .
" there are fewer people hankering for high speed now and that means less pent-up demand for broadband , " he said .
no plateau the dial-up users of 2005 tended to be older , less educated and with lower incomes than their 2002 counterparts .
while dial-up surfers in 2002 were heavier users of the internet and therefore willing converts to broadband , there is less enthusiasm among those currently in the net slow lane to make the switch , said the report .
coupled with the fact that fewer new internet users are coming online " the stock of potential broadband subscribers is not being replenished , " the report found .
mr horrigan did not think broadband access had entirely plateaued in the us but he did believe it would take several years to get the next 10 % of broadband users online .
around 15 % of those in rural america have no access getting access to broadband technology is still an issue for some in the us , particularly those living in rural areas .
social effects as many as 15 % of the population could be cut off from high-speed access , although official statistics are hard to come by .
this is because broadband providers are only required by the federal government to submit the postal district that they cover , rather than go into specific details of how many people in a particular area can get the technology .
the slow-down in broadband take-up is likely to have knock-on social effects , said mr horrigan .
e-government and healthcare information is increasingly being put online , leaving those without any net access at a distinct disadvantage .
" details of how to get a subscription drug benefit available to senior citizens was recently put online but only 27 % of over-65 's have net access , meaning people were lacking information about a key benefit , " said mr horrigan .
net providers in the us have been offering cut-price broadband in an attempt to gain new converts but mr horrigan is not sure the strategy is working for those who simply do not see the benefits of having high-speed net connections .
