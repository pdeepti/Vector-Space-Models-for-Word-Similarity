cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?
then it would be as if nothing had ever happened , " he said .
" this way , there 's at least a chance to say : ' look at this .
that 's the way it was .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe often baffled at schiavo furor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiavo case touched a religious nerve in the us the case of terri schiavo has been closely followed by europeans .
there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .
" in the netherlands , the doctors are making these decisions .
the feeding tube and the hydration are considered medical treatments and if they are determined to be futile , they can be stopped . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium followed holland in passing a law legalizing euthanasia in 2002 and ten other countries in europe allow some kind of " passive " euthanasia . in france , the practice remains illegal , although the case of vincent humbert , a man who was left blind , paralyzed and mute after an auto accident in 2000 , moved lawmakers to draft a draft " right-to-die " law that has passed the national assembly and will be debated by the senate later this year . according to dr. jean cohen , chairman of france 's association for the right to die with dignity , there are large parallels between the schiavo case and that of humbert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " most here have compassion for the patient , and are in favour of allowing death because they understand there is no point living in this state , " he told time magazine .
although there was a big difference : humbert asked to die after he was incapacitated , terri schiavo could not . condemnation but not everyone in europe sees euthanasia as a matter that should be removed from the moral sphere .
after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the circumstances of the death of mrs. terri schiavo have rightly shocked consciences .
a life has been interrupted , " said chief spokesman joaquin navarro-valls in a statement in the vatican 's first comment on schiavo 's death .
the vatican newspaper had repeatedly called the courts involved in the decisions " executioners . " " a death was arbitrarily brought forward … there can be no exceptions to the principle of the sacred nature of life from the moment of conception until its natural end . " the statement added that the holy see hoped that case would lead to legal changes . italy 's minister for european affairs , rocco buttiglione , who enraged many with his controversial comments on homosexuality and the role of women , has greeted american politicians ' involvement in the schiavo case . " it will strengthen the position of those opposing euthanasia in europe and start a debate here , " he said . not possible in germany the schiavo case could not happen in germany , however , largely because the country 's experience with state-sanctioned euthanasia of the mentally ill and others during the nazi era . " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said dr. jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of the german medical association .
" if it could be proved that -lsb- schiavo -rsb- had expressed a wish that treatment should be stopped , that would be a different matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?
then it would be as if nothing had ever happened , " he said .

some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .

claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?
then it would be as if nothing had ever happened , " he said .

meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .
unicef wants to scale up this kind of strategy , because repressive laws alone wo n't work .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions .

there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .

after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the circumstances of the death of mrs. terri schiavo have rightly shocked consciences .

some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .

it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .

“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .

the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .

some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

" the biological parameters are notably compromised , " it said , adding the " holy father - with visible participation - is joining in the continual prayers of those assisting him . " the statement was delivered as thousands of people attended a special mass in rome 's saint john in lateran cathedral . aross the world , from his native poland to indonesia via the middle east , thousands of faithful also prayed for the pontiff who has led the world 's 1.1 billion catholics for more than a quarter of a century .
hours earlier , the vatican had said the pope 's condition was " very serious " following a heart attack , septic shock and a urinary tract infection , and although by midday he was reported to be stable , a senior cardinal said he was " abandoned to the will of god . "
navarro-valls , who has been the spokesman for john paul ii since late 1984 , was visibly moved when asked for his personal feelings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe failing trafficked children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims of child trafficking are often left with nowhere to turn countries in south-east europe are failing to take successful measures against people trafficking , says a unicef report .
meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking .

" i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .

but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 school takes on neo-nazi dress code großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : provocative symbols will be banned if the school gets its way a school in southern germany is trying to ban students from wearing neo-nazi gear even though instituting a formal dress code leads them into a legal grey area . students sport bomber jackets with a not-so-secret code for " heil hitler " stitched on .
or they strut in combat boots with white laces , a symbol for the white race .
or maybe , some go so far as to decorate school walls with nazi symbols . in one school in the southern german town of weinstadt in baden-württemberg , school officials say that since the beginning of the school year , this phenomenon has become increasingly common . " every tenth student regularly wears the right-wing extremist symbols , " teacher antje fröhlich of the reinhold-nägele high school told der spiegel newsmagazine . one teacher found a swastica on classroom walls . but when a ninth grader showed up sporting a jacket with " european master race " on it , school staff had been pushed too far : the teacher refused to allow the child into the classroom . shortly after , the teacher called the student 's father , who did n't acknowledge there was a problem , saying that as long as there is no official rule forbidding such apparel , he would do nothing .
besides , he told the teacher , his son has no interest in politics but just wear such gear because he likes it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not in our school , teachers say learning a new language for most adults , this sort of secret language is incomprehensible .
it consists of such things as " 88 , " code for " heil hitler " -lrb- h is the 8th letter of the alphabet -rrb- or 18 , a symbol for adolf hitler , or particular brands of clothing that neo-nazis prefer such as lonsdale of london . but these days , parents and officials are learning fast .
at another school , students , parents and school staff decided by a majority to forbid these symbols .
and at reinhold nägele high school , staff is pleading with state officials to create a law so they can do the same . but so far , it has n't been a smooth road .
questions have arisen over freedom of expression .
school officials grapple to determine which gear to forbid : should they ban combat boots completely or only when they are worn with a bomber jacket ?
or should the school examine each case individually ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poor example for children no ban other german states , such as berlin and lower saxony , have for years forbidden such symbols in schools , affecting about 40,000 students .
but vbe teachers ' union has warned that such actions threaten personal freedoms and are ineffective . " many teachers are n't familiar with many regulations , " spokesman for the union , vbe spokesman michael gomolzig told der spiegel . he recommended educating children about the radical right in elementary school because " by the time they are sporting bomber jackets and combat boots , it is too late . " officials from baden-württemberg have decided against a state-wide ban , saying that it is not a school 's place to decide what students can wear .
still , they are allowing schools to forbid specific gear symbolic of the right-wing extremists , because they say this does n't hurt personal freedoms . meanwhile , teachers from the school hope for an open discussion between parents , students and staff so that the school , said one teacher , could be salvaged . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un urges germany to rein in neo-nazism a new report submitted to the united nations human rights commission on monday called on the eu and other member states to ban racist political parties and crack down on neo-nazism , especially in eastern germany .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe failing trafficked children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims of child trafficking are often left with nowhere to turn countries in south-east europe are failing to take successful measures against people trafficking , says a unicef report .
meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .
unicef wants to scale up this kind of strategy , because repressive laws alone wo n't work .
education and awareness raising are the most likely ways of prevent trafficking in the long term . imogen foulkes -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts criticize eu over human trafficking eu justice commissioner franco frattini announced wednesday the bloc would intensify efforts to stop human trafficking .

meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .

instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe often baffled at schiavo furor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiavo case touched a religious nerve in the us the case of terri schiavo has been closely followed by europeans .
there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .
" in the netherlands , the doctors are making these decisions .
the feeding tube and the hydration are considered medical treatments and if they are determined to be futile , they can be stopped . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium followed holland in passing a law legalizing euthanasia in 2002 and ten other countries in europe allow some kind of " passive " euthanasia . in france , the practice remains illegal , although the case of vincent humbert , a man who was left blind , paralyzed and mute after an auto accident in 2000 , moved lawmakers to draft a draft " right-to-die " law that has passed the national assembly and will be debated by the senate later this year . according to dr. jean cohen , chairman of france 's association for the right to die with dignity , there are large parallels between the schiavo case and that of humbert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " most here have compassion for the patient , and are in favour of allowing death because they understand there is no point living in this state , " he told time magazine .
although there was a big difference : humbert asked to die after he was incapacitated , terri schiavo could not . condemnation but not everyone in europe sees euthanasia as a matter that should be removed from the moral sphere .
after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the circumstances of the death of mrs. terri schiavo have rightly shocked consciences .
a life has been interrupted , " said chief spokesman joaquin navarro-valls in a statement in the vatican 's first comment on schiavo 's death .
the vatican newspaper had repeatedly called the courts involved in the decisions " executioners . " " a death was arbitrarily brought forward … there can be no exceptions to the principle of the sacred nature of life from the moment of conception until its natural end . " the statement added that the holy see hoped that case would lead to legal changes . italy 's minister for european affairs , rocco buttiglione , who enraged many with his controversial comments on homosexuality and the role of women , has greeted american politicians ' involvement in the schiavo case . " it will strengthen the position of those opposing euthanasia in europe and start a debate here , " he said . not possible in germany the schiavo case could not happen in germany , however , largely because the country 's experience with state-sanctioned euthanasia of the mentally ill and others during the nazi era . " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said dr. jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of the german medical association .
" if it could be proved that -lsb- schiavo -rsb- had expressed a wish that treatment should be stopped , that would be a different matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .

" for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions .

" this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .

" while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough .

" i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe often baffled at schiavo furor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiavo case touched a religious nerve in the us the case of terri schiavo has been closely followed by europeans .
there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .
" in the netherlands , the doctors are making these decisions .
the feeding tube and the hydration are considered medical treatments and if they are determined to be futile , they can be stopped . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium followed holland in passing a law legalizing euthanasia in 2002 and ten other countries in europe allow some kind of " passive " euthanasia . in france , the practice remains illegal , although the case of vincent humbert , a man who was left blind , paralyzed and mute after an auto accident in 2000 , moved lawmakers to draft a draft " right-to-die " law that has passed the national assembly and will be debated by the senate later this year . according to dr. jean cohen , chairman of france 's association for the right to die with dignity , there are large parallels between the schiavo case and that of humbert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " most here have compassion for the patient , and are in favour of allowing death because they understand there is no point living in this state , " he told time magazine .
although there was a big difference : humbert asked to die after he was incapacitated , terri schiavo could not . condemnation but not everyone in europe sees euthanasia as a matter that should be removed from the moral sphere .
after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the circumstances of the death of mrs. terri schiavo have rightly shocked consciences .
a life has been interrupted , " said chief spokesman joaquin navarro-valls in a statement in the vatican 's first comment on schiavo 's death .

membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .

last year , lufthansa returned to profit , and with swiss under its wing , is firmly on expansion course . lufthansa marks not its birthday on april 1 , but rather its rebirth .
the company 's history actually dates back to 1926 , when the airline was founded in berlin .
following the end of world war ii , the company was completely liquidated by the allies . but 10 years later with the special permission of the allies , the newly founded deutsche lufthansa ag took to the skies again , with 17 passengers on board a convair 340 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lufthansa crane the one thing that has remained the same over lufthansa 's entire history is the symbol of the crane in flight in the corporate colors of blue and yellow - but that 's about the only thing . keeping fit today , with around 90,000 employees and more than 50 million passengers in the last year alone , lufthansa is one of the world 's largest airlines .
the carrier continues to be on expansion course , having just announced its takeover of swiss international air lines in a deal worth up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 409 million -rrb- . on its 50th year in operation , lufthansa could well be expected to show its age , perhaps even carry a bit of excess weight ?
not so , according to lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , who refers to a " fitness program " that keeps the company lean and efficient . the only downer at friday 's party is the airline 's catering subsidiary , lsg sky chefs .
lufthansa 's core passenger business recovered from the crisis it suffered following the sept .

but the passenger business is still the company 's core - one that has benefited tremendously from formation of the star alliance network of carriers . corporate headquarters are still in cologne , even though the majority of pilots , flight attendants and ground staff are based at frankfurt airport - germany 's international hub . " we 're very grateful that lufthansa and the very successful star alliance are here .
the success of frankfurt airport is to a large extent due to lufthansa 's entrepreneurial vision , " said wilhelm bender , head of fraport . lots to offer vips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gourmet food awaits passengers using lufthansa 's new first-class terminal in recent months , lufthansa has been expanding its first-class services with improved seating , limousine service to and from the aircraft , and a new first-class terminal at frankfurt airport which one company spokesperson said was more " luxury hotel than airport lounge .

last year , lufthansa returned to profit , and with swiss under its wing , is firmly on expansion course . lufthansa marks not its birthday on april 1 , but rather its rebirth .
the company 's history actually dates back to 1926 , when the airline was founded in berlin .
following the end of world war ii , the company was completely liquidated by the allies . but 10 years later with the special permission of the allies , the newly founded deutsche lufthansa ag took to the skies again , with 17 passengers on board a convair 340 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lufthansa crane the one thing that has remained the same over lufthansa 's entire history is the symbol of the crane in flight in the corporate colors of blue and yellow - but that 's about the only thing . keeping fit today , with around 90,000 employees and more than 50 million passengers in the last year alone , lufthansa is one of the world 's largest airlines .
the carrier continues to be on expansion course , having just announced its takeover of swiss international air lines in a deal worth up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 409 million -rrb- . on its 50th year in operation , lufthansa could well be expected to show its age , perhaps even carry a bit of excess weight ?
not so , according to lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , who refers to a " fitness program " that keeps the company lean and efficient . the only downer at friday 's party is the airline 's catering subsidiary , lsg sky chefs .
lufthansa 's core passenger business recovered from the crisis it suffered following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , thanks to mayrhuber 's strict regimen of savings .
but sky chefs had to cope with enormous losses in the us , sending thousands of staff on unpaid leave . some of lufthansa 's other subsidiaries have fared better .
it subsidiary lufthansa systems group , which went from simply being the airline 's computing department , to becoming an internationally recognized it provider in the past decade , is considering entering the stock market . " globally , we 're a leading provider in the airline and aviation business , " said the group 's managing director , peter franke .
" we have tripled not just our turnover , but also our number of employees . " diversification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa owes much of its success to the development of its business divisions : lufthansa cargo for logistics , technik for maintenance and repairs , sky chefs for catering , thomas cook for travel , and systems for it services .
but the passenger business is still the company 's core - one that has benefited tremendously from formation of the star alliance network of carriers . corporate headquarters are still in cologne , even though the majority of pilots , flight attendants and ground staff are based at frankfurt airport - germany 's international hub . " we 're very grateful that lufthansa and the very successful star alliance are here .
the success of frankfurt airport is to a large extent due to lufthansa 's entrepreneurial vision , " said wilhelm bender , head of fraport . lots to offer vips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gourmet food awaits passengers using lufthansa 's new first-class terminal in recent months , lufthansa has been expanding its first-class services with improved seating , limousine service to and from the aircraft , and a new first-class terminal at frankfurt airport which one company spokesperson said was more " luxury hotel than airport lounge .

meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .
unicef wants to scale up this kind of strategy , because repressive laws alone wo n't work .

meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children .

there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .

after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life .

but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions .

" this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .

" i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?
then it would be as if nothing had ever happened , " he said .
" this way , there 's at least a chance to say : ' look at this .

that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .

recently unearthed documents from the ex-east german secret police , the stasi , appear to pin the 1981 assassination attempt on pope john paul ii on the kgb .
italy and bulgaria have pledged to investigate the claim . new documents found in the files of the former east german intelligence services confirm the 1981 assassination attempt against pope john paul ii was ordered by the soviet kgb and assigned to bulgarian and east german agents . according to italian newspaper corriere della sera , the documents found by the german government indicated that the kgb ordered bulgarian colleagues to carry out the killing , leaving the east german service known as the stasi to coordinate the operation and cover up the traces afterwards . bulgaria then handed the execution of the plot to turkish extremists , including mehmet ali agca , who pulled the trigger . ali agca , who is now in jail in turkey , claimed after his arrest that the operation was under the control of the bulgarian embassy in rome .
the bulgarians have always insisted they were innocent and argued that agca 's story was part of an anti-communist plot by the italian secret service and the cia . bulgaria and italy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secrets to be unraveled the documents consist mostly of letters from stasi operatives to their bulgarian counterparts seeking help in covering up traces after the attack and denying bulgarian involvement . so far , bulgaria has declared its readiness to give italy all the information it possesses about the alleged involvement of its then communist secret services in the assassination attempt on pope john paul ii , an italian deputy told bulgarian btv television thursday . paolo gozzanti , head of the parliamentary commission inquiring into the activities of the soviet kgb in italy during the cold war , said the bulgarian ambassador in rome had promised to help him obtain relevant documents that the former stasi sent to bulgaria in 2002 . " we agreed to launch an immediate procedure for getting the documents as soon as possible , " he said . bulgarian government spokesperson dimitar tsonev confirmed his country 's readiness to cooperate in the investigation " as soon as we have an official demand " from italy . " however , the berlin office supervising the stasi archives said it had no evidence linking the stasi , or soviet and bulgarian secret services to the assassination attempt . and the former head of the stasi , marcus wolf , said on bulgarian national television that the documents concerned demands on the part of bulgaria for the stasi 's help to end a " campaign against bulgaria by the american cia . " wolf added that the files also had been sent to italy in 1995 . pope believed assassin was a ' patsy ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answers before pope 's death ?
three bulgarians were accused of masterminding the assassination attempt on may 13 , 1981 .
one of the three , sergey antonov , was arrested in 1982 and put on trial but acquitted for lack of evidence . metodi andreev , former head of a bulgarian parliamentary commission entitled to open the files of the communist-era secret services , confirmed that sofia had received some stasi documents in the spring of 2002 . " i do not know if they is any proof of a bulgarian involvement in the attack but we need to clear up that problem in order not to throw a shadow on contemporary bulgaria , " he said . gozzanti said it was necessary to find out the truth before the death of the pope , who has said in his own memoir , " memory and identity : conversations between millenniums , " that ali agca was a tool of outside forces .

last year , lufthansa returned to profit , and with swiss under its wing , is firmly on expansion course . lufthansa marks not its birthday on april 1 , but rather its rebirth .
the company 's history actually dates back to 1926 , when the airline was founded in berlin .
following the end of world war ii , the company was completely liquidated by the allies . but 10 years later with the special permission of the allies , the newly founded deutsche lufthansa ag took to the skies again , with 17 passengers on board a convair 340 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lufthansa crane the one thing that has remained the same over lufthansa 's entire history is the symbol of the crane in flight in the corporate colors of blue and yellow - but that 's about the only thing . keeping fit today , with around 90,000 employees and more than 50 million passengers in the last year alone , lufthansa is one of the world 's largest airlines .
the carrier continues to be on expansion course , having just announced its takeover of swiss international air lines in a deal worth up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 409 million -rrb- . on its 50th year in operation , lufthansa could well be expected to show its age , perhaps even carry a bit of excess weight ?
not so , according to lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , who refers to a " fitness program " that keeps the company lean and efficient . the only downer at friday 's party is the airline 's catering subsidiary , lsg sky chefs .
lufthansa 's core passenger business recovered from the crisis it suffered following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , thanks to mayrhuber 's strict regimen of savings .
but sky chefs had to cope with enormous losses in the us , sending thousands of staff on unpaid leave . some of lufthansa 's other subsidiaries have fared better .
it subsidiary lufthansa systems group , which went from simply being the airline 's computing department , to becoming an internationally recognized it provider in the past decade , is considering entering the stock market . " globally , we 're a leading provider in the airline and aviation business , " said the group 's managing director , peter franke .
" we have tripled not just our turnover , but also our number of employees .

but the passenger business is still the company 's core - one that has benefited tremendously from formation of the star alliance network of carriers . corporate headquarters are still in cologne , even though the majority of pilots , flight attendants and ground staff are based at frankfurt airport - germany 's international hub . " we 're very grateful that lufthansa and the very successful star alliance are here .
the success of frankfurt airport is to a large extent due to lufthansa 's entrepreneurial vision , " said wilhelm bender , head of fraport . lots to offer vips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gourmet food awaits passengers using lufthansa 's new first-class terminal in recent months , lufthansa has been expanding its first-class services with improved seating , limousine service to and from the aircraft , and a new first-class terminal at frankfurt airport which one company spokesperson said was more " luxury hotel than airport lounge .

recently unearthed documents from the ex-east german secret police , the stasi , appear to pin the 1981 assassination attempt on pope john paul ii on the kgb .
italy and bulgaria have pledged to investigate the claim . new documents found in the files of the former east german intelligence services confirm the 1981 assassination attempt against pope john paul ii was ordered by the soviet kgb and assigned to bulgarian and east german agents . according to italian newspaper corriere della sera , the documents found by the german government indicated that the kgb ordered bulgarian colleagues to carry out the killing , leaving the east german service known as the stasi to coordinate the operation and cover up the traces afterwards . bulgaria then handed the execution of the plot to turkish extremists , including mehmet ali agca , who pulled the trigger . ali agca , who is now in jail in turkey , claimed after his arrest that the operation was under the control of the bulgarian embassy in rome .
the bulgarians have always insisted they were innocent and argued that agca 's story was part of an anti-communist plot by the italian secret service and the cia . bulgaria and italy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secrets to be unraveled the documents consist mostly of letters from stasi operatives to their bulgarian counterparts seeking help in covering up traces after the attack and denying bulgarian involvement . so far , bulgaria has declared its readiness to give italy all the information it possesses about the alleged involvement of its then communist secret services in the assassination attempt on pope john paul ii , an italian deputy told bulgarian btv television thursday . paolo gozzanti , head of the parliamentary commission inquiring into the activities of the soviet kgb in italy during the cold war , said the bulgarian ambassador in rome had promised to help him obtain relevant documents that the former stasi sent to bulgaria in 2002 . " we agreed to launch an immediate procedure for getting the documents as soon as possible , " he said . bulgarian government spokesperson dimitar tsonev confirmed his country 's readiness to cooperate in the investigation " as soon as we have an official demand " from italy . " however , the berlin office supervising the stasi archives said it had no evidence linking the stasi , or soviet and bulgarian secret services to the assassination attempt . and the former head of the stasi , marcus wolf , said on bulgarian national television that the documents concerned demands on the part of bulgaria for the stasi 's help to end a " campaign against bulgaria by the american cia . " wolf added that the files also had been sent to italy in 1995 . pope believed assassin was a ' patsy ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answers before pope 's death ?
three bulgarians were accused of masterminding the assassination attempt on may 13 , 1981 .
one of the three , sergey antonov , was arrested in 1982 and put on trial but acquitted for lack of evidence . metodi andreev , former head of a bulgarian parliamentary commission entitled to open the files of the communist-era secret services , confirmed that sofia had received some stasi documents in the spring of 2002 . " i do not know if they is any proof of a bulgarian involvement in the attack but we need to clear up that problem in order not to throw a shadow on contemporary bulgaria , " he said . gozzanti said it was necessary to find out the truth before the death of the pope , who has said in his own memoir , " memory and identity : conversations between millenniums , " that ali agca was a tool of outside forces .
and in a visit to bulgaria in may 2002 , the pope said he " never believed in the so-called bulgarian connection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

last year , lufthansa returned to profit , and with swiss under its wing , is firmly on expansion course . lufthansa marks not its birthday on april 1 , but rather its rebirth .
the company 's history actually dates back to 1926 , when the airline was founded in berlin .
following the end of world war ii , the company was completely liquidated by the allies . but 10 years later with the special permission of the allies , the newly founded deutsche lufthansa ag took to the skies again , with 17 passengers on board a convair 340 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lufthansa crane the one thing that has remained the same over lufthansa 's entire history is the symbol of the crane in flight in the corporate colors of blue and yellow - but that 's about the only thing . keeping fit today , with around 90,000 employees and more than 50 million passengers in the last year alone , lufthansa is one of the world 's largest airlines .
the carrier continues to be on expansion course , having just announced its takeover of swiss international air lines in a deal worth up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 409 million -rrb- . on its 50th year in operation , lufthansa could well be expected to show its age , perhaps even carry a bit of excess weight ?
not so , according to lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , who refers to a " fitness program " that keeps the company lean and efficient . the only downer at friday 's party is the airline 's catering subsidiary , lsg sky chefs .
lufthansa 's core passenger business recovered from the crisis it suffered following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , thanks to mayrhuber 's strict regimen of savings .
but sky chefs had to cope with enormous losses in the us , sending thousands of staff on unpaid leave . some of lufthansa 's other subsidiaries have fared better .
it subsidiary lufthansa systems group , which went from simply being the airline 's computing department , to becoming an internationally recognized it provider in the past decade , is considering entering the stock market . " globally , we 're a leading provider in the airline and aviation business , " said the group 's managing director , peter franke .

but the passenger business is still the company 's core - one that has benefited tremendously from formation of the star alliance network of carriers . corporate headquarters are still in cologne , even though the majority of pilots , flight attendants and ground staff are based at frankfurt airport - germany 's international hub . " we 're very grateful that lufthansa and the very successful star alliance are here .
the success of frankfurt airport is to a large extent due to lufthansa 's entrepreneurial vision , " said wilhelm bender , head of fraport . lots to offer vips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gourmet food awaits passengers using lufthansa 's new first-class terminal in recent months , lufthansa has been expanding its first-class services with improved seating , limousine service to and from the aircraft , and a new first-class terminal at frankfurt airport which one company spokesperson said was more " luxury hotel than airport lounge .

navarro-valls , who has been the spokesman for john paul ii since late 1984 , was visibly moved when asked for his personal feelings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe failing trafficked children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims of child trafficking are often left with nowhere to turn countries in south-east europe are failing to take successful measures against people trafficking , says a unicef report .
meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .
unicef wants to scale up this kind of strategy , because repressive laws alone wo n't work .

here is the statement in full . pope john paul ii slipped towards death friday after a devastating heart attack as the vatican called on the world 's roman catholics to pray for their spiritual leader .
the vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls was somber late friday : " the general conditions and cardio-respiratory conditions of the holy father have further worsened , " navarro-valls said in a statement to reporters at the vatican . the 84-year-old pontiff was also experiencing a " gradual worsening " of his blood pressure " and breathing has become shallow , " navarro-valls said . doctors treating the pope had also noted " renal insufficiency , " according to the statement .
" the biological parameters are notably compromised , " it said , adding the " holy father - with visible participation - is joining in the continual prayers of those assisting him . " the statement was delivered as thousands of people attended a special mass in rome 's saint john in lateran cathedral . aross the world , from his native poland to indonesia via the middle east , thousands of faithful also prayed for the pontiff who has led the world 's 1.1 billion catholics for more than a quarter of a century .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?
then it would be as if nothing had ever happened , " he said .

last year , lufthansa returned to profit , and with swiss under its wing , is firmly on expansion course . lufthansa marks not its birthday on april 1 , but rather its rebirth .
the company 's history actually dates back to 1926 , when the airline was founded in berlin .
following the end of world war ii , the company was completely liquidated by the allies . but 10 years later with the special permission of the allies , the newly founded deutsche lufthansa ag took to the skies again , with 17 passengers on board a convair 340 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lufthansa crane the one thing that has remained the same over lufthansa 's entire history is the symbol of the crane in flight in the corporate colors of blue and yellow - but that 's about the only thing . keeping fit today , with around 90,000 employees and more than 50 million passengers in the last year alone , lufthansa is one of the world 's largest airlines .
the carrier continues to be on expansion course , having just announced its takeover of swiss international air lines in a deal worth up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 409 million -rrb- . on its 50th year in operation , lufthansa could well be expected to show its age , perhaps even carry a bit of excess weight ?
not so , according to lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , who refers to a " fitness program " that keeps the company lean and efficient . the only downer at friday 's party is the airline 's catering subsidiary , lsg sky chefs .
lufthansa 's core passenger business recovered from the crisis it suffered following the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , thanks to mayrhuber 's strict regimen of savings .
but sky chefs had to cope with enormous losses in the us , sending thousands of staff on unpaid leave . some of lufthansa 's other subsidiaries have fared better .
it subsidiary lufthansa systems group , which went from simply being the airline 's computing department , to becoming an internationally recognized it provider in the past decade , is considering entering the stock market . " globally , we 're a leading provider in the airline and aviation business , " said the group 's managing director , peter franke .
" we have tripled not just our turnover , but also our number of employees . " diversification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa owes much of its success to the development of its business divisions : lufthansa cargo for logistics , technik for maintenance and repairs , sky chefs for catering , thomas cook for travel , and systems for it services .

recently unearthed documents from the ex-east german secret police , the stasi , appear to pin the 1981 assassination attempt on pope john paul ii on the kgb .
italy and bulgaria have pledged to investigate the claim . new documents found in the files of the former east german intelligence services confirm the 1981 assassination attempt against pope john paul ii was ordered by the soviet kgb and assigned to bulgarian and east german agents . according to italian newspaper corriere della sera , the documents found by the german government indicated that the kgb ordered bulgarian colleagues to carry out the killing , leaving the east german service known as the stasi to coordinate the operation and cover up the traces afterwards . bulgaria then handed the execution of the plot to turkish extremists , including mehmet ali agca , who pulled the trigger . ali agca , who is now in jail in turkey , claimed after his arrest that the operation was under the control of the bulgarian embassy in rome .

" we agreed to launch an immediate procedure for getting the documents as soon as possible , " he said . bulgarian government spokesperson dimitar tsonev confirmed his country 's readiness to cooperate in the investigation " as soon as we have an official demand " from italy . " however , the berlin office supervising the stasi archives said it had no evidence linking the stasi , or soviet and bulgarian secret services to the assassination attempt . and the former head of the stasi , marcus wolf , said on bulgarian national television that the documents concerned demands on the part of bulgaria for the stasi 's help to end a " campaign against bulgaria by the american cia .

one of the three , sergey antonov , was arrested in 1982 and put on trial but acquitted for lack of evidence . metodi andreev , former head of a bulgarian parliamentary commission entitled to open the files of the communist-era secret services , confirmed that sofia had received some stasi documents in the spring of 2002 .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .
removing the sculpture altogether - as suggested by some - was never an option for rosengold , either . " why hide it ?
then it would be as if nothing had ever happened , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe failing trafficked children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims of child trafficking are often left with nowhere to turn countries in south-east europe are failing to take successful measures against people trafficking , says a unicef report .
meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .
unicef wants to scale up this kind of strategy , because repressive laws alone wo n't work .

" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .

" the biological parameters are notably compromised , " it said , adding the " holy father - with visible participation - is joining in the continual prayers of those assisting him . " the statement was delivered as thousands of people attended a special mass in rome 's saint john in lateran cathedral . aross the world , from his native poland to indonesia via the middle east , thousands of faithful also prayed for the pontiff who has led the world 's 1.1 billion catholics for more than a quarter of a century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .

some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe failing trafficked children großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the victims of child trafficking are often left with nowhere to turn countries in south-east europe are failing to take successful measures against people trafficking , says a unicef report .
meanwhile the european union continues to treat the victims as illegal immigrants . while no one can say exactly how many people fall victim to the secretive , complex and extremely lucrative business of people trafficking , organized crime is estimated to earn between $ 7 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 5.4 billion euros and 9.2 billion euros -rrb- a year from trafficking in human beings .
however , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , does know what kind of people are trafficked – girls between the ages of 15 and 17 are sold for sexual exploitation and children under 13 are trafficked for forced labor and begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing laws ineffective many countries in south-east europe have harsh laws against trafficking , but they focus on preventing illegal migration , cracking down on prostitution and organized crime long-term strategies to root out the causes of trafficking are sorely lacking .
the young people at risk often do not have a clear idea of what trafficking is or how to protect themselves .
" people felt that it was a stranger , that they were going to get grabbed in the middle of the night on the street so prevention to them meant not going out at night , not going to discos .
in fact preventing them from having a normal life , " said deborah mcwhinney , a unicef regional adviser on trafficking .
young people need to know traffickers are often friends and sometimes even family members .
vulnerable young girls are targeted by young men who often start off as seemingly normal boyfriends , but who actually have the intention of selling the girl into prostitution .
let down in the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smuggled children are often treated as illegal immigrants and prostitutes once trafficked , the new country , often a member of the european union , lets these girls down too .
instead of treating them as the victims of a major human rights violation , they are often handled like illegal immigrants , and prostitutes .
even they decide to testify against their traffickers , the law offers them little protection .
the children hardly ever have a say in what happens to them , according to madeleine rees , director of the of human rights commission ’ s office in bosnia herzegovina .
" you said you will go through the system , but then you have no choice about what will happen to you , " she said of the plight of trafficked children . " before you know , there you are back in your own country , back in the same situation you were before with the threat those people you may have given evidence against know exactly where you are . "
what this all adds up to is a system which is not really helping the victims of trafficking , unicef 's mcwhinney said .
" definitely children are being failed .
both children suffering from abuse and neglect those who are living in institutions , those who have been abandoned as well as those who end up being trafficked , " she added .
moldavian success story there are one or two success stories , moldova , europe ’ s poorest country , has set up community services for abused children , and introduced family and life skills classes for those most at risk .
unicef wants to scale up this kind of strategy , because repressive laws alone wo n't work .
education and awareness raising are the most likely ways of prevent trafficking in the long term . imogen foulkes -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts criticize eu over human trafficking eu justice commissioner franco frattini announced wednesday the bloc would intensify efforts to stop human trafficking .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions .

" while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough .

cathedral officials in a bavarian town have now put up an explanatory plaque - but not to everyone 's satisfaction . most visitors to regensburg 's cathedral are unlikely to notice the weathered stone sculpture that 's attached to the building 's facade .
but the 650-year-old so-called " judensau , " or " jewish sow , " is a reminder of germany 's long history of persecuting jews .
similar sculptures can be found in churches throughout the country and europe and were meant to ridicule jewish people by depicting them sucking on a sow 's teats . while some churches have long put up plaques to explain the sculpture 's history , regensburg 's catholic church leaders reached a different agreement with the city 's jewish community : cathedral guides would point out the sculpture to groups and explain its origin . artist stirs up debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's cathedral sits near the danube river both sides said they were comfortable with this arrangement .
but feeling that a more permanent explanation was called for , wolfram kastner , a munich artist , staged protests against the sculpture in front of the cathedral . " for centuries , these depictions have caused murder , robberies and degradation , " kastner told reporters , adding that the term " judensau " is used by neo-nazis to this day . church officials were less than pleased with kastner 's actions . " it 's sad that someone is trying to disturb the peaceful coexistence of religions in regensburg , " said philip hockerts , a spokesman for the city 's catholic diocese . a need for historical context bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young member of regensburg 's jewish community , which has grown tremendously since the fall of communism and the arrival of jews from eastern europe but together with members of the regensburg 's jewish community , church officials came up with a text for an explanatory plaque that was unveiled next to a cathedral entrance this week . " this sculpture needs to be seen in its historical context and its anti-jewish message is disconcerting to viewers today , " the german-only plaque reads .
" nowadays , the relationship between christians and jews is one of tolerance and respect . " while church officials said at the unveiling that asking for forgiveness was the right thing to do , kastner said this was n't enough . " the plaque is lacking all the content that 's necessary , " he said , adding that he 's considering futher protests unless the wording is changed .
" this is nothing but smooth-talking . " a warning reminder regensburg 's jewish leaders said the text represented a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german worker removes a tombstone during restoration efforts in regensburg 's old jewish cemetery " it would be nice if it were a little clearer , " said hans rosengold , the spokesman for the city 's 900-member jewish community . but he agreed with hockerts that regensburg 's christians and jews were getting along just fine . " i think that people should notice that this city is already doing a lot , " he said , adding that a memorial by renowned artist dani karavan on the ground where regensburg 's medieval synagogue stood will be finished in june . besides , rosengold said that tourist guides ' remarks were much more important than a plaque on the wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe often baffled at schiavo furor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiavo case touched a religious nerve in the us the case of terri schiavo has been closely followed by europeans .
there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .
" in the netherlands , the doctors are making these decisions .
the feeding tube and the hydration are considered medical treatments and if they are determined to be futile , they can be stopped . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium followed holland in passing a law legalizing euthanasia in 2002 and ten other countries in europe allow some kind of " passive " euthanasia . in france , the practice remains illegal , although the case of vincent humbert , a man who was left blind , paralyzed and mute after an auto accident in 2000 , moved lawmakers to draft a draft " right-to-die " law that has passed the national assembly and will be debated by the senate later this year . according to dr. jean cohen , chairman of france 's association for the right to die with dignity , there are large parallels between the schiavo case and that of humbert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " most here have compassion for the patient , and are in favour of allowing death because they understand there is no point living in this state , " he told time magazine .
although there was a big difference : humbert asked to die after he was incapacitated , terri schiavo could not . condemnation but not everyone in europe sees euthanasia as a matter that should be removed from the moral sphere .
after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the circumstances of the death of mrs. terri schiavo have rightly shocked consciences .
a life has been interrupted , " said chief spokesman joaquin navarro-valls in a statement in the vatican 's first comment on schiavo 's death .
the vatican newspaper had repeatedly called the courts involved in the decisions " executioners . " " a death was arbitrarily brought forward … there can be no exceptions to the principle of the sacred nature of life from the moment of conception until its natural end . " the statement added that the holy see hoped that case would lead to legal changes . italy 's minister for european affairs , rocco buttiglione , who enraged many with his controversial comments on homosexuality and the role of women , has greeted american politicians ' involvement in the schiavo case . " it will strengthen the position of those opposing euthanasia in europe and start a debate here , " he said . not possible in germany the schiavo case could not happen in germany , however , largely because the country 's experience with state-sanctioned euthanasia of the mentally ill and others during the nazi era . " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said dr. jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of the german medical association .
" if it could be proved that -lsb- schiavo -rsb- had expressed a wish that treatment should be stopped , that would be a different matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.04.2005 europe often baffled at schiavo furor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the schiavo case touched a religious nerve in the us the case of terri schiavo has been closely followed by europeans .
there has been some condemnation of her feeding tube being removed , but the political and religious dimensions her case took on are foreign to most . for many on the eastern side of the atlantic , end-of-life debates belong within the family or in the doctor 's office , and many watched with puzzlement as the united states was thrown into a frenzy over the schiavo case . in the times of london , foreign editor bronwen maddox said the schiavo case " shows just how emphatically the us and europe are moving on different paths " when it comes to moral and social issues . that is not to say that europe has not struggled with its own ethical and medical responses to cases where patients have no chance of recovery , are living in extreme pain or , like terri schiavo , have existed for years in a persistent vegetative state . debate over regulation the debate in europe around euthanasia centers less on whether it is right or wrong than on how it should be regulated .
the netherlands is perhaps the country with the most well-known regulations around euthanasia , which has been legal under very strict conditions since 2002 . rob jonquiere , head of the pro-euthanasia group nvve , said the struggle over whether or not to remove schiavo 's feeding tube would not have taken place since " here it 's more accepted that the doctors make those decisions , " he told the washington post . " it 's terrible , this type of judicial fighting over a person who ca n't do anything about it , " he said .
" in the netherlands , the doctors are making these decisions .
the feeding tube and the hydration are considered medical treatments and if they are determined to be futile , they can be stopped . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium followed holland in passing a law legalizing euthanasia in 2002 and ten other countries in europe allow some kind of " passive " euthanasia . in france , the practice remains illegal , although the case of vincent humbert , a man who was left blind , paralyzed and mute after an auto accident in 2000 , moved lawmakers to draft a draft " right-to-die " law that has passed the national assembly and will be debated by the senate later this year . according to dr. jean cohen , chairman of france 's association for the right to die with dignity , there are large parallels between the schiavo case and that of humbert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " most here have compassion for the patient , and are in favour of allowing death because they understand there is no point living in this state , " he told time magazine .
although there was a big difference : humbert asked to die after he was incapacitated , terri schiavo could not . condemnation but not everyone in europe sees euthanasia as a matter that should be removed from the moral sphere .
after schiavo 's death on thursday , the vatican condemned the removal of the feeding tube strongly , calling it a " violation of the sacred nature of life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the circumstances of the death of mrs. terri schiavo have rightly shocked consciences .
a life has been interrupted , " said chief spokesman joaquin navarro-valls in a statement in the vatican 's first comment on schiavo 's death .
the vatican newspaper had repeatedly called the courts involved in the decisions " executioners . " " a death was arbitrarily brought forward … there can be no exceptions to the principle of the sacred nature of life from the moment of conception until its natural end . " the statement added that the holy see hoped that case would lead to legal changes . italy 's minister for european affairs , rocco buttiglione , who enraged many with his controversial comments on homosexuality and the role of women , has greeted american politicians ' involvement in the schiavo case . " it will strengthen the position of those opposing euthanasia in europe and start a debate here , " he said . not possible in germany the schiavo case could not happen in germany , however , largely because the country 's experience with state-sanctioned euthanasia of the mentally ill and others during the nazi era . " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said dr. jörg-dietrich hoppe , president of the german medical association .
" if it could be proved that -lsb- schiavo -rsb- had expressed a wish that treatment should be stopped , that would be a different matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.04.2005 for sale : holy space , cheap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like a church , but it is n't one anymore as the financial difficulties of germany ’ s mainline churches grow , parishes are increasingly facing the painful prospect of selling off their houses of worship .
some are deconsecrated and become secular establishments . at the elias church in eastern berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district , the sound of hymns has been replaced with the shouts of children playing .
in its cavernous sanctuary , a children ’ s labyrinth has been constructed , with tunnels and platforms replacing the pews .
the only worshipping here is at the altar of knowledge , and fun , as children scamper through the interactive exhibits . the elias church , with its red-brick arches and towering spires , is actually no longer a church ; it has become a children ’ s museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once holy , it 's now a children 's museum elias , as a house of worship , has fallen victim to germany ’ s increasing secularization , and a deepening financial crisis engulfing both of germany ’ s large churches .
it 's a situation that has forced them to take what might once have been considered unfathomable . due to dwindling church attendance , falling revenue from germany ’ s “ church tax ” and ever more expensive upkeep costs as church buildings age , church parishes across the country are having to consider selling off their real estate , even to secular groups or businesses . “ it ’ s an emergency solution , and one that doesn ’ t bring us enormous profits , but enables the church to get rid of a financial burden , ” said johann hinrich claussen , one of the protestant church ’ s provosts in hamburg .
“ the buildings are very expensive . ” high costs are something that neither the protestant nor the catholic churches in germany can afford these days .
membership numbers in both denominations are plummeting .
the catholics lost over two million members between 1990 and 2003 ; the protestants watched as almost double that number left the organized church . fewer members mean fewer people are paying church taxes .
that combined with a tax reform that also hit the church in the pocketbook has forced it to make a difficult choice : either divest itself of real estate holdings , or lay off personnel and end some of its social programs . since german pews are rarely full on sundays outside of christmas or easter , the church is deciding to give up some of its bricks and mortar . morally acceptable it ’ s a difficult decision for some parishes to give up a beloved building , even more difficult to watch it being used for commercial purposes . but economic realities mean churches are often happy if they can find a suitable buyer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some commercial operations , setting up shop in a former church lends just the kind of exotic cachet they ’ re looking for .
hip restaurants who always want to stand out from the crowd , often express interest in buying church buildings , which are often available for little more than a song . the st. stephanus church in hamburg , which was recently deconsecrated in a special service , has caught the eye of the celebrity cook tim mälzer , who is considering moving in his restaurant . one 19th century church in berlin has become home to a suite of high-end offices ; in cologne , an architect has redesigned one former church into a luxurious private residence ; and in the brandenburg village of milow , a branch of germany ’ s savings bank -lrb- sparkasse -rrb- has moved into a protestant chapel , two millennia after the bible says jesus threw the moneychangers out of the temple . “ restaurants or some stores are acceptable , ” said claussen .
“ we just have to make sure no ecclesiastic objects are used for commercial purpose , like in london .
there , they weren ’ t careful and an altar was used for something like a salad bar . ” churches however are particular about who they 're selling out to . businesses such as bars or discos are strictly ruled out .
“ we couldn ’ t go along with anything that we consider immoral , ” said claussen . is there a market ? although for many businesses , the idea of having a church building is an attractive one , in reality , the market for churches is not exactly booming , according to marcus nitschke from d : 4 , a firm in berlin which consults churches and possible clients about renovating churches and finding new uses for them . “ there are a lot of ideas , but in terms of actual conversions , there aren ’ t as many , ” he said .
“ it ’ s simply much too expensive . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he said questions like insulation , heating , cooling , putting in disabled access , appropriate toilets , or outfitting a commercial kitchen require much more money and work than many business are ready to invest , even if the final result might prove a customer magnet . “ we advise the parishes to sell their other real estate holdings and use the churches as much as they can , ” he said .
if the upkeep of the house of worship is impossible , he would suggest tearing the structure down if it isn ’ t categorized as a protected monument by the government . future with fewer churches that option could be more frequently used in the future .
according to claussen , germany has too many churches , particularly in several of its big cities , like hamburg or berlin .
he says in the post-war years , church policy was to build , and build some more .
the bishop of hamburg once said he didn ’ t want any parishioner in the inner city to be forced to walk more than ten minutes before reaching a church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as population structures have changed , that has led to a surfeit of houses of worship , where on any given sunday , the number of people attending services could be counted on both hands .
claussen estimates the protestant church will likely have to either tear down , or sell about a fourth of its churches .
among catholics , the numbers are similar . yet many parishioners would rather see their churches used for other purposes than simply be bulldozed out of existence , even if that does mean handing the keys over to a clothing store , a youth center , or a high-end eatery . sabine küster is a consultant who works with churches and those interested in them .
she says she continues to get a lot of inquiries from companies and cultural organizations interested in acquiring some sacred space . “ i try to get the partners together , where i think it will work , ” she said , but added she had to approach the subject with kid gloves .
“ it ’ s a sensitive subject , and i don ’ t want to turn every disco owner loose on every parish council . ” kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's churches bear a financial cross taking care of people ’ s souls can take a lot of money , and germany 's catholic and protestant churches , funded mostly by taxes , are joining the nation 's 4.25 million unemployed in praying for economic recovery .

recently unearthed documents from the ex-east german secret police , the stasi , appear to pin the 1981 assassination attempt on pope john paul ii on the kgb .
italy and bulgaria have pledged to investigate the claim . new documents found in the files of the former east german intelligence services confirm the 1981 assassination attempt against pope john paul ii was ordered by the soviet kgb and assigned to bulgarian and east german agents . according to italian newspaper corriere della sera , the documents found by the german government indicated that the kgb ordered bulgarian colleagues to carry out the killing , leaving the east german service known as the stasi to coordinate the operation and cover up the traces afterwards . bulgaria then handed the execution of the plot to turkish extremists , including mehmet ali agca , who pulled the trigger . ali agca , who is now in jail in turkey , claimed after his arrest that the operation was under the control of the bulgarian embassy in rome .
the bulgarians have always insisted they were innocent and argued that agca 's story was part of an anti-communist plot by the italian secret service and the cia . bulgaria and italy to cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secrets to be unraveled the documents consist mostly of letters from stasi operatives to their bulgarian counterparts seeking help in covering up traces after the attack and denying bulgarian involvement . so far , bulgaria has declared its readiness to give italy all the information it possesses about the alleged involvement of its then communist secret services in the assassination attempt on pope john paul ii , an italian deputy told bulgarian btv television thursday . paolo gozzanti , head of the parliamentary commission inquiring into the activities of the soviet kgb in italy during the cold war , said the bulgarian ambassador in rome had promised to help him obtain relevant documents that the former stasi sent to bulgaria in 2002 . " we agreed to launch an immediate procedure for getting the documents as soon as possible , " he said . bulgarian government spokesperson dimitar tsonev confirmed his country 's readiness to cooperate in the investigation " as soon as we have an official demand " from italy . " however , the berlin office supervising the stasi archives said it had no evidence linking the stasi , or soviet and bulgarian secret services to the assassination attempt . and the former head of the stasi , marcus wolf , said on bulgarian national television that the documents concerned demands on the part of bulgaria for the stasi 's help to end a " campaign against bulgaria by the american cia . " wolf added that the files also had been sent to italy in 1995 . pope believed assassin was a ' patsy ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : answers before pope 's death ?
three bulgarians were accused of masterminding the assassination attempt on may 13 , 1981 .
one of the three , sergey antonov , was arrested in 1982 and put on trial but acquitted for lack of evidence . metodi andreev , former head of a bulgarian parliamentary commission entitled to open the files of the communist-era secret services , confirmed that sofia had received some stasi documents in the spring of 2002 . " i do not know if they is any proof of a bulgarian involvement in the attack but we need to clear up that problem in order not to throw a shadow on contemporary bulgaria , " he said . gozzanti said it was necessary to find out the truth before the death of the pope , who has said in his own memoir , " memory and identity : conversations between millenniums , " that ali agca was a tool of outside forces .
and in a visit to bulgaria in may 2002 , the pope said he " never believed in the so-called bulgarian connection .

the 33-year-old is in his second stint as a junior doctor after deciding to become a gp and remembers the days of working way over his allotted hours .
and as deputy chair of the sjdc he knows how the new system will operate in helping medics to work within the limits defined by the new deal .
here , dr thomson gives an insight into the problems faced by junior doctors and the problems of being overworked on the wards . "
i currently work on a rota that is compliant with the new deal .
but i do remember the days when i was required to work in excess of 80 and 90 hours a week .
it was a while ago i was working on rotas that were so badly non-compliant .
if you were called to something that was an emergency then the adrenalin would normally keep you going and you would n't make any mistakes .
but it was on the more day-to-day duties and repetitive stuff where the tiredness would take hold and you would find yourself making mistakes or unable to take any information in .
this used to bring patient and also doctor safety into question , but thankfully the majority of rotas in scotland are now compliant with the new deal .

the fact that most doctors no longer work such long hours means that they now have a chance to have a social and a family life and to do the background work that is needed in our positions .
as junior doctors , our positions are still ones where we are supposed to be in training and we still need time to learn things and work on what we have been told outside of normal working hours .
the work of the implementation support group -lrb- isg -rrb- can not be ignored either .
it is the neutral group which has worked to help make so many rotas comply with the new deal and since it has been in charge rates of compliance have gone up from 30 % to nearly 90 % .
the working relationships that the isg has helped set up between the different sections involved in trying to comply with the new deal have been very positive and its impact should not be ignored .
there has been talk of removing the group from its responsibilities within the near future and replacing it with a more decentralised body , but most doctors in my position feel this would represent a retrograde step . "
all these moves are there to try and improve the quality of the nhs in scotland and improve the level of medical expertise of the junior doctors that work within it " i would like to see the day when there is 100 % compliance but realistically there are one , two or three rotas in the nhs in scotland which realistically will never be able to become compliant with the new deal rules .
that still means 99 % could become compliant and so there is still room for improvement within the nhs .
the sanctions , which are to be introduced to try and achieve this , are there to help the nhs trusts achieve this sort of compliance but they are also there to support them and are not just there as a penalty .
hopefully , in the future we can achieve a position where doctors work a 48-hour week in line with the european working time directive .
all these moves are there to try and improve the quality of the nhs in scotland and improve the level of medical expertise of the junior doctors who work within it .
but most importantly it will mean protecting the health of our patients which , at the end of the day , is why we are here as doctors in the first place . "

britain 's blue flag beaches , published on friday , lists 109 welsh beaches and is the only official guide to the uk 's blue flag and seaside award beaches .
it has been produced by encams , which organises the flag awards , and tourism agency visit britain .
the welsh beaches include aberdaron in gwynedd , barafundle bay in pembrokeshire and borth in ceredigion .
the writers said there had been a vast improvement in the state of the beaches over the past 10 years .
a report also released on friday by encams found british beach-goers had become much more discerning and were put off by dirty toilets , traffic jams and poor parking in and around seaside towns .
however , more than 50 % of people still enjoyed at least one day a year beside the seaside .
' quality ' alan woods , chief executive of encams , said : " had we written this guide a decade ago , we would have really struggled to recommend anywhere , such was the state of our coastline .
borth beaches has regained its blue flag on the 2004 list " but the stinging criticism aimed at many beach managers and water companies , has made them sit up and invest heavily in improvements " some towns have even tried to re-define their image , moving away from the candyfloss and kiss-me-quick cliches and pitching themselves as places where everyone can enjoy a quality day out . "
the guide includes 27 pembrokeshire beaches and 12 in ceredigion .
in a survey last year , aberystwyth north and saundersfoot beaches got the highest scores in wales for cleanliness .
in total , 35 welsh beaches won the top award of the blue flag in 2004 .
the results contrast with a survey just last week which found welsh beaches had a higher density of litter than in any other part of the uk .
the marine conservation society 's beachwatch initiative , which looked at 27 welsh beaches , found there were over 2,600 items per kilometre of coastline surveyed .
as well as litter left behind by tourists , a significant problem for wales was the amount washed up by the tide .

britain 's blue flag beaches , published on friday , lists 109 welsh beaches and is the only official guide to the uk 's blue flag and seaside award beaches .
it has been produced by encams , which organises the flag awards , and tourism agency visit britain .
the welsh beaches include aberdaron in gwynedd , barafundle bay in pembrokeshire and borth in ceredigion .
the writers said there had been a vast improvement in the state of the beaches over the past 10 years .

borth beaches has regained its blue flag on the 2004 list " but the stinging criticism aimed at many beach managers and water companies , has made them sit up and invest heavily in improvements " some towns have even tried to re-define their image , moving away from the candyfloss and kiss-me-quick cliches and pitching themselves as places where everyone can enjoy a quality day out . "
the guide includes 27 pembrokeshire beaches and 12 in ceredigion .
in a survey last year , aberystwyth north and saundersfoot beaches got the highest scores in wales for cleanliness .
in total , 35 welsh beaches won the top award of the blue flag in 2004 .
the results contrast with a survey just last week which found welsh beaches had a higher density of litter than in any other part of the uk .
the marine conservation society 's beachwatch initiative , which looked at 27 welsh beaches , found there were over 2,600 items per kilometre of coastline surveyed .
as well as litter left behind by tourists , a significant problem for wales was the amount washed up by the tide .

at its board meeting in washington , the bank said it would provide loans and guarantees for the $ 1.2bn project .
the decision comes after nearly 10 years of discussions with the laos government .
but critics say the environmental and social costs of the dam , called nam theun 2 , are far too high .
laos is a poor , landlocked country which has few viable industries .
but it does have plenty of mountains and rivers , and that is why it is pinning its hopes for the future on hydroelectric power .
nam theun 2 is the country 's largest dam project , on a tributary of the mighty mekong .
it is designed to produce electricity for export to neighbouring thailand , earning valuable foreign currency that laos says it will use to alleviate poverty .
but critics are not convinced .
they say the dam will damage the environment and undermine the livelihoods of tens of thousands of local villagers .
for the world bank , the dam is also risky .
in the past , it has faced a massive outcry after backing similar dams in other developing countries .
the bank says this time it is confident that the dam 's benefits will outweigh the negative impacts .

the tax replaces a host of existing add-on tariffs and is aimed at simplifying india 's bewildering tax system while generating more revenue .
but traders who oppose the tax have forced markets across india to shut for a third straight day .
they say the move increases paperwork while forcing them to pay more .
vat is taking effect in 21 of 28 indian states which have decided to implement it .
under the proposed system , two rates of 4 % and 12.5 % will be imposed on most of the products on which various kinds of sales taxes are levied at present . "
we are continuing our strike against vat , which will keep prices high and affect the poor " praveen khandelwal , confederation of all india traders analysis : vat 's the problem ?
certain commodities like petroleum products , alcohol and lottery tickets have been exempted .
officials say they are optimistic that opposition to the tax will die away .
" we have 21 states on board and i am sure the others will join within a month and a half , " ramesh chandra , the official overseeing vat implementation , told reuters news agency .
price rise fear but the tax , which has been delayed five times in the past 10 years , is being opposed by traders who argue that the tax department is not prepared to implement it , and that they will be forced to pay higher taxes .
" we are continuing our strike against vat , which will keep prices high and affect the poor , " praveen khandelwal of the confederation of all india traders is quoted as saying by the press trust of india .
but independent analysts say the introduction of vat will make tax evasion much more difficult .
