she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .
while former chancellor gerhard schröder 's internet presence could be found at www.bundeskanzler.de , the address now automatically links to bundeskanzlerin.bundesregierung.de -lrb- chancelloress.federalgovernment.de -rrb- . a pr consultant , who holds the rights to www.bundeskanzlerin.de , has said that he would offer the name to germany 's first female chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .
over 3,000 medical studies show the health properties of beer -lrb- it is rich in b vitamins , silica , magnesium and antioxidants -rrb- when it is consumed moderately . ' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria recently found a way to concentrate the levels of this antioxidant , called xanthohumol , and is marketing its mixed-beer brew under the name xan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karla - sold in pharmacies , and aimed at middle-aged women germany ’ s karlsberg brewery is going a step further in marketing beer as a health drink .
it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?
that is bound to happen .
people who are in the forefront and who are leaders in a society usually attract this kind of attention .
in time , it will be her decisions that will get the attention .
in time , it will be her leadership that will get the attention .
it 's the leadership that 's most important right now , and as leadership strengthens , the other agenda that is in the forefront right now will decrease in the attention of the people .
they will look at her as a leader who is making pretty good decisions for their lives .
you wanted turkey to become an eu member as soon as possible .
merkel prefers a " privileged partnership . "
how do you feel about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tansu ciller it 's one thing , what you think as the opposition leader .
it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .
i do hope that as a leader with a vision she will see the future and think of the advantages for her country - which i feel will benefit extremely from the eu membership of turkey . christine harjes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .

like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?

in time , it will be her leadership that will get the attention .
it 's the leadership that 's most important right now , and as leadership strengthens , the other agenda that is in the forefront right now will decrease in the attention of the people .
they will look at her as a leader who is making pretty good decisions for their lives .
you wanted turkey to become an eu member as soon as possible .
merkel prefers a " privileged partnership . "
how do you feel about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tansu ciller it 's one thing , what you think as the opposition leader .
it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .

eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .
so far the americans remain silent . the european union wants the united states to clarify reports about the way its cia spy agency handles suspected islamic extremists as part of anti-terrorism activities , danish foreign minister per stig moeller said monday . " we say in all friendship to the united states , ' what is this ?
you ca n't be satisfied with all these rumors and neither are we ' , " moeller told danish news agency ritzau after a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels . washington has refused to confirm or deny press reports about the central intelligence agency 's use of european airports to transfer suspected islamic extremists around the globe , and so-called " black site " covert prisons in eastern europe , afghanistan , thailand and elsewhere . " we say -lrb- to the americans -rrb- : a lot of countries have been named in relation to this , and we can guess at a lot of others in connection with these prisons , " he said .
" so we would like you to tell us something about it . "
" we only have rumors " british foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , did not mention any formal demand to the united states about the matter , the news agency said . but moeller said ministers wanted an explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us stays silent " the general desire -lrb- of the meeting -rrb- was to clarify this situation that has been raised in all the newspapers while none of us knows anything about it , " he said .
" but there has not been any declaration because there is no basis for justifying it .
there are no facts .
we have only rumors . " also monday , a danish lawmaker alleged that aircraft chartered by the cia to transport suspects flew illegally over greenland , which is ruled by copenhagen . danish transport minister flemming hansen had confirmed in a written response to a question that two planes used by the cia crossed into greenland 's airspace , deputy frank aaen . " these flights , the dates of which the minister did not specify , were illegal under international aviation protocols , as they were not civil flights and should thus have had prior authorization , " said aaen . romania allows access meanwhile , romanian officials said they are ready to allow investigators access to two military bases to prove they were not used by the cia as secret prisons , romanian president traian basescu told french newspaper le figaro monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war on terrorists - not always successfull during the interview , basescu denied a report by the washington post confirming the existence of secret prisons used to hold suspected terrorists in eastern europe and thailand .
poland and romania were identified as the locations by us-based ngo human rights watch , but both countries have denied the allegations .
romania is a candidate for eu membership and poland is already a member of the 25-nation bloc . " there are no such prisons in romania , " the president said .
" we are open to an investigation on the bases of timisoara and kogalniceanu which are suspected of housing such prisons .

but his boss claims the drug came from a treatment for baldness . at first , it seemed a bizarre claim and one designed solely to get 1860 munich 's serbia and montenegro forward nemanja vucicevic off the hook . vucicevic found himself at the center of a doping scandal in germany on monday after it was revealed he was being investigated by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- after giving a positive sample after the match with fellow second division club burghausen on nov .
4 .
leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .
vucicevic is not the first sportsman to be caught out by the drug .
argentina 's doubles tennis star mariano hood tested positive for finasteride at this year 's french open .
hood claims to have been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent his own hair loss .
the treatment was added to the atp tennis federation 's list of banned drugs last november as a masking agent . despite the fact that finasteride is a banned substance in many sports , anyone who used the treatment for more nefarious reasons would also know that its medical application could be used in their defense while taking it to cover up more sinister practices .
in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?
it would also have to go some way to beat that of us sprinter dennis mitchell who claimed that the banned hormone testosterone in his sample was the result of having sex four times and consuming five bottles of beer during the evening prior to a big race . however , finasteride would make for a strange choice of drug to take if performance enhancement was the ultimate goal .
finasteride comes with a number of side effects such as loss of libido , testicular pain , breast tenderness and enlargement - hardly the symptoms an active sportsman would want to take a chance with . so for now , the jury is out on what exactly is the bald truth in this case . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .
amnesty international has documented 38 different torture methods , including electric shocks and beatings with wires , being used there . human rights groups say the united states and its western allies deny the use of torture by their own agents but are happy to use intelligence obtained under torture by third countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent allegations suggest the cia transports suspects to prisons via europe washington denies outsourcing torture but has acknowledged secretly moving suspects between countries to be interrogated in the " war on terrorism , " a process known as rendition . the bnd and federal police , as well as the german foreign ministry , have so far declined to comment on the magazine report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence agency spied on journalists the head of germany 's foreign intelligence service confirmed on thursday that his agency spied on journalists in the 1990s .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .
while former chancellor gerhard schröder 's internet presence could be found at www.bundeskanzler.de , the address now automatically links to bundeskanzlerin.bundesregierung.de -lrb- chancelloress.federalgovernment.de -rrb- . a pr consultant , who holds the rights to www.bundeskanzlerin.de , has said that he would offer the name to germany 's first female chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?
that is bound to happen .
people who are in the forefront and who are leaders in a society usually attract this kind of attention .
in time , it will be her decisions that will get the attention .
in time , it will be her leadership that will get the attention .
it 's the leadership that 's most important right now , and as leadership strengthens , the other agenda that is in the forefront right now will decrease in the attention of the people .
they will look at her as a leader who is making pretty good decisions for their lives .
you wanted turkey to become an eu member as soon as possible .
merkel prefers a " privileged partnership . "
how do you feel about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tansu ciller it 's one thing , what you think as the opposition leader .
it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .
i do hope that as a leader with a vision she will see the future and think of the advantages for her country - which i feel will benefit extremely from the eu membership of turkey . christine harjes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2005 conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no denying he has a hair deficit nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .
but his boss claims the drug came from a treatment for baldness . at first , it seemed a bizarre claim and one designed solely to get 1860 munich 's serbia and montenegro forward nemanja vucicevic off the hook . vucicevic found himself at the center of a doping scandal in germany on monday after it was revealed he was being investigated by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- after giving a positive sample after the match with fellow second division club burghausen on nov .
4 .
leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .
vucicevic is not the first sportsman to be caught out by the drug .
argentina 's doubles tennis star mariano hood tested positive for finasteride at this year 's french open .
hood claims to have been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent his own hair loss .
the treatment was added to the atp tennis federation 's list of banned drugs last november as a masking agent . despite the fact that finasteride is a banned substance in many sports , anyone who used the treatment for more nefarious reasons would also know that its medical application could be used in their defense while taking it to cover up more sinister practices .
in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?
it would also have to go some way to beat that of us sprinter dennis mitchell who claimed that the banned hormone testosterone in his sample was the result of having sex four times and consuming five bottles of beer during the evening prior to a big race . however , finasteride would make for a strange choice of drug to take if performance enhancement was the ultimate goal .
finasteride comes with a number of side effects such as loss of libido , testicular pain , breast tenderness and enlargement - hardly the symptoms an active sportsman would want to take a chance with . so for now , the jury is out on what exactly is the bald truth in this case . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .

' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria recently found a way to concentrate the levels of this antioxidant , called xanthohumol , and is marketing its mixed-beer brew under the name xan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karla - sold in pharmacies , and aimed at middle-aged women germany ’ s karlsberg brewery is going a step further in marketing beer as a health drink .
it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .

" pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .

it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .

" we say in all friendship to the united states , ' what is this ?

" we say -lrb- to the americans -rrb- : a lot of countries have been named in relation to this , and we can guess at a lot of others in connection with these prisons , " he said .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?

people who are in the forefront and who are leaders in a society usually attract this kind of attention .

it 's the leadership that 's most important right now , and as leadership strengthens , the other agenda that is in the forefront right now will decrease in the attention of the people .
they will look at her as a leader who is making pretty good decisions for their lives .
you wanted turkey to become an eu member as soon as possible .
merkel prefers a " privileged partnership . "
how do you feel about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tansu ciller it 's one thing , what you think as the opposition leader .
it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .
i do hope that as a leader with a vision she will see the future and think of the advantages for her country - which i feel will benefit extremely from the eu membership of turkey . christine harjes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .

it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .
amnesty international has documented 38 different torture methods , including electric shocks and beatings with wires , being used there . human rights groups say the united states and its western allies deny the use of torture by their own agents but are happy to use intelligence obtained under torture by third countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent allegations suggest the cia transports suspects to prisons via europe washington denies outsourcing torture but has acknowledged secretly moving suspects between countries to be interrogated in the " war on terrorism , " a process known as rendition . the bnd and federal police , as well as the german foreign ministry , have so far declined to comment on the magazine report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence agency spied on journalists the head of germany 's foreign intelligence service confirmed on thursday that his agency spied on journalists in the 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 22.11.2005 angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " so help me god " : chancellor angela merkel takes the oath of office angela merkel has been sworn in as germany 's head of government after parliamentarians elected her as the first female chancellor on tuesday . angela merkel was elected by a decisive margin , receiving 397 of the 611 valid parliamentary votes .
she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .
over 3,000 medical studies show the health properties of beer -lrb- it is rich in b vitamins , silica , magnesium and antioxidants -rrb- when it is consumed moderately . ' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria recently found a way to concentrate the levels of this antioxidant , called xanthohumol , and is marketing its mixed-beer brew under the name xan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karla - sold in pharmacies , and aimed at middle-aged women germany ’ s karlsberg brewery is going a step further in marketing beer as a health drink .
it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .
so we originally aimed it at them , ” kirch said .
but , he added , “ karla has done almost equally well among men , too . ” jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .

leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?
that is bound to happen .
people who are in the forefront and who are leaders in a society usually attract this kind of attention .
in time , it will be her decisions that will get the attention .
in time , it will be her leadership that will get the attention .
it 's the leadership that 's most important right now , and as leadership strengthens , the other agenda that is in the forefront right now will decrease in the attention of the people .
they will look at her as a leader who is making pretty good decisions for their lives .
you wanted turkey to become an eu member as soon as possible .
merkel prefers a " privileged partnership . "
how do you feel about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tansu ciller it 's one thing , what you think as the opposition leader .
it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .
i do hope that as a leader with a vision she will see the future and think of the advantages for her country - which i feel will benefit extremely from the eu membership of turkey . christine harjes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.11.2005 german brewers court women drinkers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsberg 's ' karla ' is seeking to win over health-conscious women beer consumption - and sales - in germany have been on the skids for years .
now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .
over 3,000 medical studies show the health properties of beer -lrb- it is rich in b vitamins , silica , magnesium and antioxidants -rrb- when it is consumed moderately . ' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria recently found a way to concentrate the levels of this antioxidant , called xanthohumol , and is marketing its mixed-beer brew under the name xan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karla - sold in pharmacies , and aimed at middle-aged women germany ’ s karlsberg brewery is going a step further in marketing beer as a health drink .
it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .
so we originally aimed it at them , ” kirch said .
but , he added , “ karla has done almost equally well among men , too . ” jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .

domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .

" pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .

' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 22.11.2005 angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " so help me god " : chancellor angela merkel takes the oath of office angela merkel has been sworn in as germany 's head of government after parliamentarians elected her as the first female chancellor on tuesday . angela merkel was elected by a decisive margin , receiving 397 of the 611 valid parliamentary votes .
she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .
while former chancellor gerhard schröder 's internet presence could be found at www.bundeskanzler.de , the address now automatically links to bundeskanzlerin.bundesregierung.de -lrb- chancelloress.federalgovernment.de -rrb- . a pr consultant , who holds the rights to www.bundeskanzlerin.de , has said that he would offer the name to germany 's first female chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .

the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .

leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .
vucicevic is not the first sportsman to be caught out by the drug .
argentina 's doubles tennis star mariano hood tested positive for finasteride at this year 's french open .
hood claims to have been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent his own hair loss .
the treatment was added to the atp tennis federation 's list of banned drugs last november as a masking agent . despite the fact that finasteride is a banned substance in many sports , anyone who used the treatment for more nefarious reasons would also know that its medical application could be used in their defense while taking it to cover up more sinister practices .
in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?
it would also have to go some way to beat that of us sprinter dennis mitchell who claimed that the banned hormone testosterone in his sample was the result of having sex four times and consuming five bottles of beer during the evening prior to a big race . however , finasteride would make for a strange choice of drug to take if performance enhancement was the ultimate goal .
finasteride comes with a number of side effects such as loss of libido , testicular pain , breast tenderness and enlargement - hardly the symptoms an active sportsman would want to take a chance with . so for now , the jury is out on what exactly is the bald truth in this case . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?
that is bound to happen .
people who are in the forefront and who are leaders in a society usually attract this kind of attention .
in time , it will be her decisions that will get the attention .
in time , it will be her leadership that will get the attention .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .
while former chancellor gerhard schröder 's internet presence could be found at www.bundeskanzler.de , the address now automatically links to bundeskanzlerin.bundesregierung.de -lrb- chancelloress.federalgovernment.de -rrb- . a pr consultant , who holds the rights to www.bundeskanzlerin.de , has said that he would offer the name to germany 's first female chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .
while former chancellor gerhard schröder 's internet presence could be found at www.bundeskanzler.de , the address now automatically links to bundeskanzlerin.bundesregierung.de -lrb- chancelloress.federalgovernment.de -rrb- . a pr consultant , who holds the rights to www.bundeskanzlerin.de , has said that he would offer the name to germany 's first female chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .
amnesty international has documented 38 different torture methods , including electric shocks and beatings with wires , being used there . human rights groups say the united states and its western allies deny the use of torture by their own agents but are happy to use intelligence obtained under torture by third countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent allegations suggest the cia transports suspects to prisons via europe washington denies outsourcing torture but has acknowledged secretly moving suspects between countries to be interrogated in the " war on terrorism , " a process known as rendition . the bnd and federal police , as well as the german foreign ministry , have so far declined to comment on the magazine report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence agency spied on journalists the head of germany 's foreign intelligence service confirmed on thursday that his agency spied on journalists in the 1990s .

the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .

eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .
so far the americans remain silent . the european union wants the united states to clarify reports about the way its cia spy agency handles suspected islamic extremists as part of anti-terrorism activities , danish foreign minister per stig moeller said monday . " we say in all friendship to the united states , ' what is this ?
you ca n't be satisfied with all these rumors and neither are we ' , " moeller told danish news agency ritzau after a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels . washington has refused to confirm or deny press reports about the central intelligence agency 's use of european airports to transfer suspected islamic extremists around the globe , and so-called " black site " covert prisons in eastern europe , afghanistan , thailand and elsewhere . " we say -lrb- to the americans -rrb- : a lot of countries have been named in relation to this , and we can guess at a lot of others in connection with these prisons , " he said .
" so we would like you to tell us something about it . "
" we only have rumors " british foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , did not mention any formal demand to the united states about the matter , the news agency said . but moeller said ministers wanted an explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us stays silent " the general desire -lrb- of the meeting -rrb- was to clarify this situation that has been raised in all the newspapers while none of us knows anything about it , " he said .
" but there has not been any declaration because there is no basis for justifying it .
there are no facts .
we have only rumors . " also monday , a danish lawmaker alleged that aircraft chartered by the cia to transport suspects flew illegally over greenland , which is ruled by copenhagen . danish transport minister flemming hansen had confirmed in a written response to a question that two planes used by the cia crossed into greenland 's airspace , deputy frank aaen . " these flights , the dates of which the minister did not specify , were illegal under international aviation protocols , as they were not civil flights and should thus have had prior authorization , " said aaen . romania allows access meanwhile , romanian officials said they are ready to allow investigators access to two military bases to prove they were not used by the cia as secret prisons , romanian president traian basescu told french newspaper le figaro monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war on terrorists - not always successfull during the interview , basescu denied a report by the washington post confirming the existence of secret prisons used to hold suspected terrorists in eastern europe and thailand .
poland and romania were identified as the locations by us-based ngo human rights watch , but both countries have denied the allegations .
romania is a candidate for eu membership and poland is already a member of the 25-nation bloc . " there are no such prisons in romania , " the president said .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .
amnesty international has documented 38 different torture methods , including electric shocks and beatings with wires , being used there . human rights groups say the united states and its western allies deny the use of torture by their own agents but are happy to use intelligence obtained under torture by third countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent allegations suggest the cia transports suspects to prisons via europe washington denies outsourcing torture but has acknowledged secretly moving suspects between countries to be interrogated in the " war on terrorism , " a process known as rendition . the bnd and federal police , as well as the german foreign ministry , have so far declined to comment on the magazine report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence agency spied on journalists the head of germany 's foreign intelligence service confirmed on thursday that his agency spied on journalists in the 1990s .

but his boss claims the drug came from a treatment for baldness . at first , it seemed a bizarre claim and one designed solely to get 1860 munich 's serbia and montenegro forward nemanja vucicevic off the hook . vucicevic found himself at the center of a doping scandal in germany on monday after it was revealed he was being investigated by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- after giving a positive sample after the match with fellow second division club burghausen on nov .
4 .
leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .
vucicevic is not the first sportsman to be caught out by the drug .
argentina 's doubles tennis star mariano hood tested positive for finasteride at this year 's french open .
hood claims to have been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent his own hair loss .
the treatment was added to the atp tennis federation 's list of banned drugs last november as a masking agent . despite the fact that finasteride is a banned substance in many sports , anyone who used the treatment for more nefarious reasons would also know that its medical application could be used in their defense while taking it to cover up more sinister practices .
in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?
it would also have to go some way to beat that of us sprinter dennis mitchell who claimed that the banned hormone testosterone in his sample was the result of having sex four times and consuming five bottles of beer during the evening prior to a big race . however , finasteride would make for a strange choice of drug to take if performance enhancement was the ultimate goal .
finasteride comes with a number of side effects such as loss of libido , testicular pain , breast tenderness and enlargement - hardly the symptoms an active sportsman would want to take a chance with . so for now , the jury is out on what exactly is the bald truth in this case . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .

the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .
while former chancellor gerhard schröder 's internet presence could be found at www.bundeskanzler.de , the address now automatically links to bundeskanzlerin.bundesregierung.de -lrb- chancelloress.federalgovernment.de -rrb- . a pr consultant , who holds the rights to www.bundeskanzlerin.de , has said that he would offer the name to germany 's first female chancellor . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de well-wishers congratulate merkel heads of state and business representatives alike sent congratulations to germany 's newly-inaugurated chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.11.2005 come clean on secret cia prisons , eu tells us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret cia prisons in europe ?
eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .
so far the americans remain silent . the european union wants the united states to clarify reports about the way its cia spy agency handles suspected islamic extremists as part of anti-terrorism activities , danish foreign minister per stig moeller said monday . " we say in all friendship to the united states , ' what is this ?
you ca n't be satisfied with all these rumors and neither are we ' , " moeller told danish news agency ritzau after a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels . washington has refused to confirm or deny press reports about the central intelligence agency 's use of european airports to transfer suspected islamic extremists around the globe , and so-called " black site " covert prisons in eastern europe , afghanistan , thailand and elsewhere . " we say -lrb- to the americans -rrb- : a lot of countries have been named in relation to this , and we can guess at a lot of others in connection with these prisons , " he said .
" so we would like you to tell us something about it . "
" we only have rumors " british foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , did not mention any formal demand to the united states about the matter , the news agency said . but moeller said ministers wanted an explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us stays silent " the general desire -lrb- of the meeting -rrb- was to clarify this situation that has been raised in all the newspapers while none of us knows anything about it , " he said .
" but there has not been any declaration because there is no basis for justifying it .
there are no facts .
we have only rumors . " also monday , a danish lawmaker alleged that aircraft chartered by the cia to transport suspects flew illegally over greenland , which is ruled by copenhagen . danish transport minister flemming hansen had confirmed in a written response to a question that two planes used by the cia crossed into greenland 's airspace , deputy frank aaen . " these flights , the dates of which the minister did not specify , were illegal under international aviation protocols , as they were not civil flights and should thus have had prior authorization , " said aaen . romania allows access meanwhile , romanian officials said they are ready to allow investigators access to two military bases to prove they were not used by the cia as secret prisons , romanian president traian basescu told french newspaper le figaro monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war on terrorists - not always successfull during the interview , basescu denied a report by the washington post confirming the existence of secret prisons used to hold suspected terrorists in eastern europe and thailand .
poland and romania were identified as the locations by us-based ngo human rights watch , but both countries have denied the allegations .

eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .
so far the americans remain silent . the european union wants the united states to clarify reports about the way its cia spy agency handles suspected islamic extremists as part of anti-terrorism activities , danish foreign minister per stig moeller said monday . " we say in all friendship to the united states , ' what is this ?
you ca n't be satisfied with all these rumors and neither are we ' , " moeller told danish news agency ritzau after a meeting of european foreign ministers in brussels . washington has refused to confirm or deny press reports about the central intelligence agency 's use of european airports to transfer suspected islamic extremists around the globe , and so-called " black site " covert prisons in eastern europe , afghanistan , thailand and elsewhere . " we say -lrb- to the americans -rrb- : a lot of countries have been named in relation to this , and we can guess at a lot of others in connection with these prisons , " he said .
" so we would like you to tell us something about it . "
" we only have rumors " british foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , did not mention any formal demand to the united states about the matter , the news agency said . but moeller said ministers wanted an explanation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us stays silent " the general desire -lrb- of the meeting -rrb- was to clarify this situation that has been raised in all the newspapers while none of us knows anything about it , " he said .
" but there has not been any declaration because there is no basis for justifying it .
there are no facts .
we have only rumors . " also monday , a danish lawmaker alleged that aircraft chartered by the cia to transport suspects flew illegally over greenland , which is ruled by copenhagen . danish transport minister flemming hansen had confirmed in a written response to a question that two planes used by the cia crossed into greenland 's airspace , deputy frank aaen . " these flights , the dates of which the minister did not specify , were illegal under international aviation protocols , as they were not civil flights and should thus have had prior authorization , " said aaen . romania allows access meanwhile , romanian officials said they are ready to allow investigators access to two military bases to prove they were not used by the cia as secret prisons , romanian president traian basescu told french newspaper le figaro monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the war on terrorists - not always successfull during the interview , basescu denied a report by the washington post confirming the existence of secret prisons used to hold suspected terrorists in eastern europe and thailand .
poland and romania were identified as the locations by us-based ngo human rights watch , but both countries have denied the allegations .
romania is a candidate for eu membership and poland is already a member of the 25-nation bloc . " there are no such prisons in romania , " the president said .
" we are open to an investigation on the bases of timisoara and kogalniceanu which are suspected of housing such prisons . " the council of europe is investigating the charges . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition says germany should probe cia prison allegations germany has been named as a stopping off point for planes that allegedly transported terror suspects to secret cia prisons in european countries .
the government has no plans to investigate .
the opposition says it should .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .

and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.11.2005 german brewers court women drinkers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsberg 's ' karla ' is seeking to win over health-conscious women beer consumption - and sales - in germany have been on the skids for years .
now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .
over 3,000 medical studies show the health properties of beer -lrb- it is rich in b vitamins , silica , magnesium and antioxidants -rrb- when it is consumed moderately . ' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria recently found a way to concentrate the levels of this antioxidant , called xanthohumol , and is marketing its mixed-beer brew under the name xan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karla - sold in pharmacies , and aimed at middle-aged women germany ’ s karlsberg brewery is going a step further in marketing beer as a health drink .
it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .
so we originally aimed it at them , ” kirch said .
but , he added , “ karla has done almost equally well among men , too . ” jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .

that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .

but his boss claims the drug came from a treatment for baldness . at first , it seemed a bizarre claim and one designed solely to get 1860 munich 's serbia and montenegro forward nemanja vucicevic off the hook . vucicevic found himself at the center of a doping scandal in germany on monday after it was revealed he was being investigated by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- after giving a positive sample after the match with fellow second division club burghausen on nov .

leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to the chancellery opinion : germany 's new opposition the crunch issues schröder confirms exit ; slams bush the chancellor vote explained germany -pipe- 22.11.2005 angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " so help me god " : chancellor angela merkel takes the oath of office angela merkel has been sworn in as germany 's head of government after parliamentarians elected her as the first female chancellor on tuesday . angela merkel was elected by a decisive margin , receiving 397 of the 611 valid parliamentary votes .
she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either .

volker neumann , the chairman of the bundestag 's secret service committee , told reporters that the german government must do everything in its power to prevent such incidents . " the government must publicly explain the details -lrb- of such cases -rrb- when it does n't betray secrets or endanger people , " said committee member hans-christian ströbele . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief hanning suggests more recent spying may have taken place the cases currently under observation by the committee date back to the early 1990s , but it was revealed earlier this month by bnd chief august hanning that more current examples of journalists coming under observation could not be ruled out .
hanning admitted that there was a possibility that reporters may have more recently been put under surveillance to identify " disloyal staff " behind leaks of sensitive information . secret questio n i n g ? the embarrassment of the public parliamentary criticism was exacerbated by an article published in the german news magazine der spiegel which reported bnd agents had secretly questioned a german national in a syrian jail for torture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zammar is allegedly being held at the far-filastin prison in damscus the report states that bnd and federal police officers traveled to syria in november 2002 to question mohammed haydar zammar in the far-filastin prison in damascus . zammar , a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 .
the report suggests that he was interrogated by the german agents over a period of three days after syrian authorities had broken down his resistance . it is alleged that the bnd was granted access to zammar after chancellor gerhard schröder 's office agreed to back down over the prosecution of two syrian-born spies .
a group that included syrian president bashar assad 's brother-in-law assef shawkat secretly visited berlin in july 2002 to arrange the deal . zammar family lawyer gül pinar is quoted in the report as saying that the german authorities had repeatedly told her and the suspect 's relatives that they had no idea where zammar was being held and that they had no way of contacting him .
pinar told der spiegel that if the reports of the bnd visit were true then the authorities " obviously lied . " " you ca n't say on the one hand ' we ca n't get to him and the syrian authorities are blocking everything ' , and then go in together with them and question him , " pinar , who is planning to file a legal complaint to establish if german officials had indeed interrogated zammar , told reuters . co n troversial priso n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's report states that 38 forms of torture are used at the facility far-filastin , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters , has a notorious reputation with human rights groups which claim to have documented evidence that it is a torture center .
amnesty international has documented 38 different torture methods , including electric shocks and beatings with wires , being used there . human rights groups say the united states and its western allies deny the use of torture by their own agents but are happy to use intelligence obtained under torture by third countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent allegations suggest the cia transports suspects to prisons via europe washington denies outsourcing torture but has acknowledged secretly moving suspects between countries to be interrogated in the " war on terrorism , " a process known as rendition . the bnd and federal police , as well as the german foreign ministry , have so far declined to comment on the magazine report . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence agency spied on journalists the head of germany 's foreign intelligence service confirmed on thursday that his agency spied on journalists in the 1990s .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .

but his boss claims the drug came from a treatment for baldness . at first , it seemed a bizarre claim and one designed solely to get 1860 munich 's serbia and montenegro forward nemanja vucicevic off the hook . vucicevic found himself at the center of a doping scandal in germany on monday after it was revealed he was being investigated by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- after giving a positive sample after the match with fellow second division club burghausen on nov .

leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .
vucicevic is not the first sportsman to be caught out by the drug .
argentina 's doubles tennis star mariano hood tested positive for finasteride at this year 's french open .
hood claims to have been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent his own hair loss .
the treatment was added to the atp tennis federation 's list of banned drugs last november as a masking agent . despite the fact that finasteride is a banned substance in many sports , anyone who used the treatment for more nefarious reasons would also know that its medical application could be used in their defense while taking it to cover up more sinister practices .
in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?
it would also have to go some way to beat that of us sprinter dennis mitchell who claimed that the banned hormone testosterone in his sample was the result of having sex four times and consuming five bottles of beer during the evening prior to a big race . however , finasteride would make for a strange choice of drug to take if performance enhancement was the ultimate goal .
finasteride comes with a number of side effects such as loss of libido , testicular pain , breast tenderness and enlargement - hardly the symptoms an active sportsman would want to take a chance with . so for now , the jury is out on what exactly is the bald truth in this case . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

as germany gets its first female chancellor , dw-world spoke to ciller about her experiences . tansu ciller was turkey 's first female prime minister , from 1993-1996 .
her election was seen as a signal to islamic fundamentalists and to the western world , as ciller was considered a symbol of modern turkey . dw-world : what effect did your election as prime minister have on turkey ? tansu ciller : i was a pioneer , but i had a lot of support - both from men and from women .
more than 80 percent voted for me .
it was important to show that ability counts - independent from gender .
turkey presented itself as a modern country . what problems were you confronted with ? as a woman in such a position , you face advantages as well as disadvantages .
but over time , you can show that professional qualifications are important .
and when that happens , at some point gender does n't play a role anymore .
leadership then takes the forefront . where do you see parallels to merkel 's situation ? mrs. merkel is also in the role of a pioneer .
like me , she , too , must try to unite and lead a coalition .
i also had to lead a coalition with social democrats and bring together different positions . what advice do you have for merkel ?
i would advise her to be thankful to the people for the election and to serve them - men and women - since , in the election , germany gave her its trust .
much has been said about merkel 's appearance .
her hairstyle and clothes were repeatedly the focus of attention .
did that happen to you , too ?
that is bound to happen .
people who are in the forefront and who are leaders in a society usually attract this kind of attention .
in time , it will be her decisions that will get the attention .
in time , it will be her leadership that will get the attention .
it 's the leadership that 's most important right now , and as leadership strengthens , the other agenda that is in the forefront right now will decrease in the attention of the people .
they will look at her as a leader who is making pretty good decisions for their lives .
you wanted turkey to become an eu member as soon as possible .
merkel prefers a " privileged partnership . "
how do you feel about that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tansu ciller it 's one thing , what you think as the opposition leader .
it 's another thing , what you need to do as a leader with a vision .
i think that the new chancellor will have to look at the world and at her own country with a vision for the future .
and when and if she does that , she will think otherwise . how is merkel perceived in turkey ? we are happy that germany is going through a stage that turkey already has gone through .
and we wish mrs. merkel all the success , because we feel that the people of germany are our close allies and friends .
and historically we 've always been very close to each other .
therefore we are hoping for leadership with a vision . what would you like to say to merkel ? i congratulate her and wish her the best .
i do hope that as a leader with a vision she will see the future and think of the advantages for her country - which i feel will benefit extremely from the eu membership of turkey . christine harjes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .

now , brewers are hoping a new generation of healthier , lighter beers will broaden the drink 's appeal , especially among women . “ beck ’ s beer … it quenches manly thirst , ” was the well-known advertising slogan for beck ’ s from the mid-1950s to the 1960s .
that chauvinistic tagline has since been replaced by the more inclusive , and urbane , english phrase “ welcome to the beck ’ s experience . ” but the earlier campaign may still be a truer reflection of the country ’ s drinking habits .
in germany , beer drinking is an overwhelmingly male pastime . image problem despite the ongoing love affair between germans and their national beverage - germany is the third largest beer-drinking nation in europe , behind the czech republic and ireland - the country has one of the lowest percentages of female beer drinkers in europe .
according to a 2004 report by international market-research group mintel , some 75 percent of german men , but only 29 percent of women , drink beer .
in spain and the uk , the percentage of women beer drinkers is close to 40 percent .
even italy , where beer is seen as a new and trendy alternative to wine , has a larger percentage of suds-sipping women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large mugs typically served at oktoberfest are n't very feminine “ beer has a bad image in germany among women , ” according to michael busemann , of the cologne agency for public relations . last spring , busemann created an ad campaign for the cologne-based beer brand gaffel kölsch , whose 1970s flowery motif seemed tailor-made for a female audience . “ if a woman wants to drink something special , she ’ ll order a champagne , or wine , " buseman said .
" the image of beer is that it makes you fat , or it ’ s associated with drunks .
it isn ’ t considered chic . " purity schmurity ? more than ever , breweries have reason to try and change that image .
domestic sales and consumption have been in steady decline since the 1990s - and women represent an obvious untapped market segment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brewers are now stressing beer 's healthy properties part of the problem has been the purity laws governing german brewing .
the laws hold that beverages labeled " beer " may only contain hops , malt , yeast and water .
while these rules protect the integrity of german beer , they have hamstrung brewers in terms of developing new flavors and styles of beer . but recent law suits over beers containing other ingredients , such as sugar , have shown that , with a little creative labeling , it 's possible to sidestep the purity laws . the breweries seem to have caught on .
sweeter tasting beers , beers lower in alcohol , and a new explosion of “ mixed beer drinks ” containing fruit juice or cola are storming the market .
references to “ manly thirst ” have been replaced with statistics touting beer ’ s healthy properties . riding the ' golden wave ' birte kleppien , spokesperson for the german brewers ’ association , refers to this “ very clear trend ” toward marketing beer to women as the “ golden wave . ”
becks gold started the movement , and was quickly followed by most of the other major breweries , she said .
suddenly shelves were filled with cheery-sounding brews like bitburger sun , krombacher extra mild , and karlsberg blondes , whose ad slogan actually referred to it as the “ beer for those who don ’ t really like beer . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck 's started the ' golden wave ' according to karl ullrich heyse , of brewing trade magazine brauwelt , these lighter brews have had “ outrageous success ” so far , but they are so new to the market that statistics are hard to come by . still , he cautions , breweries are unlikely to acknowledge that their beers are aimed specifically at women . “ you can ’ t offer women a product aimed only at women , because then they won ’ t want it , " heyse said . " pure women ’ s products aren ’ t very successful . ” smaller is better ? but kleppien of the brewers ’ association notes there are ways other than advertising to appeal to women .
for example , even in parts of germany where liter-size mugs are the norm , “ some bars are starting to offer beer in smaller glasses .
you can get 0.3 -lrb- liters -rrb- , 0.2 - even an aperitif glass .
it ’ s a small revolution , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hops contain antioxidants - now more than ever the new spate of “ wellness beers ” -lrb- mixed-beer drinks developed for an increasingly health-conscious public -rrb- offers the best chance for growth in the german beer industry – and they also appeal to women , kleppien said .
over 3,000 medical studies show the health properties of beer -lrb- it is rich in b vitamins , silica , magnesium and antioxidants -rrb- when it is consumed moderately . ' karla ' a success an antioxidant present in hops is thought to be useful in preventing cancer , heart attack , strokes and even alzheimer ’ s .
the weihenstephan brewery in bavaria recently found a way to concentrate the levels of this antioxidant , called xanthohumol , and is marketing its mixed-beer brew under the name xan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karla - sold in pharmacies , and aimed at middle-aged women germany ’ s karlsberg brewery is going a step further in marketing beer as a health drink .
it is market-testing a mixed-beer beverage called karla , and will sell the low-alcohol , tonic-like mix of beer and plant extracts , folic acids , vitamins , soy , biotin , and lecithin , in pharmacies . karlsberg pr representative marc kirch notes that so far in its test phase , karla is doing “ better than expected , ” and will likely go nationwide early next year . “ women over 40 most frequently patronize pharmacies - they tend to be a very health conscious group .
so we originally aimed it at them , ” kirch said .
but , he added , “ karla has done almost equally well among men , too . ” jennifer abramsohn , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in the land of beer a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .
as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide .

she needed at least 308 to take office . her own cdu party , its sister party the csu , and coalition partner spd together owned a total of 448 votes . a majority was virtually certain for 51-year-old merkel , who had spent the past weeks painstakingly crafting the current left-right " grand coalition " set to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder waves goodbye to supporters , preparing to leave office merkel is germany 's eighth post-world war ii leader . the first person to offer congratulations was former chancellor gerhard schröder , who started the whole election ball rolling half a year ago by calling snap elections . schröder will give up his seat in the bundestag on wednesday .
the 61-year-old plans to write his memoirs and practice law . movi n g ceremo n y visibly moved , merkel accepted the vote , and afterward went to nearby charlottenburg palace , where german president horst köhler presented the new chancellor - the first female and first eastern german to hold the office - with a certificate of appointment . " i feel good , and i am very content , and i am happy , " a glowing merkel told reporters afterward . she then returned to the bundestag , where she was formally sworn in , including the optional phrase : " so help me god . " later in the afternoon , the members of merkel 's cabinet also received their certificates of appointment from the president and took the oath of office in parliament . rough road ahead the relatively slim majority of votes for her chancellorship indicates that merkel 's government faces a difficult road in its task to turn around europe 's largest economy . merkel , a conservative , was forced into awkward compromises on taxes and welfare-state reforms that some fear could undermine her coalition with the left-wing social democrats , and slow efforts to fix a lagging economy . despite the fact that merkel failed to garner 51 of the votes available from her own coalition , social democrat parliamentary leader peter struck called the vote a " good beginning . " struck told zdf television that he was n't disappointed by the voting discrepancy . " any woman who can fight her way to the chancellorship of the -lrb- christian democratic -rrb- union has certain strengths , " struck said .
" she has the opportunity to become a good chancellor . " merkel 's chief-of-staff-elect , thomas de maiziere , acknowledged : " it was not a very good result , but it was n't a bad one either . " bildunterschrift : westerwelle cast doubts on the coalition 's strength - or is that just sour grapes ?
but guido westerwelle , chairman of the liberal opposition fdp party , warned the 51 ' nay ' votes were a sign of weakness of the newly elected coalition .
the fact that " several dozen " of the dissenting votes came from merkel 's own party showed " how unstable the foundation of this government is , " westerwelle told german public broadcaster ard . westerwelle 's fdp did not get enough seats in parliament to form the hoped-for right-wing coalition with merkel , thus forcing the right-left coalition that eventually won out . cha n cellor 's web site becomes female merkel 's election meanwhile has already resulted in a switch to the german head of government 's web site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.11.2005 conflicting evidence masks the bald facts in doping case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no denying he has a hair deficit nemanja vucicevic , striker for bundesliga team 1860 munich , failed a drugs test after a game earlier this month , soccer authorities revealed monday .
but his boss claims the drug came from a treatment for baldness . at first , it seemed a bizarre claim and one designed solely to get 1860 munich 's serbia and montenegro forward nemanja vucicevic off the hook . vucicevic found himself at the center of a doping scandal in germany on monday after it was revealed he was being investigated by the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- after giving a positive sample after the match with fellow second division club burghausen on nov .
4 .
leaping to his defense , managing director roland kneissl said the balding player had used a hair restorer which included banned substance finasteride in its ingredients . however , while investigators are looking into the claim that the follically-challenged vucicevic was in fact using a hair restorer and not taking finasteride to mask the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs , what ca n't be denied is the fact that kneissl 's wild claim actually has more than a hair 's breadth of credibility to it . banned substance a legitimate baldness treatment finasteride is a legitimate treatment for male baldness .
the drug works by inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone , the hormone which damages hair follicles causing hair loss in men who are genetically disposed to it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finasteride may be a medical treatment but it can still fail you a drugs test .
vucicevic is not the first sportsman to be caught out by the drug .
argentina 's doubles tennis star mariano hood tested positive for finasteride at this year 's french open .
hood claims to have been taking the substance for nine years in pill form to prevent his own hair loss .
the treatment was added to the atp tennis federation 's list of banned drugs last november as a masking agent . despite the fact that finasteride is a banned substance in many sports , anyone who used the treatment for more nefarious reasons would also know that its medical application could be used in their defense while taking it to cover up more sinister practices .
in the wrong hands , the dihydrotestosterone conversion process could also hide illegal levels of testosterone in the system . this lends credence to the initial thought that roland kneissl ’ s claim is one to rival some of the best in sport when it comes to explaining a failed drugs test . cia conspiracies and four times-a-night sex but it may not be up there with the likes of cuban high jumper javier sotomayor , who claimed his 1999 positive test for cocaine was the work of the cia , or australian cricketer shane warne 's assertion that the traces of a banned diuretic at the 2003 cricket world cup came from a treatment he was using to reduce the " puffiness " of his face . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could too much of this get you thrown out of the 100m sprint ?
it would also have to go some way to beat that of us sprinter dennis mitchell who claimed that the banned hormone testosterone in his sample was the result of having sex four times and consuming five bottles of beer during the evening prior to a big race . however , finasteride would make for a strange choice of drug to take if performance enhancement was the ultimate goal .
finasteride comes with a number of side effects such as loss of libido , testicular pain , breast tenderness and enlargement - hardly the symptoms an active sportsman would want to take a chance with . so for now , the jury is out on what exactly is the bald truth in this case . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : east germany 's doping legacy returns german athletics coach thomas springstein has been sacked by his club and faces criminal charges after an investigation found banned substances at his home .

the term " trial of the century " is something of a cliche and in the 20th century several dramatic court hearings could lay claim to the title .
but the trial of rose west at winchester crown court in the autumn of 1995 certainly lived up to its billing .
i covered the case as a reporter for rose west 's local evening newspaper , the gloucester citizen , and there is no doubt it was the biggest trial in the paper 's history .
from the beginning the outcome - that she would be found guilty - was never in doubt , certainly as far as we hacks were concerned .
but each day was packed full of drama and tension as the defence , led by the peerless richard ferguson qc , pulled out all the stops in an attempt to win an acquittal .
trials of the century 1945 : william joyce , known as lord haw haw , guilty of treason .
later executed .
1957 : gp john bodkin adams acquitted of killing two patients 1966 : moors murderers ian brady and myra hindley guilty 1969 : the kray brothers convicted 1979 : liberal leader jeremy thorpe acquitted of attempted murder 1981 : yorkshire ripper peter sutcliffe jailed 1995 : rose west given 10 life terms detective publishes west book watching foul murderess outside the court there was a huge media circus with satellite vans and journalists from all over the world .
the trial led the news bulletins on many evenings and every person who stepped into the witness box appeared to have some gem ready to impart .
many of them appeared only too well aware that what they said could end up as a soundbite .
i remember one particular day when one witness , kathryn halliday - a former lesbian lover of rose - was asked by counsel why she kept returning to 25 cromwell street when she was being abused by the couple .
" i was very , very low and vulnerable , " she said , " it 's like a moth to a flame .
the moth burns itself but it comes back until it really singes its wings and can fly no more . "
human drama moments later there was a break in proceedings and as the reporters dashed out to file their copy for the next day 's papers one hack muttered : " you could n't make this up " .
he was right .
the facts of the case and the human drama which unfolded in the court was far more gripping than any fiction ever dreamt up for tv and film .
one witness , janet leach , collapsed moments after giving evidence and another attempted suicide while waiting to testify .
ironically , the trial ran almost simultaneously with the oj simpson case in the us , which was televised .
goodness knows what sort of ratings the rose west trial would have got if they had allowed it to be shown on tv .
having said that much of the evidence was unsuitable for family newspapers or daytime tv , dealing as it did with child abuse of the most horrific kind and grisly details of some of the most disgusting murders ever committed in this country .
many was the friday night when i returned to gloucester to be asked by my colleagues for the details which the paper had been unable to print .
as the weeks went on and the evidence against rose piled up she became more and more desperate .
it is widely thought - although mr ferguson refuses to discuss it even now , due to client confidentiality - that he advised her not to give evidence on her own behalf but she overruled him .
whatever happened to ... ?
the defendant : rose west is in hmp bronzefield and has been told she will never be freed the judge : mr justice mantell retired last year the prosecutor : brian leveson qc is now a judge and is currently in charge of the anthony walker trial in liverpool the defence counsel : richard ferguson qc is still going strong at the age of 70 and has no plans to retire .
the detective : detective superintendent john bennett retired in 1998 .
he has just published a book on the case .
in the event he was proved right as she was a disaster in the witness box .
the jury were given an insight into her petty , spiteful character and when she lost her temper and showed flashes of anger , under cross-examination by prosecutor brian leveson qc , you could almost see the jurors making a mental note .
when the verdicts finally came in she remained as impassive as ever .
sentencing her , the judge , mr justice mantell , said : " if any attention is paid to what i think , you will never be released .
take her down . "
she was taken to the cells and the media circus rolled into action .
rose west is currently languishing in a cell in a new prison , bronzefield , near ashford , middlesex .
she remains in denial and shows no signs of ever admitting to her heinous crimes .
whether she will , like myra hindley , gradually open up and admit to her role remains to be seen .

rose west has been told she will never be released the term " trial of the century " is something of a cliche and in the 20th century several dramatic court hearings could lay claim to the title .
but the trial of rose west at winchester crown court in the autumn of 1995 certainly lived up to its billing .
i covered the case as a reporter for rose west 's local evening newspaper , the gloucester citizen , and there is no doubt it was the biggest trial in the paper 's history .
from the beginning the outcome - that she would be found guilty - was never in doubt , certainly as far as we hacks were concerned .
but each day was packed full of drama and tension as the defence , led by the peerless richard ferguson qc , pulled out all the stops in an attempt to win an acquittal .
trials of the century 1945 : william joyce , known as lord haw haw , guilty of treason .
later executed .
1957 : gp john bodkin adams acquitted of killing two patients 1966 : moors murderers ian brady and myra hindley guilty 1969 : the kray brothers convicted 1979 : liberal leader jeremy thorpe acquitted of attempted murder 1981 : yorkshire ripper peter sutcliffe jailed 1995 : rose west given 10 life terms detective publishes west book watching foul murderess outside the court there was a huge media circus with satellite vans and journalists from all over the world .
the trial led the news bulletins on many evenings and every person who stepped into the witness box appeared to have some gem ready to impart .
many of them appeared only too well aware that what they said could end up as a soundbite .
i remember one particular day when one witness , kathryn halliday - a former lesbian lover of rose - was asked by counsel why she kept returning to 25 cromwell street when she was being abused by the couple .
" i was very , very low and vulnerable , " she said , " it 's like a moth to a flame .
the moth burns itself but it comes back until it really singes its wings and can fly no more . "
human drama moments later there was a break in proceedings and as the reporters dashed out to file their copy for the next day 's papers one hack muttered : " you could n't make this up " .
he was right .
the facts of the case and the human drama which unfolded in the court was far more gripping than any fiction ever dreamt up for tv and film .
one witness , janet leach , collapsed moments after giving evidence and another attempted suicide while waiting to testify .
ironically , the trial ran almost simultaneously with the oj simpson case in the us , which was televised .
goodness knows what sort of ratings the rose west trial would have got if they had allowed it to be shown on tv .
25 cromwell street was completely erased by the local council having said that much of the evidence was unsuitable for family newspapers or daytime tv , dealing as it did with child abuse of the most horrific kind and grisly details of some of the most disgusting murders ever committed in this country .
many was the friday night when i returned to gloucester to be asked by my colleagues for the details which the paper had been unable to print .
as the weeks went on and the evidence against rose piled up she became more and more desperate .
it is widely thought - although mr ferguson refuses to discuss it even now , due to client confidentiality - that he advised her not to give evidence on her own behalf but she overruled him .
whatever happened to ... ?
the defendant : rose west is in hmp bronzefield and has been told she will never be freed the judge : mr justice mantell retired last year the prosecutor : brian leveson qc is now a judge and is currently in charge of the anthony walker trial in liverpool the defence counsel : richard ferguson qc is still going strong at the age of 70 and has no plans to retire .
the detective : detective superintendent john bennett retired in 1998 .
he has just published a book on the case .
in the event he was proved right as she was a disaster in the witness box .
the jury were given an insight into her petty , spiteful character and when she lost her temper and showed flashes of anger , under cross-examination by prosecutor brian leveson qc , you could almost see the jurors making a mental note .
when the verdicts finally came in she remained as impassive as ever .
sentencing her , the judge , mr justice mantell , said : " if any attention is paid to what i think , you will never be released .
take her down . "
she was taken to the cells and the media circus rolled into action .
rose west is currently languishing in a cell in a new prison , bronzefield , near ashford , middlesex .
she remains in denial and shows no signs of ever admitting to her heinous crimes .
whether she will , like myra hindley , gradually open up and admit to her role remains to be seen .

rose west has been told she will never be released the term " trial of the century " is something of a cliche and in the 20th century several dramatic court hearings could lay claim to the title .
but the trial of rose west at winchester crown court in the autumn of 1995 certainly lived up to its billing .
i covered the case as a reporter for rose west 's local evening newspaper , the gloucester citizen , and there is no doubt it was the biggest trial in the paper 's history .
from the beginning the outcome - that she would be found guilty - was never in doubt , certainly as far as we hacks were concerned .
but each day was packed full of drama and tension as the defence , led by the peerless richard ferguson qc , pulled out all the stops in an attempt to win an acquittal .
trials of the century 1945 : william joyce , known as lord haw haw , guilty of treason .
later executed .
1957 : gp john bodkin adams acquitted of killing two patients 1966 : moors murderers ian brady and myra hindley guilty 1969 : the kray brothers convicted 1979 : liberal leader jeremy thorpe acquitted of attempted murder 1981 : yorkshire ripper peter sutcliffe jailed 1995 : rose west given 10 life terms detective publishes west book watching foul murderess outside the court there was a huge media circus with satellite vans and journalists from all over the world .
the trial led the news bulletins on many evenings and every person who stepped into the witness box appeared to have some gem ready to impart .
many of them appeared only too well aware that what they said could end up as a soundbite .
i remember one particular day when one witness , kathryn halliday - a former lesbian lover of rose - was asked by counsel why she kept returning to 25 cromwell street when she was being abused by the couple .
" i was very , very low and vulnerable , " she said , " it 's like a moth to a flame .
the moth burns itself but it comes back until it really singes its wings and can fly no more . "
human drama moments later there was a break in proceedings and as the reporters dashed out to file their copy for the next day 's papers one hack muttered : " you could n't make this up " .
he was right .
the facts of the case and the human drama which unfolded in the court was far more gripping than any fiction ever dreamt up for tv and film .
one witness , janet leach , collapsed moments after giving evidence and another attempted suicide while waiting to testify .
ironically , the trial ran almost simultaneously with the oj simpson case in the us , which was televised .
goodness knows what sort of ratings the rose west trial would have got if they had allowed it to be shown on tv .
25 cromwell street was completely erased by the local council having said that much of the evidence was unsuitable for family newspapers or daytime tv , dealing as it did with child abuse of the most horrific kind and grisly details of some of the most disgusting murders ever committed in this country .
many was the friday night when i returned to gloucester to be asked by my colleagues for the details which the paper had been unable to print .
as the weeks went on and the evidence against rose piled up she became more and more desperate .
it is widely thought - although mr ferguson refuses to discuss it even now , due to client confidentiality - that he advised her not to give evidence on her own behalf but she overruled him .
whatever happened to ... ?
the defendant : rose west is in hmp bronzefield and has been told she will never be freed the judge : mr justice mantell retired last year the prosecutor : brian leveson qc is now a judge and is currently in charge of the anthony walker trial in liverpool the defence counsel : richard ferguson qc is still going strong at the age of 70 and has no plans to retire .
the detective : detective superintendent john bennett retired in 1998 .
he has just published a book on the case .
in the event he was proved right as she was a disaster in the witness box .
the jury were given an insight into her petty , spiteful character and when she lost her temper and showed flashes of anger , under cross-examination by prosecutor brian leveson qc , you could almost see the jurors making a mental note .
when the verdicts finally came in she remained as impassive as ever .
sentencing her , the judge , mr justice mantell , said : " if any attention is paid to what i think , you will never be released .
take her down . "
she was taken to the cells and the media circus rolled into action .
rose west is currently languishing in a cell in a new prison , bronzefield , near ashford , middlesex .
she remains in denial and shows no signs of ever admitting to her heinous crimes .
whether she will , like myra hindley , gradually open up and admit to her role remains to be seen .

rose west has been told she will never be released the term " trial of the century " is something of a cliche and in the 20th century several dramatic court hearings could lay claim to the title .
but the trial of rose west at winchester crown court in the autumn of 1995 certainly lived up to its billing .
i covered the case as a reporter for rose west 's local evening newspaper , the gloucester citizen , and there is no doubt it was the biggest trial in the paper 's history .
from the beginning the outcome - that she would be found guilty - was never in doubt , certainly as far as we hacks were concerned .
but each day was packed full of drama and tension as the defence , led by the peerless richard ferguson qc , pulled out all the stops in an attempt to win an acquittal .
trials of the century 1945 : william joyce , known as lord haw haw , guilty of treason .
later executed .
1957 : gp john bodkin adams acquitted of killing two patients 1966 : moors murderers ian brady and myra hindley guilty 1969 : the kray brothers convicted 1979 : liberal leader jeremy thorpe acquitted of attempted murder 1981 : yorkshire ripper peter sutcliffe jailed 1995 : rose west given 10 life terms detective publishes west book watching foul murderess outside the court there was a huge media circus with satellite vans and journalists from all over the world .
the trial led the news bulletins on many evenings and every person who stepped into the witness box appeared to have some gem ready to impart .
many of them appeared only too well aware that what they said could end up as a soundbite .
i remember one particular day when one witness , kathryn halliday - a former lesbian lover of rose - was asked by counsel why she kept returning to 25 cromwell street when she was being abused by the couple .
" i was very , very low and vulnerable , " she said , " it 's like a moth to a flame .
the moth burns itself but it comes back until it really singes its wings and can fly no more . "
human drama moments later there was a break in proceedings and as the reporters dashed out to file their copy for the next day 's papers one hack muttered : " you could n't make this up " .
he was right .
the facts of the case and the human drama which unfolded in the court was far more gripping than any fiction ever dreamt up for tv and film .
one witness , janet leach , collapsed moments after giving evidence and another attempted suicide while waiting to testify .
ironically , the trial ran almost simultaneously with the oj simpson case in the us , which was televised .
goodness knows what sort of ratings the rose west trial would have got if they had allowed it to be shown on tv .
25 cromwell street was completely erased by the local council having said that much of the evidence was unsuitable for family newspapers or daytime tv , dealing as it did with child abuse of the most horrific kind and grisly details of some of the most disgusting murders ever committed in this country .
many was the friday night when i returned to gloucester to be asked by my colleagues for the details which the paper had been unable to print .
as the weeks went on and the evidence against rose piled up she became more and more desperate .
it is widely thought - although mr ferguson refuses to discuss it even now , due to client confidentiality - that he advised her not to give evidence on her own behalf but she overruled him .
whatever happened to ... ?
the defendant : rose west is in hmp bronzefield and has been told she will never be freed the judge : mr justice mantell retired last year the prosecutor : brian leveson qc is now a judge and is currently in charge of the anthony walker trial in liverpool the defence counsel : richard ferguson qc is still going strong at the age of 70 and has no plans to retire .
the detective : detective superintendent john bennett retired in 1998 .
he has just published a book on the case .
in the event he was proved right as she was a disaster in the witness box .
the jury were given an insight into her petty , spiteful character and when she lost her temper and showed flashes of anger , under cross-examination by prosecutor brian leveson qc , you could almost see the jurors making a mental note .
when the verdicts finally came in she remained as impassive as ever .
sentencing her , the judge , mr justice mantell , said : " if any attention is paid to what i think , you will never be released .
take her down . "
she was taken to the cells and the media circus rolled into action .
rose west is currently languishing in a cell in a new prison , bronzefield , near ashford , middlesex .
she remains in denial and shows no signs of ever admitting to her heinous crimes .
whether she will , like myra hindley , gradually open up and admit to her role remains to be seen .

here , bbc news reporter jackie storer reveals what it was like to cover the " trial of the century " .
fred west murdered his daughter heather in cromwell street for seven harrowing weeks my colleagues on the press benches and i sat and listened to the most incredible story of depravity , sexual obsession and sheer evil .
none of us had an inkling about how bad it was going to be and how much these poor girls suffered .
most were abducted from the streets , tortured , bound with gags or masking tape , sexually assaulted , murdered and cut up .
one could only imagine how desperate their last moments on this earth must have been .
west suicide even in death , rose west and her husband fred could not afford their victims the dignity of a proper burial .
instead the bodies were dismembered and stuffed into vertical holes in the ground .
his thick west country accent evident , and speaking in the most matter-of-fact way , this cheerful little man described how he murdered and cut up their own daughter heather cps : link href = " " id = " 4440128 " style = " rightarrow " > detective publishes west book memories of ' trial of century ' despite the fact that this was a joint venture , the jury did not have the chance to try fred west - the undoubted perpetrator of two more murders than the 10 rose was accused of .
he escaped justice by strangling himself in his cell at birmingham 's winson green prison , 10 months before the trial was due to begin at winchester crown court .
however , his ghost was ever present in the courtroom .
one of the most chilling testimonies i remember was from fred himself .
unbelievable in one of the many moments of high drama during the trial , a tape recording of his interview with police was played to the jury .
his thick west country accent evident , and speaking in the most matter-of-fact way , this cheerful-sounding little man described how he murdered and cut up their own daughter heather .
rose west was so ordinary looking he said she had wanted to leave home , he lunged at her , strangled her and chopped her up with an ice saw .
he finally buried her body under the patio .
according to him , rose was out shopping at the time .
i remember rushing out to file his exact words for one of the afternoon editions of my paper .
reading them back from my notebook to my colleague , who was copy-taking , it was impossible to believe this was a father talking about his daughter .
another big moment came when a photo of a grinning eight-year-old , charmaine west - the daughter of fred 's first wife rena costello -lrb- another victim -rrb- - was beamed on to the courtroom wall .
over it was placed a skull found at the wests ' former home at 25 midland road , gloucester .
there was an audible intake of breath when it was clear the two were an exact match .
' small house ' there were lots of times when i remember thinking : " there ca n't be anything else , i have heard the most evil things i am ever going to hear . "
but there would be .
one of the most powerful witnesses to take the stand was fred 's daughter anne-marie west .
she told how she was raped by her father and sexually abused by her step-mother rose .
personally i still can not believe one human could inflict such pain , terror and abuse on another hearing detail like that made you look and wonder at the ordinariness of rose west .
she dressed soberly - from what i can remember - usually in a black jacket and with dangly gold earrings .
she could have been anyone you might casually pass in the street .
yet every day she and her husband stomached living in a house where they had tortured , murdered and buried their victims .
even their home - the infamous 25 cromwell street - came as a bit of a surprise to me .
it was just a small , nondescript end-of-terrace house .
sanitised copy yet during the trial much was made of all the lodgers that stayed there and the comings and goings of rose 's " clients " .
a small hotel was more what i had in mind .
so did the trial affect me ?
that is a difficult one to answer .
reporters were offered counselling during and after those seven weeks , but the only ones who showed any interest ended up doing a story on the fact hacks had n't taken it up .
rose west killed her eight-year-old stepdaughter charmaine there were of course many things i heard during the case that my paper , in line with most respectable media outlets , never repeated because they were too horrible .
i would not have liked an adult , let alone a young child , to read some of the things i heard .
keeping mum personally i still can not believe one human could inflict such pain , terror and abuse on another .
how could a parent kill their own flesh and blood ?
how come no-one staying in the house ever suspected what was going on ?
and for the victims ' families - how do you ever get over what has happened to your loved one ?
i came away from the experience with a lot more questions than answers - and i had only dipped into this tale for the trial .
the only person who can give us the facts is rose west .
but she is locked up for life with no obvious chance of release .
in her mind she has nothing to gain by talking .

here , bbc news reporter jackie storer reveals what it was like to cover the " trial of the century " .
fred west murdered his daughter heather in cromwell street for seven harrowing weeks my colleagues on the press benches and i sat and listened to the most incredible story of depravity , sexual obsession and sheer evil .
none of us had an inkling about how bad it was going to be and how much these poor girls suffered .
most were abducted from the streets , tortured , bound with gags or masking tape , sexually assaulted , murdered and cut up .
one could only imagine how desperate their last moments on this earth must have been .
west suicide even in death , rose west and her husband fred could not afford their victims the dignity of a proper burial .
instead the bodies were dismembered and stuffed into vertical holes in the ground .
his thick west country accent evident , and speaking in the most matter-of-fact way , this cheerful little man described how he murdered and cut up their own daughter heather cps : link href = " " id = " 4440128 " style = " rightarrow " > detective publishes west book memories of ' trial of century ' despite the fact that this was a joint venture , the jury did not have the chance to try fred west - the undoubted perpetrator of two more murders than the 10 rose was accused of .
he escaped justice by strangling himself in his cell at birmingham 's winson green prison , 10 months before the trial was due to begin at winchester crown court .
however , his ghost was ever present in the courtroom .
one of the most chilling testimonies i remember was from fred himself .
unbelievable in one of the many moments of high drama during the trial , a tape recording of his interview with police was played to the jury .
his thick west country accent evident , and speaking in the most matter-of-fact way , this cheerful-sounding little man described how he murdered and cut up their own daughter heather .
rose west was so ordinary looking he said she had wanted to leave home , he lunged at her , strangled her and chopped her up with an ice saw .
he finally buried her body under the patio .
according to him , rose was out shopping at the time .
i remember rushing out to file his exact words for one of the afternoon editions of my paper .
reading them back from my notebook to my colleague , who was copy-taking , it was impossible to believe this was a father talking about his daughter .
another big moment came when a photo of a grinning eight-year-old , charmaine west - the daughter of fred 's first wife rena costello -lrb- another victim -rrb- - was beamed on to the courtroom wall .
over it was placed a skull found at the wests ' former home at 25 midland road , gloucester .
there was an audible intake of breath when it was clear the two were an exact match .
' small house ' there were lots of times when i remember thinking : " there ca n't be anything else , i have heard the most evil things i am ever going to hear . "
but there would be .
one of the most powerful witnesses to take the stand was fred 's daughter anne-marie west .
she told how she was raped by her father and sexually abused by her step-mother rose .
personally i still can not believe one human could inflict such pain , terror and abuse on another hearing detail like that made you look and wonder at the ordinariness of rose west .
she dressed soberly - from what i can remember - usually in a black jacket and with dangly gold earrings .
she could have been anyone you might casually pass in the street .
yet every day she and her husband stomached living in a house where they had tortured , murdered and buried their victims .
even their home - the infamous 25 cromwell street - came as a bit of a surprise to me .
it was just a small , nondescript end-of-terrace house .
sanitised copy yet during the trial much was made of all the lodgers that stayed there and the comings and goings of rose 's " clients " .
a small hotel was more what i had in mind .
so did the trial affect me ?
that is a difficult one to answer .
reporters were offered counselling during and after those seven weeks , but the only ones who showed any interest ended up doing a story on the fact hacks had n't taken it up .
rose west killed her eight-year-old stepdaughter charmaine there were of course many things i heard during the case that my paper , in line with most respectable media outlets , never repeated because they were too horrible .
i would not have liked an adult , let alone a young child , to read some of the things i heard .
keeping mum personally i still can not believe one human could inflict such pain , terror and abuse on another .

rose west was so ordinary looking he said she had wanted to leave home , he lunged at her , strangled her and chopped her up with an ice saw .
he finally buried her body under the patio .
according to him , rose was out shopping at the time .
i remember rushing out to file his exact words for one of the afternoon editions of my paper .
reading them back from my notebook to my colleague , who was copy-taking , it was impossible to believe this was a father talking about his daughter .
another big moment came when a photo of a grinning eight-year-old , charmaine west - the daughter of fred 's first wife rena costello -lrb- another victim -rrb- - was beamed on to the courtroom wall .
over it was placed a skull found at the wests ' former home at 25 midland road , gloucester .
there was an audible intake of breath when it was clear the two were an exact match .

one of the most powerful witnesses to take the stand was fred 's daughter anne-marie west .
she told how she was raped by her father and sexually abused by her step-mother rose .
personally i still can not believe one human could inflict such pain , terror and abuse on another hearing detail like that made you look and wonder at the ordinariness of rose west .
she dressed soberly - from what i can remember - usually in a black jacket and with dangly gold earrings .
she could have been anyone you might casually pass in the street .
yet every day she and her husband stomached living in a house where they had tortured , murdered and buried their victims .
even their home - the infamous 25 cromwell street - came as a bit of a surprise to me .
it was just a small , nondescript end-of-terrace house .
sanitised copy yet during the trial much was made of all the lodgers that stayed there and the comings and goings of rose 's " clients " .
a small hotel was more what i had in mind .
so did the trial affect me ?
that is a difficult one to answer .

rose west killed her eight-year-old stepdaughter charmaine there were of course many things i heard during the case that my paper , in line with most respectable media outlets , never repeated because they were too horrible .
i would not have liked an adult , let alone a young child , to read some of the things i heard .
keeping mum personally i still can not believe one human could inflict such pain , terror and abuse on another .
how could a parent kill their own flesh and blood ?
how come no-one staying in the house ever suspected what was going on ?
and for the victims ' families - how do you ever get over what has happened to your loved one ?

the news of former detective superintendent john bennett 's book comes on the 10th anniversary of rose west being jailed for life .
on 22 november 1995 she was given 10 life terms at winchester crown court .
the discovery of bodies at the wests ' house in cromwell street , gloucester , shocked the nation .
fred west suffocated himself while on remand but his wife was convicted and has been told she will never be freed .
she is now in bronzefield , a brand new prison near ashford , middlesex .
mr bennett always vowed he would never write a book about the case .
but after years of being quizzed about the truth , the myths and the stories around the murders , he has finally relented .
house of horrors case feb 1994 : police begin digging up garden of 25 cromwell street , gloucester .
1 jan 1995 : fred west hangs himself while on remand in winson green jail , birmingham .
oct 1995 : rose west goes on trial at winchester crown court accused of 10 murders , including that of her daughter heather 22 nov 1995 : rose west is given 10 life sentences .
home secretary later decides she will never be freed from jail .
the trial of the century watching foul murderess " the cromwell street murders - the detective 's story " is mr bennett 's attempt to give the answers to the questions that have plagued him over the last decade .
he says that on every anniversary - this week it is 10 years since rose west was jailed - reporters , authors , film and documentary-makers always seek him out for a comment .
" i have had reporters and people writing books who have phoned me and raised a matter and i have said that is n't true , but they have said they have read so-and-so .
" as this went on i realised it was time to draw the line - why should i keep being asked these questions year in , year out ?
" i also genuinely realised there was no definitive account of this police investigation .
" the reporters speculated , surmised , added their own pieces in to make the story read the way they thought it should read .
" the involvement of the agencies , especially social services and witness support , the proper organisations that made this thing work got lost in what was the horror of it all .
" it seemed to me whichever way i looked at it , this was unfortunately a historic thing too and it seemed right that if that was the case , somebody ought to write it properly . "
folklore and so two years ago mr bennett , 60 - a man more used to filling in police reports - sat down and began to write .
after five or six chapters he reviewed his work and realised he had been talking in the third person .
what he needed to do was personalise the piece . "
why it is still being brought up is because it is so hard to come to terms with " john bennett " i 'm not an ' i ' person because there is no ' i ' in team .
i found it very difficult saying ' when i did this and when i did that ' .
it was always a team effort , " he said .
he says the book is not about financial gain - he has even used a local firm in stroud to publish it .
but it is about dispelling some of the folklore that has built up around the wests - like stories that fred had an incestuous relationship with his mother .
" there is n't anybody alive who has ever said that , " said mr bennett , who retired from gloucestershire police in 1998 .
" i have explained how the case really started , how the identification process took place , the involvement of the agencies , all the ups and downs , twists and turns and on to the appeal , " he said .
" i have tried to answer the major questions .
it is n't a book about fred and rose west .
if people want to speculate , see their history , their background and detail , they can go elsewhere . "
sadness so what had the biggest effect on him during the investigation and the trial ? "
i have yet to see any emotion from that woman at all - there were no tears " john bennett " genuinely what hit me at the time and it 's not something i reflect on , is the true sadness of it all , " he said .
" why it is still being brought up is because it is so hard to come to terms with .
" that those two could do the things that they did and live in the home that they lived in with nine victims underneath them , including their first daughter , and live - to their neighbours and those that they came into contact outside their depraved world of sex - a normal life and be the type of people that were considered to be a family unit .
" whichever way you look at it , there is an air of disbelief .
" you know that it happened , you know as a police officer you should n't think that anything is unusual really , but to try to make sense of that is difficult . "
' in denial ' the married father and grandfather says he could not have written the book without the support of the gloucestershire force , or its chief constable timothy brain . "
i would hope that she would feel it right to cleanse herself of what she 's done and face it , but then i 'm thinking she would want inner peace " john bennett he says he has not spoken to the victims ' families about it .
he is also doubtful that rose west will ever give up the innermost secrets of cromwell street .
" she has maintained this being in denial from the beginning , " he said .
" it 's been made clear that she 's not going to be released - of course that could change - but if she was , where would she go ?
" i have yet to see any emotion from that woman at all .
i was close to where she was at the trial - there were no tears .
" she might have wanted there to be , but they did n't come .
but then , that does n't surprise me .
" i would hope that she would feel it right to cleanse herself of what she 's done and face it , but then i 'm thinking she would want inner peace .
" she has n't accepted perhaps the horror of it herself . "

he says that on every anniversary - this week it is 10 years since rose west was jailed - reporters , authors , film and documentary-makers always seek him out for a comment .
" i have had reporters and people writing books who have phoned me and raised a matter and i have said that is n't true , but they have said they have read so-and-so .
" as this went on i realised it was time to draw the line - why should i keep being asked these questions year in , year out ?
" i also genuinely realised there was no definitive account of this police investigation .
mr bennett was awarded the queen 's police medal for his work " the reporters speculated , surmised , added their own pieces in to make the story read the way they thought it should read .
" the involvement of the agencies , especially social services and witness support , the proper organisations that made this thing work got lost in what was the horror of it all .
" it seemed to me whichever way i looked at it , this was unfortunately a historic thing too and it seemed right that if that was the case , somebody ought to write it properly . "
folklore and so two years ago mr bennett , 60 - a man more used to filling in police reports - sat down and began to write .
after five or six chapters he reviewed his work and realised he had been talking in the third person .
what he needed to do was personalise the piece .
why it is still being brought up is because it is so hard to come to terms with john bennett " i 'm not an ' i ' person because there is no ' i ' in team .
i found it very difficult saying ' when i did this and when i did that ' .
it was always a team effort , " he said .
he says the book is not about financial gain - he has even used a local firm in stroud to publish it .
but it is about dispelling some of the folklore that has built up around the wests - like stories that fred had an incestuous relationship with his mother .
" there is n't anybody alive who has ever said that , " said mr bennett , who retired from gloucestershire police in 1998 .
" i have explained how the case really started , how the identification process took place , the involvement of the agencies , all the ups and downs , twists and turns and on to the appeal , " he said .
" i have tried to answer the major questions .
it is n't a book about fred and rose west .
if people want to speculate , see their history , their background and detail , they can go elsewhere . "
sadness so what had the biggest effect on him during the investigation and the trial ?
i have yet to see any emotion from that woman at all - there were no tears john bennett " genuinely what hit me at the time and it 's not something i reflect on , is the true sadness of it all , " he said .
" why it is still being brought up is because it is so hard to come to terms with .
" that those two could do the things that they did and live in the home that they lived in with nine victims underneath them , including their first daughter , and live - to their neighbours and those that they came into contact outside their depraved world of sex - a normal life and be the type of people that were considered to be a family unit .
" whichever way you look at it , there is an air of disbelief .
" you know that it happened , you know as a police officer you should n't think that anything is unusual really , but to try to make sense of that is difficult . "
' in denial ' the married father and grandfather says he could not have written the book without the support of the gloucestershire force , or its chief constable timothy brain .
i would hope that she would feel it right to cleanse herself of what she 's done and face it , but then i 'm thinking she would want inner peace john bennett he says he has not spoken to the victims ' families about it .
he is also doubtful that rose west will ever give up the innermost secrets of cromwell street .
" she has maintained this being in denial from the beginning , " he said .
" it 's been made clear that she 's not going to be released - of course that could change - but if she was , where would she go ?
" i have yet to see any emotion from that woman at all .
i was close to where she was at the trial - there were no tears .
" she might have wanted there to be , but they did n't come .
but then , that does n't surprise me .
" i would hope that she would feel it right to cleanse herself of what she 's done and face it , but then i 'm thinking she would want inner peace .
" she has n't accepted perhaps the horror of it herself . "

the news of former detective superintendent john bennett 's book comes on the 10th anniversary of rose west being jailed for life .
on 22 november 1995 she was given 10 life terms at winchester crown court .
the discovery of bodies at the wests ' house in cromwell street , gloucester , shocked the nation .
fred west suffocated himself while on remand but his wife was convicted and has been told she will never be freed .
she is now in bronzefield , a brand new prison near ashford , middlesex .
mr bennett always vowed he would never write a book about the case .
but after years of being quizzed about the truth , the myths and the stories around the murders , he has finally relented .
house of horrors case feb 1994 : police begin digging up garden of 25 cromwell street , gloucester .
1 jan 1995 : fred west hangs himself while on remand in winson green jail , birmingham .
oct 1995 : rose west goes on trial at winchester crown court accused of 10 murders , including that of her daughter heather 22 nov 1995 : rose west is given 10 life sentences .
home secretary later decides she will never be freed from jail .
the trial of the century watching foul murderess " the cromwell street murders - the detective 's story " is mr bennett 's attempt to give the answers to the questions that have plagued him over the last decade .
he says that on every anniversary - this week it is 10 years since rose west was jailed - reporters , authors , film and documentary-makers always seek him out for a comment .
" i have had reporters and people writing books who have phoned me and raised a matter and i have said that is n't true , but they have said they have read so-and-so .
" as this went on i realised it was time to draw the line - why should i keep being asked these questions year in , year out ?
" i also genuinely realised there was no definitive account of this police investigation .
mr bennett was awarded the queen 's police medal for his work " the reporters speculated , surmised , added their own pieces in to make the story read the way they thought it should read .
" the involvement of the agencies , especially social services and witness support , the proper organisations that made this thing work got lost in what was the horror of it all .
" it seemed to me whichever way i looked at it , this was unfortunately a historic thing too and it seemed right that if that was the case , somebody ought to write it properly . "
folklore and so two years ago mr bennett , 60 - a man more used to filling in police reports - sat down and began to write .
after five or six chapters he reviewed his work and realised he had been talking in the third person .
what he needed to do was personalise the piece .
why it is still being brought up is because it is so hard to come to terms with john bennett " i 'm not an ' i ' person because there is no ' i ' in team .
i found it very difficult saying ' when i did this and when i did that ' .
it was always a team effort , " he said .
he says the book is not about financial gain - he has even used a local firm in stroud to publish it .
but it is about dispelling some of the folklore that has built up around the wests - like stories that fred had an incestuous relationship with his mother .
" there is n't anybody alive who has ever said that , " said mr bennett , who retired from gloucestershire police in 1998 .
" i have explained how the case really started , how the identification process took place , the involvement of the agencies , all the ups and downs , twists and turns and on to the appeal , " he said .
" i have tried to answer the major questions .
it is n't a book about fred and rose west .
if people want to speculate , see their history , their background and detail , they can go elsewhere . "
sadness so what had the biggest effect on him during the investigation and the trial ?
i have yet to see any emotion from that woman at all - there were no tears john bennett " genuinely what hit me at the time and it 's not something i reflect on , is the true sadness of it all , " he said .
" why it is still being brought up is because it is so hard to come to terms with .
" that those two could do the things that they did and live in the home that they lived in with nine victims underneath them , including their first daughter , and live - to their neighbours and those that they came into contact outside their depraved world of sex - a normal life and be the type of people that were considered to be a family unit .
" whichever way you look at it , there is an air of disbelief .
" you know that it happened , you know as a police officer you should n't think that anything is unusual really , but to try to make sense of that is difficult . "
' in denial ' the married father and grandfather says he could not have written the book without the support of the gloucestershire force , or its chief constable timothy brain .
i would hope that she would feel it right to cleanse herself of what she 's done and face it , but then i 'm thinking she would want inner peace john bennett he says he has not spoken to the victims ' families about it .
he is also doubtful that rose west will ever give up the innermost secrets of cromwell street .

representatives from the eu , us , brazil and india will hold talks ahead of december 's full gathering of the wto .
the talks in hong kong are unlikely to achieve what the big countries want - the full outline of a deal to make major inroads into barriers to trade .
but they still hope to get that outline drawn up in the next few months .
the big countries have not abandoned the hope that they will have the full , detailed agreement by the end of next year .
farm tariffs the current obstacles are in the negotiations to cut tariffs - taxes that are applied only to imported goods .
on agricultural tariffs , the eu is under pressure to go further than the cuts it has already offered .
but europe wants many of the developing countries to cut their tariffs on imports of industrial goods by more than they have proposed so far .
the eu 's chief negotiator , peter mandelson , has suggested that the eu could table a new offer on farm tariffs .
but he made it clear that it was unlikely to come before the hong kong meeting .
he also made it clear that he wanted to see progress in other areas .
if the eu is unwilling to move further at this stage on farm tariffs , it seems unlikely that the geneva meeting can produce decisive progress .
