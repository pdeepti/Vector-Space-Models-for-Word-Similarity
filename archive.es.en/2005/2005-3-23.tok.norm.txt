the police were alerted to the situation after neighbors complained of a strong smell of excrement coming from the apartment in hanover .
when the tenant opened her door to the police on saturday , they were greeted by a swarm of flies .
inside the apartment police officers found cages containing guinea pigs , rabbits and parrots , and the floors were covered in faeces .
one of the rooms , which was originally the little girl 's , was inhabited by rats .
" my colleagues did n't open the door to the second room because the rats would have come running out , " said police spokeswoman petra holzhausen , adding that veterinary specialists were currently eradicating the rodents from the apartment .
holzhausen said the woman had clearly lost control of the situation .
" in the beginning she just kept a few rats , but they bred out of control . "
the woman admitted to continuing to feed the rodents over the last six months . dw-world.de fat cat relocates to berlin some are calling it animal cruelty , others are calling it an application of the atkins diet .

" we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .
along with paris , berlin has been a strong backer of ending the ban with its own lucrative trade agreements with the people 's republic a strong incentive to keep the chinese onside . washington 's allies feeling the heat though no decision has been made as yet , the supporters of an end to the embargo may find themselves increasingly marginalized .
while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not . "
the eu insists arms exports will in any case be more tightly regulated by a revised " code of conduct " to be agreed soon . human rights developments could prove decisive earlier on wednesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said beijing was making progress on human rights and deserved to have the ban lifted .
" it is not justified to maintain it , " solana told reporters as he arrived for the summit .
" things are moving -lrb- on human rights -rrb- , " he said .
he noted that washington this year had not sought china 's censure at the current session of the un commission on human rights , citing some improvements . however , one of the chinese students behind the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstration , which ended in a bloody massacre by troops , appealed to european leaders on wednesday not to lift an arms embargo on beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiananmen square protests ended in a massacre .
" as china 's regime still defends the slaughtering of peaceful student protesters , the notion that the eu might be willing to make more weapons available distresses me greatly ; i can only hope that europe will keep our hopes alive , " wang dan said in the financial times . tiananmen protestor appeals to europe contrary to what solana stated , he said , human rights conditions in china were deteriorating . " some european leaders have even commended china for progress in human rights .
such claims reveal ignorance of the realities in china .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .

but the reality is that one in three kids is classed as overweight in germany , while every 13th youngster is obese . while the government combats the problem with campaigns promoting healthy eating and exercise , companies such as mail-order firm neckermann are waking up to the realization that the new " xxl nation " presents potentially lucrative new markets . neckermann has addressed the problem of ill-fitting clothing for overweight kids with a new plus-size catalog . wrong proportions " the problem is that parents of heavy children often buy clothes that are three-sizes too big , and the clothes do n't fit properly because the proportions are all wrong , " said neckermann spokeswoman alexandra eichhorn . unlike some catalogs which charge more for clothes made in larger sizes , neckermann is charging the same for its plus-size items as items from its " normal " collection . according to eichhorn , xxl children 's lines have so far been limited to specialty shops , which tend to sell at a higher price point . neckermann hopes its new line will help overweight kids who feel like outsiders or are teased by their peers to fit in better , at least when it comes to fashion . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is germany turning into an xxl country ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2005 europeans reflect on schiavo case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiavo , seen in this 2001 video , has been comatose since 1990 the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread . on a continent where physician-assisted death is far more commonplace than in the united states , the case of terri schiavo has struck a chord . schiavo , who has been in a persistent vegetative state since collapsing in her home in 1990 , has been at the center of a legal fight between her husband - her legal guardian - and her parents over her husband 's right to end her life since 1998 .
michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .
" in such situations , i always tried to bring both parties together to find a solution . " erik campano -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .

lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

the police were alerted to the situation after neighbors complained of a strong smell of excrement coming from the apartment in hanover .
when the tenant opened her door to the police on saturday , they were greeted by a swarm of flies .
inside the apartment police officers found cages containing guinea pigs , rabbits and parrots , and the floors were covered in faeces .
one of the rooms , which was originally the little girl 's , was inhabited by rats .
" my colleagues did n't open the door to the second room because the rats would have come running out , " said police spokeswoman petra holzhausen , adding that veterinary specialists were currently eradicating the rodents from the apartment .
holzhausen said the woman had clearly lost control of the situation .
" in the beginning she just kept a few rats , but they bred out of control . "
the woman admitted to continuing to feed the rodents over the last six months . dw-world.de fat cat relocates to berlin some are calling it animal cruelty , others are calling it an application of the atkins diet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2005 eu facing damaging split over china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese might have to wait a while for arms from europe while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure . french president jacques chirac said on wednesday that he still expects an agreement to lift a european union arms ban on china by the end of june , despite growing signs it could be delayed .
he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .
along with paris , berlin has been a strong backer of ending the ban with its own lucrative trade agreements with the people 's republic a strong incentive to keep the chinese onside . washington 's allies feeling the heat though no decision has been made as yet , the supporters of an end to the embargo may find themselves increasingly marginalized .
while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not . "
the eu insists arms exports will in any case be more tightly regulated by a revised " code of conduct " to be agreed soon . human rights developments could prove decisive earlier on wednesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said beijing was making progress on human rights and deserved to have the ban lifted .
" it is not justified to maintain it , " solana told reporters as he arrived for the summit .
" things are moving -lrb- on human rights -rrb- , " he said .
he noted that washington this year had not sought china 's censure at the current session of the un commission on human rights , citing some improvements . however , one of the chinese students behind the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstration , which ended in a bloody massacre by troops , appealed to european leaders on wednesday not to lift an arms embargo on beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiananmen square protests ended in a massacre .
" as china 's regime still defends the slaughtering of peaceful student protesters , the notion that the eu might be willing to make more weapons available distresses me greatly ; i can only hope that europe will keep our hopes alive , " wang dan said in the financial times . tiananmen protestor appeals to europe contrary to what solana stated , he said , human rights conditions in china were deteriorating . " some european leaders have even commended china for progress in human rights .
such claims reveal ignorance of the realities in china .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2005 eu leaders to rewrite services bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board again european leaders approved watered-down financial regulations tuesday while also scaling back a plan to liberalize the service sector intended to help the eu become more economically competitive . the summit is focused on relaunching the lisbon agenda , launched five years ago in the heat of the dot-com boom with the lofty aim of making europe the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2005 europeans reflect on schiavo case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiavo , seen in this 2001 video , has been comatose since 1990 the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread . on a continent where physician-assisted death is far more commonplace than in the united states , the case of terri schiavo has struck a chord . schiavo , who has been in a persistent vegetative state since collapsing in her home in 1990 , has been at the center of a legal fight between her husband - her legal guardian - and her parents over her husband 's right to end her life since 1998 .
michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .
" in such situations , i always tried to bring both parties together to find a solution . " erik campano -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .
it reinforces european air transport , " he added . federal and local authorities along with swiss businesses owned 86 percent of the airline , having investedy more than 2 billion swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.7 billion , 1.28 billion euros -rrb- under a national rescue package put together after the former flag carrier swissair went bankrupt in 2001 . trading in the swiss 's shares was suspended on tuesday at the company 's request . the airline 's share price had closed at 9.6 swiss francs friday , equivalent to barely one tenth of its value when the airline was launched .
lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .
it reinforces european air transport , " he added . federal and local authorities along with swiss businesses owned 86 percent of the airline , having investedy more than 2 billion swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.7 billion , 1.28 billion euros -rrb- under a national rescue package put together after the former flag carrier swissair went bankrupt in 2001 . trading in the swiss 's shares was suspended on tuesday at the company 's request . the airline 's share price had closed at 9.6 swiss francs friday , equivalent to barely one tenth of its value when the airline was launched .
lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .

however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters .

the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .

while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not .

he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .

while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not .

the eu insists arms exports will in any case be more tightly regulated by a revised " code of conduct " to be agreed soon . human rights developments could prove decisive earlier on wednesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said beijing was making progress on human rights and deserved to have the ban lifted .
" it is not justified to maintain it , " solana told reporters as he arrived for the summit .
" things are moving -lrb- on human rights -rrb- , " he said .
he noted that washington this year had not sought china 's censure at the current session of the un commission on human rights , citing some improvements . however , one of the chinese students behind the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstration , which ended in a bloody massacre by troops , appealed to european leaders on wednesday not to lift an arms embargo on beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiananmen square protests ended in a massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2005 eu facing damaging split over china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese might have to wait a while for arms from europe while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure . french president jacques chirac said on wednesday that he still expects an agreement to lift a european union arms ban on china by the end of june , despite growing signs it could be delayed .
he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .
along with paris , berlin has been a strong backer of ending the ban with its own lucrative trade agreements with the people 's republic a strong incentive to keep the chinese onside . washington 's allies feeling the heat though no decision has been made as yet , the supporters of an end to the embargo may find themselves increasingly marginalized .
while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not . "
the eu insists arms exports will in any case be more tightly regulated by a revised " code of conduct " to be agreed soon . human rights developments could prove decisive earlier on wednesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said beijing was making progress on human rights and deserved to have the ban lifted .
" it is not justified to maintain it , " solana told reporters as he arrived for the summit .
" things are moving -lrb- on human rights -rrb- , " he said .
he noted that washington this year had not sought china 's censure at the current session of the un commission on human rights , citing some improvements . however , one of the chinese students behind the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstration , which ended in a bloody massacre by troops , appealed to european leaders on wednesday not to lift an arms embargo on beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiananmen square protests ended in a massacre .
" as china 's regime still defends the slaughtering of peaceful student protesters , the notion that the eu might be willing to make more weapons available distresses me greatly ; i can only hope that europe will keep our hopes alive , " wang dan said in the financial times . tiananmen protestor appeals to europe contrary to what solana stated , he said , human rights conditions in china were deteriorating . " some european leaders have even commended china for progress in human rights .
such claims reveal ignorance of the realities in china .

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .
it reinforces european air transport , " he added . federal and local authorities along with swiss businesses owned 86 percent of the airline , having investedy more than 2 billion swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.7 billion , 1.28 billion euros -rrb- under a national rescue package put together after the former flag carrier swissair went bankrupt in 2001 . trading in the swiss 's shares was suspended on tuesday at the company 's request . the airline 's share price had closed at 9.6 swiss francs friday , equivalent to barely one tenth of its value when the airline was launched .
lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

sommer said that the " the protests by 60,000 union members from around europe had obviously persuaded the decision makers that a europe still heading toward lower social standards has no future . " an estimated 50,000 demonstrators from across the continent took part in a protest in brussels at the weekend against the plans , which have been dubbed the bolkestein directive , after former eu commissioner frits bolkestein . the directive is intended to slash red tape and create a genuine single market in europe in the services sector , which accounts for almost 70 percent of the eu 's gross domestic product and jobs .
it is a major part of the lisbon agenda , set out five years ago at the height of the dot-com bubble when eu leaders vowed to turn europe into the world 's leading knowledge-based economy by 2010 .
trade unions however say it will drive standards and wages down to the level of the poorer countries and encourage businesses to set up their headquarters in countries where the laws are weakest . dw-world.de eu leaders to rewrite services bill european leaders approved watered-down financial regulations tuesday while also scaling back a plan to liberalize the service sector intended to help the eu become more economically competitive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2005 berlin-based hate preacher expelled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign preachers are under increased scrutiny in germany invoking new anti-hate legislation , a berlin court ruled wednesday that a well-known turkish religious leader accused of preaching hatred should be extradited to turkey . the administrative court in berlin accused 59-year-old yacub tadshi of asking for god ’ s protection for suicide bombers in israel and iraq during a rally in the city center in 2004 . that same year , the muslim preacher of turkish origin who has lived in berlin since 1971 used the occasion of an early ramadan prayer to lash out against native germans in his mevlana mosque in kreuzberg .
tadshi said germans could only expect the flames of hell for their weird beliefs . german public tv correspondent reinhard laska filmed the imam ’ s address . “ we were able to show how the imam insulted all germans in his berlin mosque , " he said .
" he repeatedly said that all germans were stinking people and doomed to go to hell because they were useless creatures and infidels .
his words were all the more shocking as shortly before , the press spokesman of this mosque had told us about the turks ’ strong interest in fostering good relations with native germans .
he said it was so important for people of different faiths to share views and live together peacefully – what a lie that turned out to be ! ” frequent tirades laska said he was n't surprised over the ruling : the man had raised the hackles of municipal authorities many times in the past . “ yacoub tadshi was well known for his frequent tirades against germans , " he said .
" for instance , he wouldn ’ t stop short of advising turkish residents to keep their children away from germans who , in his view , were having an evil influence on them . " berlin ’ s interior menator , ehrhart körting , is glad that the imam ’ s days in the german capital are numbered .
he said that action had to be taken when the freedom of belief was abused and turned into open expressions of hatred against a whole people . he 's in luck : in january , a new legisislation came into effect that makes it easier for authorities to expel non-german groups or people who preach hate or incite violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heart of the community tip of the iceberg tv correspondent reinhard laska fears that the opinions voiced by the imam are only the tip of the iceberg : “ there was nobody in the mosque who stood up and demanded that the imam stop his nasty talk about germans , " he said .
" nobody seemed to mind at all .
we asked people as they were leaving the mosque to tell us what they thought about the imam .
everyone was looking daggers at us , and we certainly didn ’ t have the impression that the imam had voiced an isolated opinion . ” yacub tadshi has meanwhile gone into hiding .
but he said through his lawyer that he would leave the country voluntarily very soon , following the court ’ s verdict .
the imam is co-founder of the influential islamic federation – an organisation in berlin which is responsible for organizing the teaching of islam at schools attended by muslim pupils . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " caliph of cologne " trial postponed the trial of metin kaplan on monday was postponed until april pending reform of turkey 's legal system .

when the tenant opened her door to the police on saturday , they were greeted by a swarm of flies .
inside the apartment police officers found cages containing guinea pigs , rabbits and parrots , and the floors were covered in faeces .
one of the rooms , which was originally the little girl 's , was inhabited by rats .
" my colleagues did n't open the door to the second room because the rats would have come running out , " said police spokeswoman petra holzhausen , adding that veterinary specialists were currently eradicating the rodents from the apartment .
holzhausen said the woman had clearly lost control of the situation .
" in the beginning she just kept a few rats , but they bred out of control . "

he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters .

he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .
along with paris , berlin has been a strong backer of ending the ban with its own lucrative trade agreements with the people 's republic a strong incentive to keep the chinese onside . washington 's allies feeling the heat though no decision has been made as yet , the supporters of an end to the embargo may find themselves increasingly marginalized .
while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not . "
the eu insists arms exports will in any case be more tightly regulated by a revised " code of conduct " to be agreed soon . human rights developments could prove decisive earlier on wednesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said beijing was making progress on human rights and deserved to have the ban lifted .
" it is not justified to maintain it , " solana told reporters as he arrived for the summit .
" things are moving -lrb- on human rights -rrb- , " he said .
he noted that washington this year had not sought china 's censure at the current session of the un commission on human rights , citing some improvements . however , one of the chinese students behind the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstration , which ended in a bloody massacre by troops , appealed to european leaders on wednesday not to lift an arms embargo on beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiananmen square protests ended in a massacre .
" as china 's regime still defends the slaughtering of peaceful student protesters , the notion that the eu might be willing to make more weapons available distresses me greatly ; i can only hope that europe will keep our hopes alive , " wang dan said in the financial times . tiananmen protestor appeals to europe contrary to what solana stated , he said , human rights conditions in china were deteriorating . " some european leaders have even commended china for progress in human rights .
such claims reveal ignorance of the realities in china .
no doubt everyone has watched the country 's economic progress , but in political reform china has gone backwards , " dan said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de feeding asia 's giant with arms and autos here , dw-world presents a selection of stories that relate to the current state of economic and political relations between germany and the world 's most populous country , china .

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .

franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model .

about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late . " we need to hear from him on a european level before then .
we need to know his basic position on the -lrb- un -rrb- millennium development goals , and his view of how he would lead the world bank , " he said . german finance minister hans eichel - whose boss chancellor gerhard schröder has already given the thumbs-up to the deputy us defense secretary - said that nevertheless more talks were needed .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2005 eu facing damaging split over china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese might have to wait a while for arms from europe while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure . french president jacques chirac said on wednesday that he still expects an agreement to lift a european union arms ban on china by the end of june , despite growing signs it could be delayed .
he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .
along with paris , berlin has been a strong backer of ending the ban with its own lucrative trade agreements with the people 's republic a strong incentive to keep the chinese onside . washington 's allies feeling the heat though no decision has been made as yet , the supporters of an end to the embargo may find themselves increasingly marginalized .
while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not . "

nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .

germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .

he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .
the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .
about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late . " we need to hear from him on a european level before then .
we need to know his basic position on the -lrb- un -rrb- millennium development goals , and his view of how he would lead the world bank , " he said . german finance minister hans eichel - whose boss chancellor gerhard schröder has already given the thumbs-up to the deputy us defense secretary - said that nevertheless more talks were needed . " he 's a high level candidate , but there needs to be more discussions before his election , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .
it reinforces european air transport , " he added . federal and local authorities along with swiss businesses owned 86 percent of the airline , having investedy more than 2 billion swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.7 billion , 1.28 billion euros -rrb- under a national rescue package put together after the former flag carrier swissair went bankrupt in 2001 . trading in the swiss 's shares was suspended on tuesday at the company 's request . the airline 's share price had closed at 9.6 swiss francs friday , equivalent to barely one tenth of its value when the airline was launched .
lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.03.2005 swiss to fly under lufthansa 's wing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss shareholders cast aside national pride to aid their airlines the german airline lufthansa on tuesday took over ailing swiss international air lines after major shareholders in the swiss carrier approved a deal worth up to 310 million euros -lrb- $ 409 million -rrb- . lufthansa and swiss said in a joint statement that their boards had endorsed the agreement , which was to be signed by chief executives wolfgang mayrhuber and christoph franz in zurich later in the evening . the agreement was clinched after major swiss shareholders , led by the swiss government with its 20.4 percent stake , met tuesday to approve the takeover by its bigger and healthier german rival . with swiss 's financial horizon clouded by stiff competition and fuel prices , other key swiss shareholders , including regional authorities , the swiss banks ubs and credit suisse and swiss blue chip groups such as nestle , novartis and roche , also cast aside national pride to back the deal . " as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .
it reinforces european air transport , " he added . federal and local authorities along with swiss businesses owned 86 percent of the airline , having investedy more than 2 billion swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.7 billion , 1.28 billion euros -rrb- under a national rescue package put together after the former flag carrier swissair went bankrupt in 2001 . trading in the swiss 's shares was suspended on tuesday at the company 's request . the airline 's share price had closed at 9.6 swiss francs friday , equivalent to barely one tenth of its value when the airline was launched .
lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2005 europeans reflect on schiavo case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiavo , seen in this 2001 video , has been comatose since 1990 the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread . on a continent where physician-assisted death is far more commonplace than in the united states , the case of terri schiavo has struck a chord . schiavo , who has been in a persistent vegetative state since collapsing in her home in 1990 , has been at the center of a legal fight between her husband - her legal guardian - and her parents over her husband 's right to end her life since 1998 .
michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .
" in such situations , i always tried to bring both parties together to find a solution . " erik campano -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2005 europeans reflect on schiavo case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiavo , seen in this 2001 video , has been comatose since 1990 the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread . on a continent where physician-assisted death is far more commonplace than in the united states , the case of terri schiavo has struck a chord . schiavo , who has been in a persistent vegetative state since collapsing in her home in 1990 , has been at the center of a legal fight between her husband - her legal guardian - and her parents over her husband 's right to end her life since 1998 .
michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .
" in such situations , i always tried to bring both parties together to find a solution . " erik campano -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .

lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.03.2005 europeans reflect on schiavo case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiavo , seen in this 2001 video , has been comatose since 1990 the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread . on a continent where physician-assisted death is far more commonplace than in the united states , the case of terri schiavo has struck a chord . schiavo , who has been in a persistent vegetative state since collapsing in her home in 1990 , has been at the center of a legal fight between her husband - her legal guardian - and her parents over her husband 's right to end her life since 1998 .
michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .
" in such situations , i always tried to bring both parties together to find a solution . " erik campano -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2005 eu leaders to rewrite services bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board again european leaders approved watered-down financial regulations tuesday while also scaling back a plan to liberalize the service sector intended to help the eu become more economically competitive . the summit is focused on relaunching the lisbon agenda , launched five years ago in the heat of the dot-com boom with the lofty aim of making europe the world 's most competitive economy by 2010 .
" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .
the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .
about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late . " we need to hear from him on a european level before then .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .
the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .
about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late .

he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .
the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .
about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late . " we need to hear from him on a european level before then .
we need to know his basic position on the -lrb- un -rrb- millennium development goals , and his view of how he would lead the world bank , " he said . german finance minister hans eichel - whose boss chancellor gerhard schröder has already given the thumbs-up to the deputy us defense secretary - said that nevertheless more talks were needed .

opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .
the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .
about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late . " we need to hear from him on a european level before then .
we need to know his basic position on the -lrb- un -rrb- millennium development goals , and his view of how he would lead the world bank , " he said . german finance minister hans eichel - whose boss chancellor gerhard schröder has already given the thumbs-up to the deputy us defense secretary - said that nevertheless more talks were needed . " he 's a high level candidate , but there needs to be more discussions before his election , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.03.2005 eu facing damaging split over china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese might have to wait a while for arms from europe while france and germany lead a group of eu countries intent on ending the arms embargo on china , some are becoming nervous due to chinese moves against taiwan and increasing us pressure . french president jacques chirac said on wednesday that he still expects an agreement to lift a european union arms ban on china by the end of june , despite growing signs it could be delayed .
he recalled that an eu summit in december had agreed to aim for an end to the 15-year-old embargo under the luxembourg eu presidency , which runs until june 30 . eu leaders had agreed that " the current presidency must assure the lifting of the embargo on china ...
nothing leads me to believe that there will be a change on this subject , " chirac said at the end of a two-day eu summit in brussels . the eu arms ban was slapped on china after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy students in beijing 's tiananmen square , but france has led a group of eu countries arguing that it is outdated and should be lifted . schröder stands firm on shaky foundations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer and chancellor gerhard schröder at the brussels summit one of the major backers of the french stance is staunch ally , germany .
" nothing has changed , and nothing has changed in my position , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
however , a threatened technology embargo against europe which was discussed by the us congress has shaken the resolve of some german supporters . " we were told there could be consequences if the eu lifted the embargo , " said werner hoyer , foreign affairs spokesman for the liberal opposition party , the fdp .
the greens , the junior partner in chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government , have also started to question the timing for lifting the embargo . leading green officials said china had not sufficiently improved its human rights record to warrant an end to the embargo .
germany 's opposition parties , meanwhile , are preparing to put the issue to a vote next month in the german parliament , in a move that could split and further weaken schröder 's social democrat-led coalition . anti-secession law heightens concern chirac 's remarks came amid growing signs that the 25-member eu could be affected enough by the growing international opposition to delay the decision , most notably because of " complications " triggered by china 's new anti-secession law targeting taiwan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soldiers beijing 's passing of the law granting it the right to use force to curtail independence moves by taiwan has made countries including britain more wary of the move , which the us fears would give china access to advanced weaponry .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice has warned that ending the embargo would send the wrong signal at a time of increased tensions . president chirac moved to reassure the us on tuesday on the subject of weapons sales to a reopened chinese market .
" the europeans have no intention of launching a policy of arms exports to china , which is not asking for this , " he told the japanese daily asahi shimbun .
" what the europeans want to do is normalize relations with china . " france and germany look set to continue lobbying for the embargo to be scrapped despite growing discontent .
france in particular sees boosting trade and diplomatic ties with china as a way of counter-balancing us world power .
along with paris , berlin has been a strong backer of ending the ban with its own lucrative trade agreements with the people 's republic a strong incentive to keep the chinese onside . washington 's allies feeling the heat though no decision has been made as yet , the supporters of an end to the embargo may find themselves increasingly marginalized .
while france and germany are in favor of ending the embargo , other eu nations - notably those with closer links to washington - side with london in the cautious camp . if the eu climbs down on the embargo , it will be a serious embarrassment for the bloc 's efforts to forge a common policy over an issue that had already divided the 25 member states , according to diplomats and security analysts at the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana eu foreign policy head javier solana declined to forecast if the eu could meet its target of lifting the embargo by june , saying : " it is too early to say whether we will be able to finish on time or not . "
the eu insists arms exports will in any case be more tightly regulated by a revised " code of conduct " to be agreed soon . human rights developments could prove decisive earlier on wednesday , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said beijing was making progress on human rights and deserved to have the ban lifted .
" it is not justified to maintain it , " solana told reporters as he arrived for the summit .
" things are moving -lrb- on human rights -rrb- , " he said .
he noted that washington this year had not sought china 's censure at the current session of the un commission on human rights , citing some improvements . however , one of the chinese students behind the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy demonstration , which ended in a bloody massacre by troops , appealed to european leaders on wednesday not to lift an arms embargo on beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiananmen square protests ended in a massacre .
" as china 's regime still defends the slaughtering of peaceful student protesters , the notion that the eu might be willing to make more weapons available distresses me greatly ; i can only hope that europe will keep our hopes alive , " wang dan said in the financial times . tiananmen protestor appeals to europe contrary to what solana stated , he said , human rights conditions in china were deteriorating . " some european leaders have even commended china for progress in human rights .
such claims reveal ignorance of the realities in china .

michael schiavo went to court eight years ago for the right to remove her feeding tube , saying that she would have never wanted to live in such a state . this past week , the us congress forced the case from the supreme court , which had ruled in michael schiavo 's favor , back to a florida district court .
the court on tuesday denied schiavo 's parents the right to restore her feeding tube , a decision that will be appealed . holland : 2,000 assisted in death each year european countries like the netherlands , switzerland and belgium allow physician-assisted death in various incarnations .
in holland alone , about 2,000 people die through assistance from their doctor each year .
but schiavo would n't be one of them . dutch laws , like those in switzerland and belgium , require that the patient clearly and insistently request death .
schiavo , had she ever requested death should she fall into a vegetative state , did not insist on it .
for this reason , even relatively socially liberal groups , like the union of protestant churches in germany , or the german medical association , have not recommended removing schiavo 's feeding tube . question of recovery divides " the patient 's doctors are required to continue to treat her and to feed her , because it 's not clear what will happen next with her illness , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the head of the german medical association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jörg-dietrich hoppe -lrb- on the right -rrb- says doctors ca n't be sure that schiavo wo n't recover doctors consulted by michael schiavo have testified in court that terri will never recover from her state - in which she can not think or speak and is unaware of her surroundings .
doctors brought by her parents disagree and say it would be against terri 's religion , as a roman catholic , to die this way . hoppe said there have been cases " of people who lived for 20 years in a ' waking coma ' and then later came back to consciousness .
the patient is certainly not dead . " dutch pave way for euthanasia legalization fifteen years ago , holland had a case similar to schiavo 's , a judge allowed the husband of ineke stinissen , who had been in a coma for several years , to remove her feeding tube .
she died of starvation , and her case paved the way for holland 's pro-euthanasia legislation . in germany , schiavo 's case would have gone to court much in the same way it did in the us .
german law forbids doctors to actively assist in a patient 's suicide but allows them to passively allow death if the patient clearly wills it .
but ruth mattheis , the former head of the medical association and a doctor for more than 50 years said she could not remember such a case every making it to trial . " quite often , families addressed me and asked for help , mostly families who wanted to stop nutrition -lrb- where -rrb- the doctors opposed it , " she said .
" in such situations , i always tried to bring both parties together to find a solution . " erik campano -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?

" as a member of the lufthansa group , swiss will be better placed to assume its role in linking switzerland to the rest of the world over the long term , " franz said . swiss suffered after 2001 rescue package mayrhuber -lrb- photo -rrb- said lufthansa 's customers would benefit from more destinations , more connections , and improved service .
" the merger of our two companies is not only positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber for switzerland and germany but also for our partners in star alliance .
it reinforces european air transport , " he added . federal and local authorities along with swiss businesses owned 86 percent of the airline , having investedy more than 2 billion swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.7 billion , 1.28 billion euros -rrb- under a national rescue package put together after the former flag carrier swissair went bankrupt in 2001 . trading in the swiss 's shares was suspended on tuesday at the company 's request . the airline 's share price had closed at 9.6 swiss francs friday , equivalent to barely one tenth of its value when the airline was launched .
lufthansa said it expected to pay between 45 million and about 300 million euros for swiss as the deal - the full cost of which will depend on the german airline 's share performance - is gradually rolled out until 2008 . deal made to save jobs switzerland 's government said it had accepted lufthansa 's offer , even though it represented only a fraction of its investment , because other strategies would have put jobs at risk . the federal council also insisted in a statement that it they would not have been able to afford forthcoming investments of several hundred million swiss francs to upgrade equipment and aircraft . lufthansa and swiss revealed publicly for the first time on march 14 that they were in " constructive " takeover talks , following months of speculation about secret meetings between company executives . swiss was plagued by heavy losses form the outset , but had managed to narrow them over the past year amid a massive restructuring drive that slashed one third of the company 's staff and one third of its fleet . after restructuring , more cuts ahead former lufthansa executive franz , who took over at swiss in june 2004 , announced more cuts this year as swiss grappled with rising oil prices and struggled against budget competition in europe . he reiterated tuesday that those cuts must go through to ensure zurich 's value as a hub to the new group .
franz warned earlier this month that operating results at swiss were still unsatisfactory , urging staff unions to agree to a further 1,000 job cuts over the next 18 months and to renegotiate collective contract agreements by the end of 2005 to cut costs . executives at swiss had staked the fledgling company 's long-term survival on joining a major industry alliance as early as 2002 .
but a deal with british airways on joining the oneworld alliance fell through one year ago , prompting the revival of simmering behind-the-scenes talks with its huge german rival . a new dawn for older carriers analysts have predicted that the deal should speed up consolidation in the european airline industry as more older carriers join forces to compete against low-cost competition . swiss cut its consolidated net loss to 140 million swiss francs -lrb- 90 million euros , $ 118 million -rrb- in 2004 , against 687 million swiss francs a year earlier . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss contemplates the lufthansa lifeline the possible takeover of swiss by lufthansa has some fearing the loss of national identity .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model .

the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .

" we need to hear from him on a european level before then .
we need to know his basic position on the -lrb- un -rrb- millennium development goals , and his view of how he would lead the world bank , " he said . german finance minister hans eichel - whose boss chancellor gerhard schröder has already given the thumbs-up to the deputy us defense secretary - said that nevertheless more talks were needed .

" we want to redynamise the lisbon strategy to focus on growth and competitiveness ... to end the economic slowdown , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency . but , on tuesday eu ministers instead rolled back the ambitious plans , caving in to pressure to water down the particularly controversial plan to liberalize the services sector that would throw open businessess to cross-border competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the services deregulation plan , the so called bolkestein directive , would have dismantled service sector trade barriers and opened up the eu member 's markets to service industries such as construction and computers .
it was intended to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and increase lagging economic growth rates by 2010 . but french and german leaders fiercely opposed the draft in its original form saying that it would spur an influx of cheap foreign workers from the new eastern eu countries such as poland .
labor costs are about one-fifth in the east . both countries have unemployment rates topping 10 percent . in france , fears over the effects of the services directive have led to a surge in support for opponents of the eu 's first ever constitution which french voters will decide on in a referendum may 29 . it is widely accepted that if france votes to reject the constitution , it would be a devastating blow to the entire eu project - the constitution , which strengthens the organs of the eu , must be passed by each of the eu 's 25 members . unacceptable , they say unions and local politicians have howled over the initiative , saying it will threaten wages , employment consumer rights and environmental standards because the original version of the plan would have allowed companies to provide services throughout the eu while operating under the laws of their own country . bildunterschrift : an estimated 50,000 people march during a demonstration in downtown brussels . on saturday more than 50,000 demonstrators marched in brussels saturday against the proposed eu directive to open up public service markets , which unions say will drive down social and labor standards and threaten jobs .
opponents fear the directive will lead to " social dumping " -companies and jobs either relocating to the low-cost economies of eastern europe , or service companies from eastern europe flooding into the west .
eu leaders - knowing they have to reform a sector that accounts for 70 percent of the eu economy - have sent the draft plan back to the european commission for revision . " we need to open up the services market , " said eu commission president josé manuel barroso .
" but we need to do it while fully respecting the european social model . " stability pact undermined meanwhile , the eu approved a proposal to loosen fiscal rules in the stability and growth pact - originally created to support the euro - and let national budget deficits creep up over 3 percent of gross domestic product under particular circumstances without punishment .
the new rules will let the biggest violators , france and germany off the hook and allows germany to deduct reunification costs from its deficit tally . germany , who originally authored the rules , has violated them three years in a row .
about half the eu member states exceeded the 3 percent rule . eu wants to meet wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul wolfowitz meanwhile , eu finance ministers agreed tuesday that us nominee for world bank chief paul wolfowitz - a key architect of the us-led war in iraq - is a " serious candidate , " but said they want to hear his views in person , possibly in the next 10 days . " i did n't see any very negative attitudes about him , so i think he is taken as a serious candidate by everybody , " dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told reporters . austria 's karl-heinz grasser , asked if wolfowitz could present his views to the next meeting of eu finance ministers scheduled for april 11-12 , said that would be too late . " we need to hear from him on a european level before then .
we need to know his basic position on the -lrb- un -rrb- millennium development goals , and his view of how he would lead the world bank , " he said . german finance minister hans eichel - whose boss chancellor gerhard schröder has already given the thumbs-up to the deputy us defense secretary - said that nevertheless more talks were needed . " he 's a high level candidate , but there needs to be more discussions before his election , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- demonstrators march against eu labor reforms demonstrators mobilized by a group of european trade unions paralyzed the bloc 's center of power on saturday as 50,000 took to the streets of brussels to protest against proposed labor reforms in the eu .
-lrb- march 20 , 2005 -rrb- economy in spotlight at eu summit jobs and growth will top the agenda at the two-day summit of eu leaders kicking off tuesday .
another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank .

transport minister david jamieson will perform the ceremony on the stretch of dual carriageway on the a21 , taking traffic around lamberhurst .
work began on the 3km road nearly two years ago - it had been due to open in the autumn but bad weather and problems cutting through soil caused delays .

the £ 12m scheme is part of the plans to improve the a21 between pembury , in kent , and hastings , on the sussex coast .
the contract was awarded to may gurney in march 2003 and work started within a few months .
along with the road there are two new roundabouts at each end , the reconstruction of about a kilometre of the a262 , a large land bridge at the entrance to scotney castle , and a new bridge over the river teise .
during the construction , engineers came across great crested newts , badgers and dormice .

psychologists there have found that babies weaned on rusks are more likely to go on to prefer beige foods , such as crisps and chips , later in life .
the researchers said children built up a " visual prototype " of favoured foods .
but babies exposed to a range of tastes by the age of one , including fruit and vegetables , went on to show a greater preference for those tastes later on .
' parental anxiety ' children 's vision of the kind of food they liked to eat would lead them to reject foods that do not fit into this category without even tasting them , the study found .
researchers believe this could explain why so many children initially reject green foods like vegetables .
dr gillian harris , a clinical psychologist at the university , said : " there is so much parental anxiety these days that parents do n't feel that they can give their children broccoli , for example , and feel that food out of a jar or packet is a safer option for their child .
" there is uncertainty and a lack of education about how children should be fed and this can lead to children 's preferences being set at a very early age .
" i would recommend that where possible , parents give their children the same food that they are eating provided it is a balanced diet containing fruit and vegetables , to introduce them to new colours , textures and shapes . "
