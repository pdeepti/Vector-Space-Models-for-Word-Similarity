the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?

but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .
despite all efforts , he said , " the status quo could be maintained " in the security council , " and that would be tragic .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .

in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

the city-state said in a statement it had paid 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the site , where more than 2,000 foreigners from german-occupied countries were put to work during world war ii . the memorial , in schöneweide in the east of the capital , will be managed by the topography of terror foundation , which also runs a documentation center in the former berlin headquarters of the gestapo secret police .
the camp was opened in 1943 under the supervision of armaments minister albert speer . berlin culture senator thomas flierl said that the memorial would be the first in germany to document the lives of forced laborers under the nazis .
the 3.3-hectare -lrb- 8.2-acre -rrb- site features still-intact stone barracks and workshops , many of which were threatened with collapse .
the memorial is expected to open in the summer of 2006 . german companies and the nazi regime operated a massive forced labor program during world war ii , enslaving hundreds of thousands of people to build railroads and air bases and work in factories , military production and concentration camps .
it was instituted to replace a work force that had been recruited for the war effort .
the german government and industry established a 5.1-billion-euro restitution fund in 2000 after negotiations with victims ' groups and the governments of the united states , israel and several eastern european countries . dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

the camp was opened in 1943 under the supervision of armaments minister albert speer . berlin culture senator thomas flierl said that the memorial would be the first in germany to document the lives of forced laborers under the nazis .
the 3.3-hectare -lrb- 8.2-acre -rrb- site features still-intact stone barracks and workshops , many of which were threatened with collapse .
the memorial is expected to open in the summer of 2006 . german companies and the nazi regime operated a massive forced labor program during world war ii , enslaving hundreds of thousands of people to build railroads and air bases and work in factories , military production and concentration camps .
it was instituted to replace a work force that had been recruited for the war effort .
the german government and industry established a 5.1-billion-euro restitution fund in 2000 after negotiations with victims ' groups and the governments of the united states , israel and several eastern european countries . dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

the city-state said in a statement it had paid 1.4 million euros -lrb- $ 1.7 million -rrb- for the site , where more than 2,000 foreigners from german-occupied countries were put to work during world war ii . the memorial , in schöneweide in the east of the capital , will be managed by the topography of terror foundation , which also runs a documentation center in the former berlin headquarters of the gestapo secret police .
the camp was opened in 1943 under the supervision of armaments minister albert speer . berlin culture senator thomas flierl said that the memorial would be the first in germany to document the lives of forced laborers under the nazis .
the 3.3-hectare -lrb- 8.2-acre -rrb- site features still-intact stone barracks and workshops , many of which were threatened with collapse .
the memorial is expected to open in the summer of 2006 . german companies and the nazi regime operated a massive forced labor program during world war ii , enslaving hundreds of thousands of people to build railroads and air bases and work in factories , military production and concentration camps .
it was instituted to replace a work force that had been recruited for the war effort .
the german government and industry established a 5.1-billion-euro restitution fund in 2000 after negotiations with victims ' groups and the governments of the united states , israel and several eastern european countries . dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .
but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

" the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .
but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list .

it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .
top drawer tourist site full of treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the lvr building the cologne cathedral was added to the world heritage list in 1996 and is one of the country 's top tourist draws .
the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .
new sites up for consideration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as passing judgment on the cologne cathedral , the whc will consider 28 cultural sites , 10 natural sites and four mixed sites presented by 44 countries , including albania , china and host country south africa as possible additions to unesco 's world heritage list . four countries - bahrain , bosnia-herzegovina , gabon and moldova - could see one of their sites join the list for the first time , a committee statement read . the durban meeting is the first whc session held in the sub-saharan africa since 1972 , when unesco approved a convention concerning the protection of the world 's cultural and natural heritage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne angered by unesco criticism cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .

observers in germany say serbia 's future hinges on a readiness to take responsibility . " when condemning crimes , it is of decisive importance not to distinguish between innocent victims according to their nationality or faith .
the serbian government strongly condemns all war crimes committed during the civil war in the former yugoslavia . " in this recent statement , belgrade did not single out the srebrenica massacre as the worst war crime committed on european soil since the end of world war ii as many had hoped .
instead , it called it a " serious crime " along with atrocities against ethnic serbs during the war . it 's a sign that the balkan country is still struggling to come to terms with its past despite recent signs that the war 's worst criminals might finally be brought to justice . us officials recently voiced their conviction that ratko mladic , the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , would spend the anniversary in prison awaiting trial before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
mladic and bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic have evaded arrest for a decade . changing public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of srebrenica massacre displayed in an abandoned hall near srebrenica , on july 10 , 2004 .
the recent broadcast of a graphic video showing serb paramilitaries killing muslims on serbian television also led to a change in opinion among the population : in a survey , a majority backed the extradition of war criminals for the first time . arresting karadzic and mladic is crucial for serbia 's future and possible eu membership , according to observers in germany , where about 700,000 serbs make up the second largest group of immigrants , behind turks . " serbia has extradited some war criminals to the hague , but not the two most important ones , " said milan kosanovic , who teaches eastern european history at the university of bonn and runs a foundation that aims to strengthen scientific and cultural ties between germany and serbia . " that 's the real problem , " he said , adding that the failure to send karadzic and mladic to the hague was symptomatic of serbia 's split view of the war . a need for testimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures next to them , some of the dozens found by the expert commission for pow 's and missing persons near srebrenica .
" many people say they did n't know what was happening - despite the proof , despite the mass graves , despite the thousands of witnesses who survived , " said bosiljka schedlich , a croatian who runs a berlin organization that promotes dialogue between different ethnic groups in the balkans . " it would be a very important thing for the serbs to have these men testify what they did , " schedlich said , adding that the current situation in serbia is similar to the situation in germany a decade after world war ii . " people still have to find themselves , but unlike in postwar germany , it 's not clear where things are going , " she said .
" a united europe is the only thing that can be offered to the people there .
it 's the light at the end of the tunnel . " setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- with german chancellor gerhard schröder in may others pointed to serbian leaders ' willingness to take more responsibility as witnessed by serbian president boris tadic 's decision to attend monday 's ceremony in srebrenica . " it 's important to set an example : ' we 're ready to admit our guilt irrespective of what the other side does , " ' said dusan vasiljevic , a dentist in northwestern germany who heads the german branch of tadic 's democratic party and served as an advisor to serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica during his time as yugoslav president . but when asked about the importance of the arrests of karadzic and mladic for serbia 's future , vasiljevic said there was a difference between the two men . " karadzic is not a serbian problem , he 's a bosnian problem , " he said , adding that the former psychologist and poet is not a citizen of serbia and montenegro .
" mladic has both citizenships and kostunica has clearly said that he should be in prison by september .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "

bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .
several months before the murder he directed a short film called " submission , " which was critical of abuses against women under islam . a letter was left on his body that included quotations from the koran and threats to several dutch politicians , including somali-born lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali who wrote the script for " submission . " bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .

bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .

" bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .
despite all efforts , he said , " the status quo could be maintained " in the security council , " and that would be tragic .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .

the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2005 competing plans threaten un reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security council reform : mission impossible ?
germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .
despite all efforts , he said , " the status quo could be maintained " in the security council , " and that would be tragic .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

but i 'm not very optimistic about the future . " aggravated by unification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's current woes have undoubtedly been aggravated by the challenges arising from german reunification in 1990 .
approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .
it is a view shared by many long-time spd supporters . " i 'm done with the social democrats , they 're no longer the party of the workers , " said joachim wolf , an out-of-work mechanic from eastern berlin .
" it 's all about what 's best for big business these days .

the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2005 van gogh trial opens under high security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh 's murder shocked holland and caused ethnic tensions the trial of mohammed bouyeri , a moroccan dutch national accused of the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , opened monday at a high security court in amsterdam .
bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .
several months before the murder he directed a short film called " submission , " which was critical of abuses against women under islam . a letter was left on his body that included quotations from the koran and threats to several dutch politicians , including somali-born lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali who wrote the script for " submission . " bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .
the assassination caused a surge in ethnic tension in the netherlands and a wave of over 150 reprisal attacks on mosques , islamic schools and churches followed . bouyeri is charged with murdering van gogh , attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders and obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament .
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison .
under dutch law a life sentence is applied in the literal sense . even though prosecutors have said that bouyeri was " a leading figure " in a terrorist organization known as the hofstad group he has not yet been charged in that connection as they do not have sufficient evidence . possible second trial on terrorist charges monday 's trial will therefore only focus on van gogh 's murder and related events .
under the dutch legal system , bouyeri could be separately tried later for membership in a terrorist organization . security was tight around the courtroom with a sniffer dog checking the building and its surroundings for bombs and all visitors and media thoroughly searched . the court has set two days for the trial , with the possibility of extending into wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .

stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .

i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .
top drawer tourist site full of treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the lvr building the cologne cathedral was added to the world heritage list in 1996 and is one of the country 's top tourist draws .
the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .
new sites up for consideration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as passing judgment on the cologne cathedral , the whc will consider 28 cultural sites , 10 natural sites and four mixed sites presented by 44 countries , including albania , china and host country south africa as possible additions to unesco 's world heritage list . four countries - bahrain , bosnia-herzegovina , gabon and moldova - could see one of their sites join the list for the first time , a committee statement read . the durban meeting is the first whc session held in the sub-saharan africa since 1972 , when unesco approved a convention concerning the protection of the world 's cultural and natural heritage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne angered by unesco criticism cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

" we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .

in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .

they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .

nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .

" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .

a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .

the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .

in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .
top drawer tourist site full of treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the lvr building the cologne cathedral was added to the world heritage list in 1996 and is one of the country 's top tourist draws .
the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .
new sites up for consideration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as passing judgment on the cologne cathedral , the whc will consider 28 cultural sites , 10 natural sites and four mixed sites presented by 44 countries , including albania , china and host country south africa as possible additions to unesco 's world heritage list . four countries - bahrain , bosnia-herzegovina , gabon and moldova - could see one of their sites join the list for the first time , a committee statement read . the durban meeting is the first whc session held in the sub-saharan africa since 1972 , when unesco approved a convention concerning the protection of the world 's cultural and natural heritage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne angered by unesco criticism cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic .

approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .

germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

despite its myriad problems , it remains the world 's leading exporter and foreign demand for high-quality german goods has helped offset the slumping domestic economy . jürgen winkler , a professor of political science at the university of mainz , said a new of government could help germans regain confidence in the country 's future .

bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .
the party 's leader said that the spd would wage its campaign under the motto " trust in germany . "
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .
but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .

their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .

just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .

that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .

bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .
several months before the murder he directed a short film called " submission , " which was critical of abuses against women under islam . a letter was left on his body that included quotations from the koran and threats to several dutch politicians , including somali-born lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali who wrote the script for " submission . " bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .
the assassination caused a surge in ethnic tension in the netherlands and a wave of over 150 reprisal attacks on mosques , islamic schools and churches followed . bouyeri is charged with murdering van gogh , attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders and obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament .
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison .
under dutch law a life sentence is applied in the literal sense . even though prosecutors have said that bouyeri was " a leading figure " in a terrorist organization known as the hofstad group he has not yet been charged in that connection as they do not have sufficient evidence . possible second trial on terrorist charges monday 's trial will therefore only focus on van gogh 's murder and related events .
under the dutch legal system , bouyeri could be separately tried later for membership in a terrorist organization . security was tight around the courtroom with a sniffer dog checking the building and its surroundings for bombs and all visitors and media thoroughly searched . the court has set two days for the trial , with the possibility of extending into wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .
despite all efforts , he said , " the status quo could be maintained " in the security council , " and that would be tragic .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .

but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .
pakistan does not want india to get a permanent seat ; mexico is lobbying against brazil ; and italy does not want germany in a permanent chair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister natwar singh the indian foreign minister natwar singh -lrb- photo -rrb- admitted on monday that the competing plans could mean the g-4 fails in its goal to expand the council .
despite all efforts , he said , " the status quo could be maintained " in the security council , " and that would be tragic .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2005 can serbia face the past ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several former serbian leaders are still at large monday marks the 10th anniversary of the srebrenica massacre , when serbian forces killed about 8,000 muslims during the bosnian war .
observers in germany say serbia 's future hinges on a readiness to take responsibility . " when condemning crimes , it is of decisive importance not to distinguish between innocent victims according to their nationality or faith .
the serbian government strongly condemns all war crimes committed during the civil war in the former yugoslavia . " in this recent statement , belgrade did not single out the srebrenica massacre as the worst war crime committed on european soil since the end of world war ii as many had hoped .
instead , it called it a " serious crime " along with atrocities against ethnic serbs during the war . it 's a sign that the balkan country is still struggling to come to terms with its past despite recent signs that the war 's worst criminals might finally be brought to justice . us officials recently voiced their conviction that ratko mladic , the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , would spend the anniversary in prison awaiting trial before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
mladic and bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic have evaded arrest for a decade . changing public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of srebrenica massacre displayed in an abandoned hall near srebrenica , on july 10 , 2004 .
the recent broadcast of a graphic video showing serb paramilitaries killing muslims on serbian television also led to a change in opinion among the population : in a survey , a majority backed the extradition of war criminals for the first time . arresting karadzic and mladic is crucial for serbia 's future and possible eu membership , according to observers in germany , where about 700,000 serbs make up the second largest group of immigrants , behind turks . " serbia has extradited some war criminals to the hague , but not the two most important ones , " said milan kosanovic , who teaches eastern european history at the university of bonn and runs a foundation that aims to strengthen scientific and cultural ties between germany and serbia . " that 's the real problem , " he said , adding that the failure to send karadzic and mladic to the hague was symptomatic of serbia 's split view of the war . a need for testimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures next to them , some of the dozens found by the expert commission for pow 's and missing persons near srebrenica .
" many people say they did n't know what was happening - despite the proof , despite the mass graves , despite the thousands of witnesses who survived , " said bosiljka schedlich , a croatian who runs a berlin organization that promotes dialogue between different ethnic groups in the balkans . " it would be a very important thing for the serbs to have these men testify what they did , " schedlich said , adding that the current situation in serbia is similar to the situation in germany a decade after world war ii . " people still have to find themselves , but unlike in postwar germany , it 's not clear where things are going , " she said .
" a united europe is the only thing that can be offered to the people there .
it 's the light at the end of the tunnel . " setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- with german chancellor gerhard schröder in may others pointed to serbian leaders ' willingness to take more responsibility as witnessed by serbian president boris tadic 's decision to attend monday 's ceremony in srebrenica . " it 's important to set an example : ' we 're ready to admit our guilt irrespective of what the other side does , " ' said dusan vasiljevic , a dentist in northwestern germany who heads the german branch of tadic 's democratic party and served as an advisor to serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica during his time as yugoslav president . but when asked about the importance of the arrests of karadzic and mladic for serbia 's future , vasiljevic said there was a difference between the two men . " karadzic is not a serbian problem , he 's a bosnian problem , " he said , adding that the former psychologist and poet is not a citizen of serbia and montenegro .
" mladic has both citizenships and kostunica has clearly said that he should be in prison by september .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .

after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .
king 's cross station , north london , lies at the epicenter of the bombings on underground trains and a bus , and it has drawn hundreds of mourners from all walks of life to unite in their sorrow . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

observers in germany say serbia 's future hinges on a readiness to take responsibility . " when condemning crimes , it is of decisive importance not to distinguish between innocent victims according to their nationality or faith .
the serbian government strongly condemns all war crimes committed during the civil war in the former yugoslavia . " in this recent statement , belgrade did not single out the srebrenica massacre as the worst war crime committed on european soil since the end of world war ii as many had hoped .
instead , it called it a " serious crime " along with atrocities against ethnic serbs during the war . it 's a sign that the balkan country is still struggling to come to terms with its past despite recent signs that the war 's worst criminals might finally be brought to justice . us officials recently voiced their conviction that ratko mladic , the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , would spend the anniversary in prison awaiting trial before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
mladic and bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic have evaded arrest for a decade . changing public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of srebrenica massacre displayed in an abandoned hall near srebrenica , on july 10 , 2004 .
the recent broadcast of a graphic video showing serb paramilitaries killing muslims on serbian television also led to a change in opinion among the population : in a survey , a majority backed the extradition of war criminals for the first time . arresting karadzic and mladic is crucial for serbia 's future and possible eu membership , according to observers in germany , where about 700,000 serbs make up the second largest group of immigrants , behind turks . " serbia has extradited some war criminals to the hague , but not the two most important ones , " said milan kosanovic , who teaches eastern european history at the university of bonn and runs a foundation that aims to strengthen scientific and cultural ties between germany and serbia . " that 's the real problem , " he said , adding that the failure to send karadzic and mladic to the hague was symptomatic of serbia 's split view of the war . a need for testimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures next to them , some of the dozens found by the expert commission for pow 's and missing persons near srebrenica .
" many people say they did n't know what was happening - despite the proof , despite the mass graves , despite the thousands of witnesses who survived , " said bosiljka schedlich , a croatian who runs a berlin organization that promotes dialogue between different ethnic groups in the balkans . " it would be a very important thing for the serbs to have these men testify what they did , " schedlich said , adding that the current situation in serbia is similar to the situation in germany a decade after world war ii . " people still have to find themselves , but unlike in postwar germany , it 's not clear where things are going , " she said .
" a united europe is the only thing that can be offered to the people there .
it 's the light at the end of the tunnel . " setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- with german chancellor gerhard schröder in may others pointed to serbian leaders ' willingness to take more responsibility as witnessed by serbian president boris tadic 's decision to attend monday 's ceremony in srebrenica . " it 's important to set an example : ' we 're ready to admit our guilt irrespective of what the other side does , " ' said dusan vasiljevic , a dentist in northwestern germany who heads the german branch of tadic 's democratic party and served as an advisor to serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica during his time as yugoslav president . but when asked about the importance of the arrests of karadzic and mladic for serbia 's future , vasiljevic said there was a difference between the two men . " karadzic is not a serbian problem , he 's a bosnian problem , " he said , adding that the former psychologist and poet is not a citizen of serbia and montenegro .
" mladic has both citizenships and kostunica has clearly said that he should be in prison by september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2005 van gogh trial opens under high security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh 's murder shocked holland and caused ethnic tensions the trial of mohammed bouyeri , a moroccan dutch national accused of the murder of dutch filmmaker theo van gogh , opened monday at a high security court in amsterdam .
bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .
several months before the murder he directed a short film called " submission , " which was critical of abuses against women under islam . a letter was left on his body that included quotations from the koran and threats to several dutch politicians , including somali-born lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali who wrote the script for " submission . " bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .
the assassination caused a surge in ethnic tension in the netherlands and a wave of over 150 reprisal attacks on mosques , islamic schools and churches followed . bouyeri is charged with murdering van gogh , attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders and obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament .
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison .
under dutch law a life sentence is applied in the literal sense . even though prosecutors have said that bouyeri was " a leading figure " in a terrorist organization known as the hofstad group he has not yet been charged in that connection as they do not have sufficient evidence . possible second trial on terrorist charges monday 's trial will therefore only focus on van gogh 's murder and related events .
under the dutch legal system , bouyeri could be separately tried later for membership in a terrorist organization . security was tight around the courtroom with a sniffer dog checking the building and its surroundings for bombs and all visitors and media thoroughly searched . the court has set two days for the trial , with the possibility of extending into wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2005 london calling : cell phones may aid police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they need to spell it out ?
' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .

investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .
but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .
but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2005 can serbia face the past ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several former serbian leaders are still at large monday marks the 10th anniversary of the srebrenica massacre , when serbian forces killed about 8,000 muslims during the bosnian war .
observers in germany say serbia 's future hinges on a readiness to take responsibility . " when condemning crimes , it is of decisive importance not to distinguish between innocent victims according to their nationality or faith .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : germany left behind opinion : greens must learn to let go opinion : germany 's difficult path germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 the german fear of reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can merkel help germany get its groove back ?
germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .
" i 'm doing relatively okay , i ca n't complain .
but i 'm not very optimistic about the future . " aggravated by unification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's current woes have undoubtedly been aggravated by the challenges arising from german reunification in 1990 .
approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .
it is a view shared by many long-time spd supporters . " i 'm done with the social democrats , they 're no longer the party of the workers , " said joachim wolf , an out-of-work mechanic from eastern berlin .
" it 's all about what 's best for big business these days . " fear of globalization wolf , who spends his days playing cards with friends at a makeshift table in a dreary corner shop , expressed a deep-seated aversion to globalization and fear about what growing international competition might mean for working-class germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's busy harbor ironically , germany probably stands to gain more than most countries from globalization .
despite its myriad problems , it remains the world 's leading exporter and foreign demand for high-quality german goods has helped offset the slumping domestic economy . jürgen winkler , a professor of political science at the university of mainz , said a new of government could help germans regain confidence in the country 's future .
" schröder has been there for seven years , it 's probably time for change , " he said .
" you do n't even have to support the cdu to see it could help encourage an atmosphere that things are no longer simply stagnating . " and that could help merkel push through unpopular measures aimed at sparking job creation , such as raising taxes to lower the deficit , or weakening job protection measures and laws that mandate worker consultation at companies .
though unlikely to rejoice over such policies , many germans now appear convinced things ca n't continue as they are . " a lot of people are very disappointed , " said the commuting banker , kaule .
" perhaps we should have started the reforms much earlier . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business hails early election investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .
" i 'm doing relatively okay , i ca n't complain .
but i 'm not very optimistic about the future . " aggravated by unification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's current woes have undoubtedly been aggravated by the challenges arising from german reunification in 1990 .
approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .
it is a view shared by many long-time spd supporters . " i 'm done with the social democrats , they 're no longer the party of the workers , " said joachim wolf , an out-of-work mechanic from eastern berlin .
" it 's all about what 's best for big business these days . " fear of globalization wolf , who spends his days playing cards with friends at a makeshift table in a dreary corner shop , expressed a deep-seated aversion to globalization and fear about what growing international competition might mean for working-class germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's busy harbor ironically , germany probably stands to gain more than most countries from globalization .
despite its myriad problems , it remains the world 's leading exporter and foreign demand for high-quality german goods has helped offset the slumping domestic economy . jürgen winkler , a professor of political science at the university of mainz , said a new of government could help germans regain confidence in the country 's future .
" schröder has been there for seven years , it 's probably time for change , " he said .
" you do n't even have to support the cdu to see it could help encourage an atmosphere that things are no longer simply stagnating . " and that could help merkel push through unpopular measures aimed at sparking job creation , such as raising taxes to lower the deficit , or weakening job protection measures and laws that mandate worker consultation at companies .
though unlikely to rejoice over such policies , many germans now appear convinced things ca n't continue as they are . " a lot of people are very disappointed , " said the commuting banker , kaule .
" perhaps we should have started the reforms much earlier . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business hails early election investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .

meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .
top drawer tourist site full of treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the lvr building the cologne cathedral was added to the world heritage list in 1996 and is one of the country 's top tourist draws .
the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .
new sites up for consideration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as passing judgment on the cologne cathedral , the whc will consider 28 cultural sites , 10 natural sites and four mixed sites presented by 44 countries , including albania , china and host country south africa as possible additions to unesco 's world heritage list . four countries - bahrain , bosnia-herzegovina , gabon and moldova - could see one of their sites join the list for the first time , a committee statement read . the durban meeting is the first whc session held in the sub-saharan africa since 1972 , when unesco approved a convention concerning the protection of the world 's cultural and natural heritage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne angered by unesco criticism cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .

it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .
top drawer tourist site full of treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the lvr building the cologne cathedral was added to the world heritage list in 1996 and is one of the country 's top tourist draws .
the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .
new sites up for consideration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as passing judgment on the cologne cathedral , the whc will consider 28 cultural sites , 10 natural sites and four mixed sites presented by 44 countries , including albania , china and host country south africa as possible additions to unesco 's world heritage list . four countries - bahrain , bosnia-herzegovina , gabon and moldova - could see one of their sites join the list for the first time , a committee statement read . the durban meeting is the first whc session held in the sub-saharan africa since 1972 , when unesco approved a convention concerning the protection of the world 's cultural and natural heritage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne angered by unesco criticism cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .
but the landmark could be stripped of its special status because of the city 's lofty building plans .
-lrb- july 10 , 2004 -rrb- cologne cathedral on unesco danger list cologne 's magnificent gothic cathedral has been placed on unesco 's list of world heritage in danger due to the increasing development of the german city 's skyline .
-lrb- july 6 , 2004 -rrb- germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .
" i 'm doing relatively okay , i ca n't complain .
but i 'm not very optimistic about the future . " aggravated by unification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's current woes have undoubtedly been aggravated by the challenges arising from german reunification in 1990 .
approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .
it is a view shared by many long-time spd supporters . " i 'm done with the social democrats , they 're no longer the party of the workers , " said joachim wolf , an out-of-work mechanic from eastern berlin .
" it 's all about what 's best for big business these days . " fear of globalization wolf , who spends his days playing cards with friends at a makeshift table in a dreary corner shop , expressed a deep-seated aversion to globalization and fear about what growing international competition might mean for working-class germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's busy harbor ironically , germany probably stands to gain more than most countries from globalization .
despite its myriad problems , it remains the world 's leading exporter and foreign demand for high-quality german goods has helped offset the slumping domestic economy . jürgen winkler , a professor of political science at the university of mainz , said a new of government could help germans regain confidence in the country 's future .
" schröder has been there for seven years , it 's probably time for change , " he said .
" you do n't even have to support the cdu to see it could help encourage an atmosphere that things are no longer simply stagnating . " and that could help merkel push through unpopular measures aimed at sparking job creation , such as raising taxes to lower the deficit , or weakening job protection measures and laws that mandate worker consultation at companies .
though unlikely to rejoice over such policies , many germans now appear convinced things ca n't continue as they are . " a lot of people are very disappointed , " said the commuting banker , kaule .
" perhaps we should have started the reforms much earlier . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business hails early election investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition .
-lrb- may 24 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : what germany needs as germany heads toward early elections this fall , voters will decide whether they want chancellor gerhard schröder or opposition leader angela merkel .
but dw-world 's marc young is n't sure if germans know what they need .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

despite its myriad problems , it remains the world 's leading exporter and foreign demand for high-quality german goods has helped offset the slumping domestic economy . jürgen winkler , a professor of political science at the university of mainz , said a new of government could help germans regain confidence in the country 's future .
" schröder has been there for seven years , it 's probably time for change , " he said .
" you do n't even have to support the cdu to see it could help encourage an atmosphere that things are no longer simply stagnating . " and that could help merkel push through unpopular measures aimed at sparking job creation , such as raising taxes to lower the deficit , or weakening job protection measures and laws that mandate worker consultation at companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : germany left behind opinion : greens must learn to let go opinion : germany 's difficult path germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 the german fear of reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can merkel help germany get its groove back ?
germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .
" i 'm doing relatively okay , i ca n't complain .
but i 'm not very optimistic about the future . " aggravated by unification bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's current woes have undoubtedly been aggravated by the challenges arising from german reunification in 1990 .
approximately 1.25 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 trillion -rrb- have been spent rebuilding what was once communist east germany over the past 15 years .
despite the massive transfers of aid , the region is still struggling and unemployment is double that in the more prosperous west . yet germany 's standard of living remains remarkably high and an extensive social safety net ensures there is virtually none of the abject poverty seen in some industrialized countries such as the united states .
however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .
it is a view shared by many long-time spd supporters . " i 'm done with the social democrats , they 're no longer the party of the workers , " said joachim wolf , an out-of-work mechanic from eastern berlin .
" it 's all about what 's best for big business these days . " fear of globalization wolf , who spends his days playing cards with friends at a makeshift table in a dreary corner shop , expressed a deep-seated aversion to globalization and fear about what growing international competition might mean for working-class germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's busy harbor ironically , germany probably stands to gain more than most countries from globalization .
despite its myriad problems , it remains the world 's leading exporter and foreign demand for high-quality german goods has helped offset the slumping domestic economy . jürgen winkler , a professor of political science at the university of mainz , said a new of government could help germans regain confidence in the country 's future .
" schröder has been there for seven years , it 's probably time for change , " he said .
" you do n't even have to support the cdu to see it could help encourage an atmosphere that things are no longer simply stagnating . " and that could help merkel push through unpopular measures aimed at sparking job creation , such as raising taxes to lower the deficit , or weakening job protection measures and laws that mandate worker consultation at companies .
though unlikely to rejoice over such policies , many germans now appear convinced things ca n't continue as they are . " a lot of people are very disappointed , " said the commuting banker , kaule .
" perhaps we should have started the reforms much earlier . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business hails early election investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition .

observers in germany say serbia 's future hinges on a readiness to take responsibility . " when condemning crimes , it is of decisive importance not to distinguish between innocent victims according to their nationality or faith .
the serbian government strongly condemns all war crimes committed during the civil war in the former yugoslavia . " in this recent statement , belgrade did not single out the srebrenica massacre as the worst war crime committed on european soil since the end of world war ii as many had hoped .
instead , it called it a " serious crime " along with atrocities against ethnic serbs during the war . it 's a sign that the balkan country is still struggling to come to terms with its past despite recent signs that the war 's worst criminals might finally be brought to justice . us officials recently voiced their conviction that ratko mladic , the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , would spend the anniversary in prison awaiting trial before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
mladic and bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic have evaded arrest for a decade . changing public opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of srebrenica massacre displayed in an abandoned hall near srebrenica , on july 10 , 2004 .
the recent broadcast of a graphic video showing serb paramilitaries killing muslims on serbian television also led to a change in opinion among the population : in a survey , a majority backed the extradition of war criminals for the first time . arresting karadzic and mladic is crucial for serbia 's future and possible eu membership , according to observers in germany , where about 700,000 serbs make up the second largest group of immigrants , behind turks . " serbia has extradited some war criminals to the hague , but not the two most important ones , " said milan kosanovic , who teaches eastern european history at the university of bonn and runs a foundation that aims to strengthen scientific and cultural ties between germany and serbia . " that 's the real problem , " he said , adding that the failure to send karadzic and mladic to the hague was symptomatic of serbia 's split view of the war . a need for testimony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of two skulls with family pictures next to them , some of the dozens found by the expert commission for pow 's and missing persons near srebrenica .
" many people say they did n't know what was happening - despite the proof , despite the mass graves , despite the thousands of witnesses who survived , " said bosiljka schedlich , a croatian who runs a berlin organization that promotes dialogue between different ethnic groups in the balkans . " it would be a very important thing for the serbs to have these men testify what they did , " schedlich said , adding that the current situation in serbia is similar to the situation in germany a decade after world war ii . " people still have to find themselves , but unlike in postwar germany , it 's not clear where things are going , " she said .
" a united europe is the only thing that can be offered to the people there .
it 's the light at the end of the tunnel . " setting examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic -lrb- left -rrb- with german chancellor gerhard schröder in may others pointed to serbian leaders ' willingness to take more responsibility as witnessed by serbian president boris tadic 's decision to attend monday 's ceremony in srebrenica . " it 's important to set an example : ' we 're ready to admit our guilt irrespective of what the other side does , " ' said dusan vasiljevic , a dentist in northwestern germany who heads the german branch of tadic 's democratic party and served as an advisor to serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica during his time as yugoslav president . but when asked about the importance of the arrests of karadzic and mladic for serbia 's future , vasiljevic said there was a difference between the two men . " karadzic is not a serbian problem , he 's a bosnian problem , " he said , adding that the former psychologist and poet is not a citizen of serbia and montenegro .
" mladic has both citizenships and kostunica has clearly said that he should be in prison by september .

bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .
several months before the murder he directed a short film called " submission , " which was critical of abuses against women under islam . a letter was left on his body that included quotations from the koran and threats to several dutch politicians , including somali-born lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali who wrote the script for " submission . " bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .
the assassination caused a surge in ethnic tension in the netherlands and a wave of over 150 reprisal attacks on mosques , islamic schools and churches followed . bouyeri is charged with murdering van gogh , attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders and obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament .
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison .
under dutch law a life sentence is applied in the literal sense . even though prosecutors have said that bouyeri was " a leading figure " in a terrorist organization known as the hofstad group he has not yet been charged in that connection as they do not have sufficient evidence . possible second trial on terrorist charges monday 's trial will therefore only focus on van gogh 's murder and related events .
under the dutch legal system , bouyeri could be separately tried later for membership in a terrorist organization . security was tight around the courtroom with a sniffer dog checking the building and its surroundings for bombs and all visitors and media thoroughly searched . the court has set two days for the trial , with the possibility of extending into wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

one of the injured who was sitting nearby said that he had seen two people drop a black nylon bag in to the bin about 30 minutes before the blast .
television reports described the bomb as a simple home-made device . cesme , on the aegean sea , is a popular resort among local turks , especially day-trippers from the nearby town of izmir . but it 's also frequented by foreign tourists , mainly germans , although the only two foreigners injured in this attack were said to be british and russian . foreigners injured " a briton was among the casualties and received minor injuries , " a spokeswoman from the ministry said after the blast on sunday .
" we understand he was later released from hospital , " the spokeswoman added , without revealing the injured man 's name . yusuf ziya goksu , the governor of the surrounding izmir province , was later quoted by the anatolia news agency as saying the briton was john willoughby , 63 , and the russian alexander danilik , 44 . militant arm of pkk claims responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group which has claimed responsibility , the kurdistan liberation hawks , or tak , is a militant offshoot of the kurdistan workers ' party , the pkk , which is banned in turkey .
the pkk 's leader abdullah öcalan -lrb- photo -rrb- is turkey 's most high-profile prisoner and his internment has been a further catalyst for escalations in violence . a person claiming to be from the group phoned the mezopotamya news agency , which is regarded as a mouthpiece for the pkk , and said that such attacks on tourist areas would continue . the agency said that the tak had warned the authorities before the blast .
the tak has carried out several attacks since august last year , mostly in tourist resorts .
it has called on foreigners not to visit turkey , in an attempt to damage the tourism industry which is the country 's largest foreign currency earner , producing around 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 16 billion -rrb- last year from 17.5 million foreign tourists . battle for independence in the 15 years of the pkk 's war against the turkish state 36,000 people have died in the organization 's attempt to win independence for the kurdish areas of the country .
the pkk declared a unilateral ceasefire in 1999 , but called off the truce last year . the organization has now stepped up its military campaign , with 50 turkish soldiers having been killed in the last month . michael lawton -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu court deems ocalan trial unfair the european court of human rights in strasbourg ruled thursday that turkey 's trial of kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan was unfair and in breach of the european convention on human rights .

" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .
several months before the murder he directed a short film called " submission , " which was critical of abuses against women under islam . a letter was left on his body that included quotations from the koran and threats to several dutch politicians , including somali-born lawmaker ayaan hirsi ali who wrote the script for " submission . " bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .
the assassination caused a surge in ethnic tension in the netherlands and a wave of over 150 reprisal attacks on mosques , islamic schools and churches followed . bouyeri is charged with murdering van gogh , attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders and obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament .
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison .
under dutch law a life sentence is applied in the literal sense . even though prosecutors have said that bouyeri was " a leading figure " in a terrorist organization known as the hofstad group he has not yet been charged in that connection as they do not have sufficient evidence . possible second trial on terrorist charges monday 's trial will therefore only focus on van gogh 's murder and related events .
under the dutch legal system , bouyeri could be separately tried later for membership in a terrorist organization . security was tight around the courtroom with a sniffer dog checking the building and its surroundings for bombs and all visitors and media thoroughly searched . the court has set two days for the trial , with the possibility of extending into wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch muslims threatened after killing following the assassination of a famous dutch filmmaker by a suspected muslim radical last week , tensions between the country and its muslim community have reached the boiling point .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .

stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .

" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .
king 's cross station , north london , lies at the epicenter of the bombings on underground trains and a bus , and it has drawn hundreds of mourners from all walks of life to unite in their sorrow . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .
but first they have to bid farewell to their initial effort at national power . jens thurau -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's greens face political wilderness germany 's environmentalist green party gathers this weekend in berlin to hammer out an election platform ahead of a likely national poll that is widely expected to cut short their first stint in the federal government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.07.2005 crunch time for cathedral 's heritage status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the lvr building blocks the view , unesco says the fate of cologne 's cathedral , a un-protected site since 1996 , will be decided this week .
unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "

' not afraid ' campaign is a media success as londoners began returning to work monday , police warned that staying staying would equal giving in to terrorists .
meanwhile , high tech looks set to play a big role in news coverage and the investigation . londoners were gritting their teeth as they returned to work monday even as police searched crumpled underground train wreckage for clues to track the terror bombers , spurred by fear of a new attack .
after a day of prayers for the victims , mingled with memories of world war ii heroism on the 60th anniversary of the conflict 's end on sunday , people descended into subway trains and rode the buses to work again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london underground train bombed at aldgate tube station most of the london underground system apart from the blast sites would be open , said andy trotter , deputy chief constable of the british transport police .
" we believe that with all the efforts of everyone involved , including londoners , we can defeat the terrorists .
by not coming to work , by london not being open for business , they will win .
and they are not going to win . "
stiff upper lips on monday morning , it appeared that commuters were indeed traveling into london by bus and subway , anxious but determined to press on with their lives at the start of the first working week since a barrage of bomb attacks on trains and a bus .
nerves are jangling as a result , but many businessmen and women - in true british stiff-upper-lip style - say they refuse to allow the threat of another atrocity to affect their daily life .
" i was a bit hesitant at first , but i have to use the tube to get to work , " said 20-year-old office worker daniel jakes .
" people were glaring at each other so i did feel a bit paranoid , " he admitted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : injured tube passengers at edgware road on thursday , july 7 cathy dunstan , a 35-year-old investment banker , said she had no hesitation about taking the underground , even though there was early-morning evidence of some commuters electing to head for work on their bikes .
" the journey was fine .
i was n't worried about getting on the tube , " said dunstan .
" these things happen , you 've just got to get on with life . "
police said 49 bodies had been hauled out of the four blast sites , a blown-apart number 30 double-decker bus and three london underground train tunnels , and they hoped to find no more .
high-tech in the limelight meanwhile british police appealed to the public for images taken at the sites of last week 's suspected al qaeda bomb attacks .
and investigators asked mobile phone and internet companies to store the content of voicemails , emails and sms text messages on the day of the bombings .
mobile phone footage captured seconds after the bomb attacks brought home the full horror of the carnage .
dozens of terrified passengers on the trains reached for their phones not just to call loved ones but also to record the terror virtually as it happened .
bildunterschrift : entry on wearenotafraid.com a host of television stations and news websites showed video and stills images of bloodied commuters desperately clawing their way to safety , or dazed bus passengers sprawled on the ground after the blast .
a clutch of media organizations from as far away as australia - which has several thousand nationals living in london - called on those caught up in the drama to email their pictures , and many responded .
one man , alex chadwick , took pictures of one of the attacks on the london underground with his mobile , capturing passengers covering their mouths as acrid smoke swirled around them .
another image showed a man nearby also using his handset to take pictures .
video footage showed blast survivors heading for the exit , exhorted by a london underground worker to " keep on moving down , please . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image taken on a mobile hone camera by victim alexander chadwick sky news put out an appeal for images and was contacted by people with mobile phone stills and videos , which they e-mailed to sky news teams , said the channel 's associate editor , simon bucks .
" this is eyewitness material seen as events are unfolding .
it is a democratization of news coverage , which in the past we would have only got to later , " bucks said .
bucks said it was inevitable that such mobile images would be increasingly used in major news events in the future .
" more and more people have phones with cameras , the technology is getting better , camera phones are becoming more powerful .
internet campaign a hit in addition , the public response from people who were not directly involved in the attacks has been overwhelming .
the internet sites wearnenotafraid.com , which aims to show solidarity with terror victims , was flooded with submissions after it asked users to send in photographs bearing the message , " we are not afraid . "
the three train blasts in london occurred on thursday within 50 seconds of one another at about 8:50 a.m. , a level of coordination that bore the hallmarks of an attack by suspected al-qaeda operatives .
there have been two claims of responsibility by groups linked to the organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a commuter reads a copy of the ' evening standard ' newspaper reporting the terror bomb explosions " i am confident that the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the end , " home secretary charles clarke told the bbc .
" our fear is of course of more attacks until we succeed in tracking down the gang that committed the atrocities on thursday , " clarke said .
investigators say they have already established that the bombers used a high explosive - they will not disclose further details - and that each device was lighter than 10 pounds -lrb- 4.5 kilograms -rrb- .
no inquiry planned prime minister tony blair insisted late sunday he would dismiss calls by opposition conservatives for an inquiry into the attacks , but would instead underline his confidence in the intelligence services .
meanwhile , a ring of human grief continued to grow around a tree close to the deadliest of last week 's bomb attacks in london , where bunches of flowers , toys , cards and candles commemorate the victims .
king 's cross station , north london , lies at the epicenter of the bombings on underground trains and a bus , and it has drawn hundreds of mourners from all walks of life to unite in their sorrow . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk police defend birmingham evacuation only days after deadly bomb attacks in london , some 20,000 people were evacuated from birmingham overnight saturday as police reacted to a " credible threat " to the central english city .

bouyeri has refused to offer a defense . bouyeri , whom prosecutors describe as a radical islamist , was present in court but his lawyer said he did not want to be defended .
he also refused to participate in his trial voluntarily but the court issued an order for him to be brought in regardless . bouyeri , 27 , came to court dressed in a long black shirt and a palestinian black and white checkered headscarf and carrying a green leather-bound book embossed with gold arabic script . his lawyer peter plasman announced he will not present a defense .
" it is my client 's wish that there will be no defense not by him but also not on his behalf ...
he will use his right to remain silent , " plasman said in a short statement . when judge udo willem bentinck asked plasman whether bouyeri 's refusal was connected to his beliefs the lawyer would not answer , but bentick said , " i see your client nodding . " plasman repeated that bouyeri " takes complete responsibility for his actions and that specifically means his actions on november 2 , 2004 , " the day van gogh was killed . born and raised in amsterdam , the 27-year-old bouyeri is a radical islamist who hoped to die a martyr after killing controversial filmmaker van gogh , a distant relative of 19th century painter vincent van gogh , police said . public execution-style murder shocked the nation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo van gogh theo van gogh , who was also a well-known columnist noted for his virulent attacks on multicultural society and islam , was shot and stabbed in broad daylight while he cycled on the streets of amsterdam .

" bouyeri was arrested as he was attempting to flee the murder scene , according to police . ethnic tensions escalated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters try to douse the flames at the bedir islamic elementary school in uden , the netherlands .
the fire at the school was suspected arson as part of a string of attacks in the netherlands in the wake of the killing of theo van gogh , a dutch filmmaker , allegedly by an islamic extremist .
the assassination caused a surge in ethnic tension in the netherlands and a wave of over 150 reprisal attacks on mosques , islamic schools and churches followed . bouyeri is charged with murdering van gogh , attempted murder of several police officers and bystanders and obstructing the work of hirsi ali as a member of parliament .
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum of life in prison .
under dutch law a life sentence is applied in the literal sense . even though prosecutors have said that bouyeri was " a leading figure " in a terrorist organization known as the hofstad group he has not yet been charged in that connection as they do not have sufficient evidence . possible second trial on terrorist charges monday 's trial will therefore only focus on van gogh 's murder and related events .

germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career . amid widespread discontent over record joblessness and increasing economic uncertainty in the age of globalization , merkel , the conservative opposition 's candidate to take on chancellor gerhard schröder in early national elections this fall , is hoping to convince germans she can help the country get back on track . " we have to become faster and more flexible if we want to compete internationally , " merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said last month in berlin outlining her upcoming campaign .
" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .
but success at the polls would also put her in charge at a time when europe 's largest economy is flagging and average germans are reluctant to back painful reform measures . psychological problems ? " as a rich and well educated country , germany has all the tools to be a smashing success , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the transatlantic think tank the aspen institute , in berlin .
" but there are serious structural problems and psychology has become one obstacle to change .
germany is in a bit of a funk . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic . " i 'm not sure -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- christian democrats have the answers to the problems either , " said ralf kaule , a 47-year-old banker who commutes from berlin to hamburg each week because he could n't find a job in his hometown .

however , that security comes at a price the country is finding ever more expensive to maintain . though schröder committed his center-left coalition of social democrats and environmentalist greens to a reform course in 2003 , he has been under constant pressure from left-wing members of his own party and angry trade unionists keen to roll back what they see as an effort to gut germany 's welfare state .

" we want things to start improving in germany again . " with the cdu riding high in opinion polls , the 50-year-old merkel looks set to become both the first woman and the first person from the formerly communist eastern part of the country to lead germany .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder schröder opted to push germany 's next general election forward by a year after his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was hammered in a key state election last month .
the defeat in the party 's regional stronghold north rhine-westphalia was the latest in a string of losses that germans have used to punish schröder for scaling back germany 's generous welfare state and failing to revive the economy . the government 's unpopular measures to cut social benefits while implementing labor market reforms have failed to dent germany 's chronically high unemployment , which currently hovers at 12 percent .
the expansion of the european union last year to include much of eastern europe has also heightened fears that the country will lose even more jobs to germany 's low-wage neighbors such as poland and the czech republic .

" schröder has been there for seven years , it 's probably time for change , " he said .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd presents election manifesto germany 's ruling social democrats have presented their election manifesto for upcoming national elections .
the party 's leader said that the spd would wage its campaign under the motto " trust in germany . "
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

the troubled red-green legacy germany -pipe- 11.07.2005 conservatives unveil election platform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and edmund stoiber present their plan for the future the conservative union bloc of parties has released its election platform for the anticipated federal ballot in september .
it 's aimed at boosting the stagnant german economy , but some say it does n't go far enough . german president horst köhler has n't even given his approval for new elections in the fall , nor have the conservatives won it .
but , but that did n't stop the union bloc from naming its election platform released on monday the " governing program 2005-2009 . "
it 's a platform the center right says will help them unseat chancellor schröder and heal the " sick man of europe , " a name often given to germany over the past few years due to an economy that can not get on its feet . the conservative bloc , consisting of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the bavarian christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , has laid out a business-friendly program that seeks to cut labor costs and ease rules on hiring and firing employees . angela merkel , head of the cdu and widely expected to beat german chancellor gerhard schröder in a fall election , appears to want to make her mark as a reformer willing to make the tough choices that chancellor gerhard schröder has sometimes been reluctant to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister lady margaret thatcher while the reforms laid out in the document are not as radical as the program of former british prime minister margaret thatcher -lrb- photo -rrb- - whom merkel is often compared to - they have been generally well received by the business community and economists . " the program … by the cdu is not a great leap .
but it is realistic and credible , " said an editorial in the financial times deutschland . tax hike , relief at the center of the program is a planned two percent increase in the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , from 16 to 18 percent , which would raise an additional 16 billion euros -lrb- $ 19 billion -rrb- .
that money would be used to cover the shortfall expected after a planned lowering of unemployment benefit contributions , or non-wage labor costs , paid by workers and employers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all are happy with the prospect of raising sales tax , since consumer consumption is weak in germany and higher taxes run the risk of scaring away already nervous consumers .
big retailers like department-store chain karstadtquelle and metro are concerned a vat increase may further dent sales that have been falling for four years straight .
but cdu general-secretary volker kauder said on german television that there was little choice . " we have decided to cut non-wage labor costs to boost jobs and we can only do that by raising value-added tax so we can act quickly , " he said . fewer loopholes , subsidies the cdu / csu also plans to lower the top personal income tax rate to 39 percent from 42 percent and the bottom rate from 15 percent to 12 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cuts will be financed by cutting subsidies for first-time home buyers and tax breaks for commuters and for bonuses paid for working on sundays , holidays and on night shifts . while the governing social democrats have talked about instigating a wealth tax if re-elected , the conservatives are arguing for closing loopholes high-earners enjoy , such as restricting the possibility of writing off losses incurred by some investment firms . the opposition has backed off from earlier talk about a major reform of germany 's complicated tax system or of reforming the federal structure that many blame for hindering reform in the country .
the tax cut plans announced monday are smaller than those announced in march 2004 , when the parties pledged tax relief of around 11 billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- . labor-market reform under a conservative government , it would be easier for small and medium-sized firms to hire and fire workers .
for new hires , legal protection against unlawful dismissal would be suspended for companies with 20 workers or fewer .
the measure is intended to make companies more willing to take on new staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rules would also be put in place making it easier for companies to take on temporary workers .
more support would be given for part-time work for people bringing up children or providing nursing care . the program would make it possible for companies to deviate from sector-wide wage contracts , currently the norm on the german industrial landscape .
firms and workers could agree deals on pay and conditions at the company level . foreign policy on the foreign policy front , a priority of a merkel-led government would be to revitalize germany 's relationship with the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traditionally close ties between the transatlantic allies have been severely tested due to germany 's strong and vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq . " a good transatlantic relationship of trust does not exclude differences of opinion but is based on cooperative dialogue in the spirit of friendship instead of on polemical insults , " the document says . the conservatives also say they would work to strengthen nato and increase the eu 's military capability .
they want to apply eu budget rules to the letter , but also support a frugal eu budget that takes into account germany 's limited capacity .
germany is the largest contributor to the eu budget . the cdu / csu would campaign for a so-called " privileged partnership " for turkey instead of full eu membership and only take in new eu members , such as bulgaria and romania , who strictly meet entry criteria set out by brussels . far enough ? while the platform was generally met with approval from the business world , some economists questioned whether it went far enough to tackle some of germany 's more entrenched problems . some have criticized the fact that the program does not address the problem of germany 's large public debt and say it does not go far enough in slashing subsidies . " i would actually have thought that a program like this would contain proposals for cutting spending , " alfred boss , an economist at the kiel-based ifw economics institute , told reuters . even the conservatives ' main ally and possible future coalition partner , the liberal free democrats , were critical of some points of the platform , particularly the vat hike .
the party 's leader , guido westerwelle , told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday that there was still a lot of discussion needed to bring the union bloc back to " the path of free-enterprise rationality .

the serbian government strongly condemns all war crimes committed during the civil war in the former yugoslavia . " in this recent statement , belgrade did not single out the srebrenica massacre as the worst war crime committed on european soil since the end of world war ii as many had hoped .
instead , it called it a " serious crime " along with atrocities against ethnic serbs during the war . it 's a sign that the balkan country is still struggling to come to terms with its past despite recent signs that the war 's worst criminals might finally be brought to justice . us officials recently voiced their conviction that ratko mladic , the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , would spend the anniversary in prison awaiting trial before the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .

in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .

germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters . discussions are starting in earnest this week on expanding the united nations security council .
while almost everyone agrees that the body should be enlarged , there is much less agreement on how that should happen or what a new , improved council should look like . germany ’ s united nations envoy gunter pleuger said last wednesday that the so-called group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- countries - germany , brazil , india and japan - planned to call for a debate of their plan in the general assembly this week .
but a rival plan agreed on by african leaders at an african union summit in libya last week is likely to frustrate the g-4 bid . the g-4 resolution , already delayed twice , would enlarge the council to 25 members .
the proposal wants to add ten new seats .
there would be six new permanent ones – two for asia , two for africa and one each for western europe and latin america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer speaks with gunter pleuger , german ambassador to the united nations in addition they want four new non-permanent seats , including one for africa .
the plan also includes a pledge by the four new permanent members not to use veto rights in the council .
envoy pleuger -lrb- photo , right -rrb- has shown himself confident that the g-4 draft will find support in united nations ' general assembly . " we are in close contact with all united nations members and with various national governments , " he said .
" and i can say that support is growing for our resolution . " rival african plan however , the hopes of the g-4 have been dented by the african union , which has put forward a rival plan which aims to give africa a greater say in the un security council .
african leaders will now ask the united nations for africa to be allocated two permanent seats with full veto powers and the number of new non-permanent members to be increased by six . bildunterschrift : participants attending the opening of the 5th ordinary session of the assembly of the african union at the african union summit monday july 4 , 2005 in sirte , libya the african union was unable to decide on the countries it wants to have permanent seats , but south africa , nigeria and egypt are said to be leading candidates . thomas steg , a spokesman for the german government , denies that the african union plan will thwart the g-4 's attempts to reach a vote in the world body quickly . " the two plans match each other because the g-4 has always insisted on a greater role to be given to african countries , " he said .
" there is full agreement on this issue and i ’ m sure we will be able to work out the details in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the general assembly at un headquarters without africa ’ s 53 votes in the general assembly -lrb- photo -rrb- , the g-4 draft resolution will not reach the 128 or two-thirds majority it needs .
in addition the group faces strong opposition from the united states , russia and china which would prefer to delay enlargement . yet another plan throwing another spanner in the works for the g-4 is the plan put forward by italy , spain mexico and pakistan .
they want to expand the council , but only with non-permanent seats . according to pakistan 's un ambassador munir akram , the security council is already flawed by having five permanent seats and his allies do n't want to compound the problem by adding new permanent members .
he says such a plan discriminates against those countries which do not have a permanent representation on the body . just a few hours before the debate in new york was to begin , german foreign minister joschka fischer and his italian counterpart gianfranco fini , meeting in rome , said they could not come to an agreement on their countries ' divergent security council wishes . " as friends , we have very different positions , " fischer said . it is an open secret that regional rivalries also play a part in this competing security council plan .

for the first time , germany 's greens have put the economy above ecology on their political agenda .
but more than that , they must learn to bid farewell to power . germany 's consumer affairs minister renate künast said her green party was dumbstruck when german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on may 22 that he would seek early elections in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer affairs minister renate künast addressing the party congress in berlin on sunday , künast spoke from the bottom of her heart . künast moaned that the red-green coalition government - between the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and her party , the greens , - still had so much they wanted to accomplish .
now , seven weeks after schröder began his " panicked race to new elections , " as one green party delegate referred to the chancellor 's early election bid , the greens are showing themselves reluctant to give up power .
over the past seven years , the once-alternative ecology party has morphed so completely into a governing party that it can hardly believe there soon wo n't be greens governing at the state or national levels .
yet if opinion polls are to be believed , the outlook for another red-green coalition in the near future is highly unlikely .
only 15 percent of voters support it .
but that did n't stop a feisty green party foreign minister joschka fischer from crying out - well , practically yelling at the top of his lungs - for victory during the party congress .
victory was his focus , he said .
of course he would continue to seek it - even with the perfidious spd , who else ? - even though they had thrown in the towel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer now , accusing the greens of clinging to power against all odds is not entirely fair .
their popularity in the polls is stable ; even the chancellor recently admitted -lrb- quietly of course -rrb- that his spd party was the one responsible for bringing the government to its knees .
thus the greens defend the red-green platform more strongly than do the social democrats .
this is made partiucularly clear by the greens ' newly announced political platforms , which for the first time ever put economic measures at the top of their agenda .
the platforms include altering the debated workplace reforms , as well as increased taxes for the very wealthy .
but the heart of the reforms was correct , the greens said .
just as it was correct to support renewable energies , to promote the phasing out of atomic energy , to push for the reform of citizenship laws and the ecology tax .
basically , to hear them tell it , everything the greens have done thus far was ... right .
who is to blame ?
of course , the greens do n't want to see their first efforts at governance badmouthed .
add to this the fact that it was their first shot at power , and that an entire generation had waited for them to come to power , and it becomes clear how difficult it is to take objective stock of their achievements .
it is even more difficult to look to the future - quickly , and without nostalgia .
but one thing gets passed over when politicians behave in such a self-confident , defiant manner .
that is , the admission that they failed - as much as the spd did - when it came to tackling the country 's biggest problem , mass unemployment .
they took part in cobbling together the patchwork social reforms , and the citizens have had enough of it .
the greens owe it to their voters to keep ecological projects a high priority in their platform .
they owe it to the country to finally take important economic questions seriously .
can they do it ?
the chances are n't so bad , in the long term .

unesco will decide if new skyscrapers compromise the site enough to remove it from the prestigious list . members of the world heritage committee -lrb- whc -rrb- , the united nation 's body responsible for the conservation of global heritage sites , gathered in durban , south africa on monday for its annual meeting , during which it will consider 42 proposed sites for inscription on the prestigious world heritage list .
it will also assess the case for removal of one of germany 's icons - cologne 's historic cathedral . at the whc 's last annual meeting , in the eastern chinese city of suzhou in april 2004 , the cathedral , which is widely regarded as being one of europe 's masterpieces of gothic architecture , was placed on the un 's educational , scientific and cultural organization 's -lrb- unesco -rrb- list of world heritage in danger , because its integrity was said to be threatened by skyscrapers . the decision gave the cathedral the unwanted distinction of being the only european site on the list . " the cologne cathedral and its urban landscape are the city 's only outstanding cultural heritage elements to have survived world war ii , " francesco bandarin , director of unesco 's world heritage center , said in a statement in april .
" i sincerely hope that cologne will not lose an important component of its historical legacy . "
offending high-rise block completed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco 's concern was aroused by the construction of several high-rise buildings on the bank of the rhine river opposite the cathedral .
since the decision to place the cathedral on the danger list was made , the main culprit - a new high-rise office block built for the rhineland regional council -lrb- lvr -rrb- - has been completed . views from the side of the rhine opposite the cathedral are said to have been compromised by the new building and others , such as the head office of german airline lufthansa , one of the main factors being considered by the whc during its meeting this week . birgitte ringbeck , from the german delegation of observers at last year 's meeting , denied the integrity of the cathedral , built between 1248 and 1880 , was endangered , but recognized that the new construction might have a harmful visual impact , a statement from the delegation said .
top drawer tourist site full of treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the lvr building the cologne cathedral was added to the world heritage list in 1996 and is one of the country 's top tourist draws .
the cathedral contains a wealth of important art works , including the colorful stained-glass windows that flood the cathedral with their mysterious light and the gero cross dated around 970 a.d. , the oldest large sculpture in the western world . the cathedral 's shrine houses the relics of the three kings -lrb- 1180 – 1225 -rrb- , an exceptional example of the regional goldsmiths ’ art , and the altar of the city patrons from the 15th century by stephan lochner , the masterpiece of the cologne school of artists . while the cathedral was long ago replaced as the world 's largest building , which it was at the time of its completion , its western facade remains the biggest of any church in the world , with a surface area of 7,000 square meters -lrb- 23,000 square feet -rrb- flanked by two mighty spires each 157 meters high -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- .
new sites up for consideration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as passing judgment on the cologne cathedral , the whc will consider 28 cultural sites , 10 natural sites and four mixed sites presented by 44 countries , including albania , china and host country south africa as possible additions to unesco 's world heritage list . four countries - bahrain , bosnia-herzegovina , gabon and moldova - could see one of their sites join the list for the first time , a committee statement read . the durban meeting is the first whc session held in the sub-saharan africa since 1972 , when unesco approved a convention concerning the protection of the world 's cultural and natural heritage . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : cologne angered by unesco criticism cologne residents are fiercely proud of their 13th-century gothic cathedral , also a unesco world heritage site .
but the landmark could be stripped of its special status because of the city 's lofty building plans .
-lrb- july 10 , 2004 -rrb- dw-world : cologne cathedral on unesco danger list cologne 's magnificent gothic cathedral has been placed on unesco 's list of world heritage in danger due to the increasing development of the german city 's skyline .

going to a new school is a nerve-wracking time for children and their parents alike .
it 's particularly difficult for the thousands each year who do n't get into the school they wanted .
all this week , breakfast has brought you a new series of films about school choice .
it 's called chasing places .
friday 15 july today is the last in our week long series looking at the struggle many parents have to get their children into the school of their choice .
we 've been inundated with emails and texts from you on this subject and we spoke to the director of the education network group to see what he thinks can be done to make the whole process easier .
watch our interview with martin rogers from the education network during friday 's programme we spoke to jacqui smith , the school 's minister about the difficulties some families are facing - particularly in big towns and cities .
breakfast 's interview with schools ' minister jacqui smith thursday 14 july home schooling for some families the answer can be to opt out of the education system all together and teach their children at home .
anecdotal evidence suggests that home schooling is becoming increasingly popular , though there are no official figures .
this morning on breakfast we feature a family who 've taken the home schooling route .
and we talked to janey lee grace , the radio 2 presenter who teaches her young children at home .
janey says she felt that home schooling was the very best that she could offer her children , particularly because she can allow her children to follow their particular interests and tailor their education to them .
she says she 's not a teacher , but that does n't matter as she feels that as parents you learn with the children and " facilitate their learning " .
janey lee grace we spoke to brenda holliday , trustee of the home education advisory service and john bangs , head of education at the nut - they have opposing views on home schooling .
john bangs said that socialisation could be a problem for children who are educated at home .
but brenda holliday said the reason that many families take their children out of school was " because of the standard of socialisation they have to endure " - in the form of bullying .
and she said that there were many other opportunities for children to socialise .
our debate on home schooling wednesday 13 july faith schools on wednesday we looked at faith schools and the rise in their popularity .
we heard from one breakfast viewer who was unable to get her child into her local jewish school , because of the school 's policy of giving preference to the children of former pupils , over local children .
click here to see one viewer 's struggle to gain a place at a religious school but what 's the answer to over-subscription , particularly in the faith sector ?
on breakfast we spoke to andrew haldenby of the think tank reform .
he believes that parents should be able to open new schools to meet demand more easily .
" one of the most important things we could do is make it much easier for new schools to open so that we have more good school places " andrew haldenby , of think tank reform we also debated the issue of faith schools with frank dobson mp and the church of england 's chief education officer , john hall .
they took opposing views .
frank dobson mp said that with society increasingly divided , education could bring people together : " we need to be looking at an education system which brings people together and makes people experience one another 's cultures and religions " .
john hall claimed that church of england schools , though " distinctively christian " were " inclusive of the local community " .
frank dobson mp and john hall from the church of england debate the merits of religious schools .
we want your views .
tuesday 12 july how far would you go ?
we looked at the lengths parents go to get their child into the right school .
it 's becoming increasingly common for parents to move into the catchment area for their chosen school : in some parts of london , catchment areas have shrunk to a few streets as a result .
this mother told us she would n't blame parents for lying for selective secondary schools , many parents also choose to have their child privately tutored , on top of their regular schooling .
but would you go as far as renting a flat in a catchment area - or even " borrowing " a friend 's address ?
we talked to some parents at the school gates - and we debated the issues with kathryn james of the national association of head teachers and education writer jenni russell. watch tuesday 's chasing places : how far would you go ?
tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- we 'll look at faith-based schools and ask whether it 's fair to exclude children from some of the best-performing schools in the country on the basis of their religion. to have your say , jump straight to our e-mail form monday 11 july no guarantees sarah campbell reported live from a secondary school in derbyshire which is so popular that it ca n't guarantee that even the children in its own catchment area will get in .
john port secondary school in etwall has just over 330 places on offer each year - and more than 600 applicants .
jane hadden caught up with two families whose children have n't got the secondary school they wanted , in other parts of the country .
archie dickins ' life was thrown upside-down when he unexpectedly failed his 11 + exam - and stacey brendon is the only child in her class who has n't got into the secondary school she wanted .
chasing places : archie and stacey 's stories we got some tips on what to do if you 're not happy with your child 's allocated school - from john chard of school appeals.org and dr pat spungin - of raising kids.co.uk. watch our interview with john chard and pat spungin .
how to appeal unfortunately , there is no magic way to get your child into the school of your choice .
but here are a few tips which may help : read the rules the rules on schools admissions are drawn up by your lea -lrb- local education authority -rrb- and so the precise details can differ from one area to another .
what you told breakfast schools are only successful if they are right for your child .
parents take far too much notice of league tables which only tell half the story .
i want my children to be fully rounded people , not academic automatons .
diane , leeds read more viewers ' comments on our your say page but it pays to get a copy of those rules from your lea and read them very carefully .
some individual schools also get the chance to set their own admissions policies : this applies to foundation schools - and to many faith-based schools -lrb- for instance , church of england and roman catholic schools -rrb- construct an argument the most basic mistake you can make , according to john chard , is to lodge an appeal without stating exactly why you think your child should go to the school you 've chosen .
do your homework : research your local admissions policy and the school itself - and construct an argument based on what you 've found .
do n't just say you want the best for your child : that 's what every other parent wants , too .
be realistic do n't set your heart on a school miles from home , simply because it gets the best results in your area .
find out what you have to do to get in there .
it 's very common , for instance , for local education authorities to use distance as the key factor in making decisions , especially at primary level - so do find out whether other people who live in your street have managed to get in .
at secondary level , your child may need to pass a test -lrb- like the 11 + -rrb- or to have gone to a specific " feeder " primary school : in every area , the rules are different .
other criteria used for allocating schools include - " sibling connections " -lrb- so parents do n't find themselves having to do a double drop-off -rrb- and more exceptionally medical or psychological criteria .
do n't forget that some schools are allowed to set their own admissions policies .
this includes " foundation " schools - and many " faith-based " -lrb- religious -rrb- schools - which may ask you to demonstrate that you 're a regular church-goer .
in some areas where competition for church school places is very intense , you may need a report from your vicar or priest on your commitment to the church .
consider going on a waiting list if your school appeal fails , you may find you can still put your child 's name on a waiting list , in case a spare place comes up .
this could mean that your child starts at one school and then transfers to the school you originally wanted , perhaps half-way through a school year .
do n't forget to ask the school or the lea how long it normally takes for the waiting list to clear - and whether people who move into the area will be able to " jump " to the head of the queue if they 're closer to the school than you are .
for popular schools in london , children may be on a waiting list for a matter of months or even years .
you 'll find links on the right hand side of this story to websites which may be able to give you more tips on schools places .
you can use this form to e-mail your story to the breakfast team .
do n't forget to include your name and a daytime contact number , in case we need to ring you back name your e-mail address where you live comments the bbc may edit your comments and not all emails will be published .

going to a new school is a nerve-wracking time for children and their parents alike .
it 's particularly difficult for the thousands each year who do n't get into the school they wanted .
all this week , breakfast has brought you a new series of films about school choice .
it 's called chasing places .
friday 15 july today is the last in our week long series looking at the struggle many parents have to get their children into the school of their choice .
we 've been inundated with emails and texts from you on this subject and we spoke to the director of the education network group to see what he thinks can be done to make the whole process easier .
watch our interview with martin rogers from the education network during friday 's programme we spoke to jacqui smith , the school 's minister about the difficulties some families are facing - particularly in big towns and cities .
breakfast 's interview with schools ' minister jacqui smith thursday 14 july home schooling for some families the answer can be to opt out of the education system all together and teach their children at home .
anecdotal evidence suggests that home schooling is becoming increasingly popular , though there are no official figures .
this morning on breakfast we feature a family who 've taken the home schooling route .
and we talked to janey lee grace , the radio 2 presenter who teaches her young children at home .
janey says she felt that home schooling was the very best that she could offer her children , particularly because she can allow her children to follow their particular interests and tailor their education to them .
she says she 's not a teacher , but that does n't matter as she feels that as parents you learn with the children and " facilitate their learning " .
janey lee grace we spoke to brenda holliday , trustee of the home education advisory service and john bangs , head of education at the nut - they have opposing views on home schooling .
john bangs said that socialisation could be a problem for children who are educated at home .
but brenda holliday said the reason that many families take their children out of school was " because of the standard of socialisation they have to endure " - in the form of bullying .
and she said that there were many other opportunities for children to socialise .
our debate on home schooling wednesday 13 july faith schools on wednesday we looked at faith schools and the rise in their popularity .
we heard from one breakfast viewer who was unable to get her child into her local jewish school , because of the school 's policy of giving preference to the children of former pupils , over local children .
click here to see one viewer 's struggle to gain a place at a religious school but what 's the answer to over-subscription , particularly in the faith sector ?
on breakfast we spoke to andrew haldenby of the think tank reform .
he believes that parents should be able to open new schools to meet demand more easily .
" one of the most important things we could do is make it much easier for new schools to open so that we have more good school places " andrew haldenby , of think tank reform we also debated the issue of faith schools with frank dobson mp and the church of england 's chief education officer , john hall .
they took opposing views .
frank dobson mp said that with society increasingly divided , education could bring people together : " we need to be looking at an education system which brings people together and makes people experience one another 's cultures and religions " .
john hall claimed that church of england schools , though " distinctively christian " were " inclusive of the local community " .
frank dobson mp and john hall from the church of england debate the merits of religious schools .
we want your views .
tuesday 12 july how far would you go ?
we looked at the lengths parents go to get their child into the right school .
it 's becoming increasingly common for parents to move into the catchment area for their chosen school : in some parts of london , catchment areas have shrunk to a few streets as a result .
this mother told us she would n't blame parents for lying for selective secondary schools , many parents also choose to have their child privately tutored , on top of their regular schooling .
but would you go as far as renting a flat in a catchment area - or even " borrowing " a friend 's address ?
we talked to some parents at the school gates - and we debated the issues with kathryn james of the national association of head teachers and education writer jenni russell. watch tuesday 's chasing places : how far would you go ?
tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- we 'll look at faith-based schools and ask whether it 's fair to exclude children from some of the best-performing schools in the country on the basis of their religion. to have your say , jump straight to our e-mail form monday 11 july no guarantees sarah campbell reported live from a secondary school in derbyshire which is so popular that it ca n't guarantee that even the children in its own catchment area will get in .
john port secondary school in etwall has just over 330 places on offer each year - and more than 600 applicants .
jane hadden caught up with two families whose children have n't got the secondary school they wanted , in other parts of the country .
archie dickins ' life was thrown upside-down when he unexpectedly failed his 11 + exam - and stacey brendon is the only child in her class who has n't got into the secondary school she wanted .
chasing places : archie and stacey 's stories we got some tips on what to do if you 're not happy with your child 's allocated school - from john chard of school appeals.org and dr pat spungin - of raising kids.co.uk. watch our interview with john chard and pat spungin .
how to appeal unfortunately , there is no magic way to get your child into the school of your choice .
but here are a few tips which may help : read the rules the rules on schools admissions are drawn up by your lea -lrb- local education authority -rrb- and so the precise details can differ from one area to another .
what you told breakfast schools are only successful if they are right for your child .
parents take far too much notice of league tables which only tell half the story .
i want my children to be fully rounded people , not academic automatons .
diane , leeds read more viewers ' comments on our your say page but it pays to get a copy of those rules from your lea and read them very carefully .
some individual schools also get the chance to set their own admissions policies : this applies to foundation schools - and to many faith-based schools -lrb- for instance , church of england and roman catholic schools -rrb- construct an argument the most basic mistake you can make , according to john chard , is to lodge an appeal without stating exactly why you think your child should go to the school you 've chosen .
do your homework : research your local admissions policy and the school itself - and construct an argument based on what you 've found .
do n't just say you want the best for your child : that 's what every other parent wants , too .
be realistic do n't set your heart on a school miles from home , simply because it gets the best results in your area .
find out what you have to do to get in there .
it 's very common , for instance , for local education authorities to use distance as the key factor in making decisions , especially at primary level - so do find out whether other people who live in your street have managed to get in .
at secondary level , your child may need to pass a test -lrb- like the 11 + -rrb- or to have gone to a specific " feeder " primary school : in every area , the rules are different .
other criteria used for allocating schools include - " sibling connections " -lrb- so parents do n't find themselves having to do a double drop-off -rrb- and more exceptionally medical or psychological criteria .
do n't forget that some schools are allowed to set their own admissions policies .
this includes " foundation " schools - and many " faith-based " -lrb- religious -rrb- schools - which may ask you to demonstrate that you 're a regular church-goer .
in some areas where competition for church school places is very intense , you may need a report from your vicar or priest on your commitment to the church .
consider going on a waiting list if your school appeal fails , you may find you can still put your child 's name on a waiting list , in case a spare place comes up .
this could mean that your child starts at one school and then transfers to the school you originally wanted , perhaps half-way through a school year .
do n't forget to ask the school or the lea how long it normally takes for the waiting list to clear - and whether people who move into the area will be able to " jump " to the head of the queue if they 're closer to the school than you are .

it 's particularly difficult for the thousands each year who do n't get into the school they wanted .
all this week , breakfast has brought you a new series of films about school choice .
it 's called chasing places .
friday 15 july today is the last in our week long series looking at the struggle many parents have to get their children into the school of their choice .
we 've been inundated with emails and texts from you on this subject and we spoke to the director of the education network group to see what he thinks can be done to make the whole process easier .
during friday 's programme we spoke to jacqui smith , the school 's minister about the difficulties some families are facing - particularly in big towns and cities .
thursday 14 july home schooling for some families the answer can be to opt out of the education system all together and teach their children at home .
anecdotal evidence suggests that home schooling is becoming increasingly popular , though there are no official figures .
this morning on breakfast we feature a family who 've taken the home schooling route .
and we talked to janey lee grace , the radio 2 presenter who teaches her young children at home .
janey says she felt that home schooling was the very best that she could offer her children , particularly because she can allow her children to follow their particular interests and tailor their education to them .
she says she 's not a teacher , but that does n't matter as she feels that as parents you learn with the children and " facilitate their learning " .
we spoke to brenda holliday , trustee of the home education advisory service and john bangs , head of education at the nut - they have opposing views on home schooling .
john bangs said that socialisation could be a problem for children who are educated at home .
but brenda holliday said the reason that many families take their children out of school was " because of the standard of socialisation they have to endure " - in the form of bullying .
and she said that there were many other opportunities for children to socialise .
wednesday 13 july faith schools on wednesday we looked at faith schools and the rise in their popularity .
we heard from one breakfast viewer who was unable to get her child into her local jewish school , because of the school 's policy of giving preference to the children of former pupils , over local children .
but what 's the answer to over-subscription , particularly in the faith sector ?
on breakfast we spoke to andrew haldenby of the think tank reform .
he believes that parents should be able to open new schools to meet demand more easily .
" one of the most important things we could do is make it much easier for new schools to open so that we have more good school places " we also debated the issue of faith schools with frank dobson mp and the church of england 's chief education officer , john hall .
they took opposing views .
frank dobson mp said that with society increasingly divided , education could bring people together : " we need to be looking at an education system which brings people together and makes people experience one another 's cultures and religions " .
john hall claimed that church of england schools , though " distinctively christian " were " inclusive of the local community " .
we want your views .
tuesday 12 july how far would you go ?
we looked at the lengths parents go to get their child into the right school .
it 's becoming increasingly common for parents to move into the catchment area for their chosen school : in some parts of london , catchment areas have shrunk to a few streets as a result .
for selective secondary schools , many parents also choose to have their child privately tutored , on top of their regular schooling .
but would you go as far as renting a flat in a catchment area - or even " borrowing " a friend 's address ?
we talked to some parents at the school gates - and we debated the issues with kathryn james of the national association of head teachers and education writer jenni russell .
tomorrow -lrb- wednesday -rrb- we 'll look at faith-based schools and ask whether it 's fair to exclude children from some of the best-performing schools in the country on the basis of their religion .
monday 11 july no guarantees sarah campbell reported live from a secondary school in derbyshire which is so popular that it ca n't guarantee that even the children in its own catchment area will get in .
john port secondary school in etwall has just over 330 places on offer each year - and more than 600 applicants .
jane hadden caught up with two families whose children have n't got the secondary school they wanted , in other parts of the country .
archie dickins ' life was thrown upside-down when he unexpectedly failed his 11 + exam - and stacey brendon is the only child in her class who has n't got into the secondary school she wanted .
we got some tips on what to do if you 're not happy with your child 's allocated school - from john chard of school appeals.org and dr pat spungin - of raising kids.co.uk.
how to appeal unfortunately , there is no magic way to get your child into the school of your choice .
but here are a few tips which may help : read the rules the rules on schools admissions are drawn up by your lea -lrb- local education authority -rrb- and so the precise details can differ from one area to another .
what you told breakfast " schools are only successful if they are right for your child .
parents take far too much notice of league tables which only tell half the story .
i want my children to be fully rounded people , not academic automatons . "
diane , leeds read more viewers ' comments on our your say page but it pays to get a copy of those rules from your lea and read them very carefully .
some individual schools also get the chance to set their own admissions policies : this applies to foundation schools - and to many faith-based schools -lrb- for instance , church of england and roman catholic schools -rrb- construct an argument the most basic mistake you can make , according to john chard , is to lodge an appeal without stating exactly why you think your child should go to the school you 've chosen .
do your homework : research your local admissions policy and the school itself - and construct an argument based on what you 've found .
do n't just say you want the best for your child : that 's what every other parent wants , too .
be realistic do n't set your heart on a school miles from home , simply because it gets the best results in your area .
find out what you have to do to get in there .
it 's very common , for instance , for local education authorities to use distance as the key factor in making decisions , especially at primary level - so do find out whether other people who live in your street have managed to get in .
at secondary level , your child may need to pass a test -lrb- like the 11 + -rrb- or to have gone to a specific " feeder " primary school : in every area , the rules are different .
other criteria used for allocating schools include - " sibling connections " -lrb- so parents do n't find themselves having to do a double drop-off -rrb- and more exceptionally medical or psychological criteria .
do n't forget that some schools are allowed to set their own admissions policies .
this includes " foundation " schools - and many " faith-based " -lrb- religious -rrb- schools - which may ask you to demonstrate that you 're a regular church-goer .
in some areas where competition for church school places is very intense , you may need a report from your vicar or priest on your commitment to the church .
consider going on a waiting list if your school appeal fails , you may find you can still put your child 's name on a waiting list , in case a spare place comes up .
this could mean that your child starts at one school and then transfers to the school you originally wanted , perhaps half-way through a school year .
do n't forget to ask the school or the lea how long it normally takes for the waiting list to clear - and whether people who move into the area will be able to " jump " to the head of the queue if they 're closer to the school than you are .
for popular schools in london , children may be on a waiting list for a matter of months or even years .

but dahl 's hatred of the original 1971 movie almost ended the new project before it began .
dahl wrote the story of charlie bucket 's trip to the fantastic factory of sweet inventor willy wonka in 1964 , inspired by dahl 's brief schoolboy experience as a chocolate taster .
filled with everlasting gobstoppers , snozberries and oompa loompas , the colourful and mischievous tale would go on to sell 13.7 million copies in 32 languages .
chocolate bar by 1971 hollywood also wanted a taste of wonka 's delicious chocolate .
the quaker oats company financed the original $ 3m -lrb- £ 1.7m -rrb- movie to promote its new wonka chocolate bar .
directed by mel stuart , dahl himself wrote the first screenplay but that did not prevent the film being re-named willy wonka and the chocolate factory .
the movie was a modest box office success , finishing 54th in the chart for that year , and quaker 's chocolate bar failed to grab the public imagination .
the 1971 movie was no blockbuster but it became a cult hit on tv nevertheless the film became a huge television hit in the 1980s - as regular a part of christmas schedules as the wizard of oz or chitty chitty bang bang - with its surreal twists adding cult appeal .
its enduring popularity owed much to its star , gene wilder , who made his entrance as willy wonka by pretending to be a frail old man before tumbling into manic action .
" i knew that from then on the audience would n't know if i was lying or telling the truth , " wilder said earlier this year .
nevertheless his playful performance failed to win over dahl , who remained convinced that his first choice - comedian spike milligan - would have been better for the role .
a cast of suitably bratty children , oscar-nominated songs by anthony newley and a disturbing , psychedelic boat ride sequence did not prevent dahl feeling " disappointed " in the movie .
dahl lost faith in hollywood 's ability to do justice to his stories " he thought it placed too much emphasis on willy wonka and not enough on charlie , " said liz attenborough , trustee of the roald dahl museum and story centre in buckinghamshire .
" for him the book was about charlie . "
while that may have irritated the author , the film 's deviations from the original chocolate factory plot infuriated him .
re-worked by the omen writer david seltzer , the movie turned sweetshop rival slugworth into a wonka spy and encouraged charlie and grandpa joe to belch their way to salvation .
his second wife , felicity dahl , understood the author 's frustration .
" they always want to change a book 's storyline , " she said in 1996 .
" what makes hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film , when they accept it in a book ? "
' utterly appalling ' subsequent movie versions of dahl books - such as matilda , the bfg , danny the champion of the world and the witches - brought a similarly hostile response , the author dismissing the latter film as " utterly appalling " .
feeling that another brush with hollywood would bring one creative clash too many , dahl refused to entertain the idea of a second charlie and the chocolate factory film .
after dahl 's death in 1990 , felicity dahl became the protector of his literary legacy .
six years later she began the process of vetting directors , actors and screenplays for a new chocolate factory movie .
jim carrey and adam sandler were among the actors considered for the willy wonka role , while bruce almighty director tom shadyac was suggested as film-maker .
tim burton said that his adaptation would be dark and sinister it was finally decided that tim burton would direct johnny depp in the new $ 150m -lrb- £ 86m -rrb- movie , a partnership that had proved fruitful in 1990 's edward scissorhands and 1999 's sleepy hollow .
burton soon declared this his version would be darker than the 1971 movie .
" i do n't want to crush people 's childhood dreams , but the original film is sappy , " burton said .
" i responded to the children 's book because it respected that children can be adult , and i think adults forget that . "
as he began to create a 192,000-gallon chocolate lake to engulf character augustus gloop , and training 40 squirrels to pounce upon veruca salt , burton said the new film would feature " a sort of foreboding " .
" very sinister things are very much a part of childhood , " he said .
it was a sentiment that even roald dahl would have approved of .

but dahl 's hatred of the original 1971 movie almost ended the new project before it began .
dahl wrote the story of charlie bucket 's trip to the fantastic factory of sweet inventor willy wonka in 1964 , inspired by dahl 's brief schoolboy experience as a chocolate taster .
filled with everlasting gobstoppers , snozberries and oompa loompas , the colourful and mischievous tale would go on to sell 13.7 million copies in 32 languages .
chocolate bar by 1971 hollywood also wanted a taste of wonka 's delicious chocolate .
the quaker oats company financed the original $ 3m -lrb- £ 1.7m -rrb- movie to promote its new wonka chocolate bar .
directed by mel stuart , dahl himself wrote the first screenplay but that did not prevent the film being re-named willy wonka and the chocolate factory .
the movie was a modest box office success , finishing 54th in the chart for that year , and quaker 's chocolate bar failed to grab the public imagination .
the 1971 movie was no blockbuster but it became a cult hit on tv nevertheless the film became a huge television hit in the 1980s - as regular a part of christmas schedules as the wizard of oz or chitty chitty bang bang - with its surreal twists adding cult appeal .
its enduring popularity owed much to its star , gene wilder , who made his entrance as willy wonka by pretending to be a frail old man before tumbling into manic action .
" i knew that from then on the audience would n't know if i was lying or telling the truth , " wilder said earlier this year .
nevertheless his playful performance failed to win over dahl , who remained convinced that his first choice - comedian spike milligan - would have been better for the role .
a cast of suitably bratty children , oscar-nominated songs by anthony newley and a disturbing , psychedelic boat ride sequence did not prevent dahl feeling " disappointed " in the movie .
dahl lost faith in hollywood 's ability to do justice to his stories " he thought it placed too much emphasis on willy wonka and not enough on charlie , " said liz attenborough , trustee of the roald dahl museum and story centre in buckinghamshire .
" for him the book was about charlie . "
while that may have irritated the author , the film 's deviations from the original chocolate factory plot infuriated him .
re-worked by the omen writer david seltzer , the movie turned sweetshop rival slugworth into a wonka spy and encouraged charlie and grandpa joe to belch their way to salvation .
his second wife , felicity dahl , understood the author 's frustration .
" they always want to change a book 's storyline , " she said in 1996 .
" what makes hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film , when they accept it in a book ? "
' utterly appalling ' subsequent movie versions of dahl books - such as matilda , the bfg , danny the champion of the world and the witches - brought a similarly hostile response , the author dismissing the latter film as " utterly appalling " .
feeling that another brush with hollywood would bring one creative clash too many , dahl refused to entertain the idea of a second charlie and the chocolate factory film .
after dahl 's death in 1990 , felicity dahl became the protector of his literary legacy .
six years later she began the process of vetting directors , actors and screenplays for a new chocolate factory movie .
jim carrey and adam sandler were among the actors considered for the willy wonka role , while bruce almighty director tom shadyac was suggested as film-maker .

britney spears , who is expecting her first child in the autumn , was also at the event at grauman 's chinese theatre .
depp said his inspiration for the wonka character was " part game show host , part children 's show host ... locked in a closet for about 10 or 15 years " .
but he has denied rumours that he based his performance on michael jackson .
" it never entered my mind , " he told sydney 's herald sun newspaper , saying the character was more similar to reclusive billionaire howard hughes .
depp 's partner vanessa paradis , actress melanie griffith and malcolm in the middle star frankie muniz were among the other guests .
darker tim burton 's film , based on the hugely popular book by late author roald dahl , also stars the director 's fiancée helena bonham carter and depp 's finding neverland co-star , freddie highmore .
the 13-year-old british actor plays impoverished charlie bucket , who wins a golden ticket to visit the chocolate factory with his grandpa .
burton also directed depp in edward scissorhands and sleepy hollow " i think johnny brings a great edge to willy wonka , " he said .
" he invites kids to the factory and gives them sweets and chocolates , but on the other hand the four of them meet a sticky end . "
burton has said his is a much darker version of the story than that portrayed in the original film , which starred gene wilder as willy wonka .
however , he has also poured scorn on the mooted jackson connection .
" i always laugh about that because to me there is like a night and day difference , " he told reporters in australia recently .
" michael jackson likes children and willy wonka ca n't stand children .
" to me there is absolutely no connection as far as my mind goes . "
charlie and the chocolate factory is out in the us on friday and the uk on 29 july .

this was the most significant series of steps ever taken to try to break the network that has been protecting europe 's most wanted man for the past eight years .
karadzic enjoys support among many bosnian serbs the chief international envoy to bosnia , lord ashdown , said his aim was " to get rid of the cancer of obstructionism and corruption in the bosnian serb republic -lrb- that has been protecting radovan karadzic -rrb- and nothing less than major surgery will do " .
paddy ashdown outlined 10 measures , including the removal of 60 bosnian serb officials , who he said had been helping suspected war criminals in one way or another , including radovan karadzic .
the former bosnian serb leader - charged with genocide by the un war crimes tribunal - has been on the run for the past eight years .
mr karadzic is now believed to be in a remote , mountainous part of north-west montenegro , near the town of niksic where he grew up , sources close to the investigation told the bbc .
that would put him beyond the reach of international forces in bosnia .
nato 's attempts to arrest him have always ended in embarrassing failure .
conspiracy theories but the question is , why has it taken so long for the international community to act so decisively ?
all i 'm clear about , is that this man -lsb- radovan karadzic -rsb- will end up in the hague .
if it happened tomorrow it would be too late for me lord ashdown chief international envoy to bosnia timeline : hunting karadzic conspiracy theories abound in this balkan country , where rumour and speculation are the common currency in the corner coffee shop .
some bosnian muslims believe mr karadzic will never be caught , that a deal was done with the west in 1996 promising him his freedom if he withdrew from public life .
the idea received support from mr karadzic 's wife , ljiljana , who said the west was reneging on an agreement by genuinely trying to arrest him .
others believe mr karadzic will never be tried because he holds too many secrets , and could make embarrassing revelations about the role of western governments during the bosnian war .
this school of thought says mr karadzic could be killed during the operation to arrest him .
and yet others believe elements within the nato force itself , particularly the french , are sympathetic to the bosnian serb cause .
' no deadlines ' whilst individual french officers have in the past been found to have such sympathies , no hard evidence has ever emerged that any have deliberately protected mr karadzic .
western diplomats believe mr karadzic has eluded capture for two basic reasons - the difficulty in carrying out an arrest operation in the remote , mountainous region where he is believed to hide out ; and the powerful network of politicians and security figures who have been his shield .
and it is that shield that mr ashdown is trying to shatter with the series of measures announced on wednesday .
but when asked after his dramatic press conference when he thought mr karadzic would finally be arrested , mr ashdown could only say : " i 'm not going to give deadlines . "
" all i 'm clear about , is that this man will end up in the hague .
if it happened tomorrow it would be too late for me . "

the conquest is based on bmw 850 or 1150 motorbikes which have been integrated into a racing car-type aluminium body shell .
its creator , alan martin , came up with the idea after his son became disabled following an accident .
the company will be launching the conquest in august and hopes to sell 100 in the first year of production .
the bike was on show at the mobility roadshow , an exhibition of products for people with mobility impairments , at donnington park in derbyshire over the weekend .
" my son 's now walking again so he does n't need it , " mr martin told the bbc news website .
" but i 've built this beautiful machine which i feel will enhance the lives of so many disabled people . "
' steady as a rock ' the conquest is designed to be driven from the rider 's wheelchair and should be suitable for people without the use of their legs but with good upper body mobility .
it has been developed with assistance from the national association for bikers with a disability -lrb- nabd -rrb- and the manchester business school among others . "
this is a totally new concept , a trike that is safe and which gives you independence and the freedom of the road " carl brunning , conquest owner young theme for roadshow although it was in the planning for four years , mr martin could always see the finished product in his mind 's eye .
" i have to admit i 'm so proud of it because it 's come out just as i visualised it . "
the ' trike ' will cost £ 18,500 - about the same as a new family car - and mr martin hopes it will appeal to former bikers who are no longer able to climb into the saddle , as well as aspiring disabled riders .
the 1150cc version will accelerate from 0-60mph in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 85mph .

the conquest is based on bmw 850 or 1150 motorbikes which have been integrated into a racing car-type aluminium body shell .
its creator , alan martin , came up with the idea after his son became disabled following an accident .
the company will be launching the conquest in august and hopes to sell 100 in the first year of production .
the bike was on show at the mobility roadshow , an exhibition of products for people with mobility impairments , at donnington park in derbyshire over the weekend .
" my son 's now walking again so he does n't need it , " mr martin told the bbc news website .
" but i 've built this beautiful machine which i feel will enhance the lives of so many disabled people . "
' steady as a rock ' the conquest is designed to be driven from the rider 's wheelchair and should be suitable for people without the use of their legs but with good upper body mobility .
it has been developed with assistance from the national association for bikers with a disability -lrb- nabd -rrb- and the manchester business school among others .
this is a totally new concept , a trike that is safe and which gives you independence and the freedom of the road carl brunning , conquest owner young theme for roadshow although it was in the planning for four years , mr martin could always see the finished product in his mind 's eye .
" i have to admit i 'm so proud of it because it 's come out just as i visualised it . "
the ' trike ' will cost £ 18,500 - about the same as a new family car - and mr martin hopes it will appeal to former bikers who are no longer able to climb into the saddle , as well as aspiring disabled riders .
the 1150cc version will accelerate from 0-60mph in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 85mph .
but mr martin says the one he drove on a test track topped 100mph and was " as steady as a rock " .
freedom of the road the first person to buy a conquest is former climber , carl brunning from east yorkshire .
before his climbing accident , mr brunning was a keen motorcyclist and he says he can not wait to start riding his new machine .
" this is a totally new concept , a trike that is safe and which gives you independence and the freedom of the road , " he said .
mr brunning 's only other experience of motorcycling after his accident was as a side-car passenger .
he says with the conquest he feels like an integral part of the machine .
the manufacturers , martin conquest ltd , have begun negotiations with motability , the organisation that provides lease vehicles for disabled people .
if the conquest is accepted , it could be become available to thousands of disabled people who are eligible for assistance from the scheme .

by evan davis bbc economics editor a thumbs-up from tony blair , but for many the jury remains out it may have been the most unpredictable week many of us can remember .
but looking back at the gleneagles summit and its measures to make poverty history , we can at least say the g8 leaders were reassuringly unsurprising .
no-one can claim the g8 summit , which concluded on friday , saved the world .
no-one can claim the g8 failed to act .
the deal that was struck on africa was the very one we could have expected the week before .
to summarise , the deal got nowhere on the issue of trade -lrb- and was never really likely to -rrb- , but it made progress on debt relief and aid .
big cheque the g8 love to make their modest steps sound like giant leaps .
they are adept at getting big headlines for little money .
more g8 money has been directed at africa 's poorest the debt relief package cost so little - maybe $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 860m -rrb- a year across all the g8 countries - we would normally barely feel that that kind of money was worth reporting .
a second debt package , specifically aimed at nigeria , brilliantly involves nigeria buying itself out of its debt , and thus writing a big cheque to western governments rather than us writing a cheque to them .
however , looking at the overall resources directed towards africa by the west in the form of both aid and debt relief , the africa commission asked for an extra $ 25bn a year in 2010 compared to 2004 , and that is what the g8 appears to have delivered .
so is $ 25bn a significant sum or not ?
is it enough ?
here is my guide to whether the 2005 g8 summit was worth the trouble .
more for africa it is n't entirely appropriate to measure western efforts for africa and the world in terms of the percentage of national income handed over in the form of aid .
but it is probably the single best statistical way of capturing the effort if you want to put it in numerical terms .
and in those terms , progress was made .
the g8 leaders made little progress on trade issues before the round of meetings and pledges associated with the g8 in 2005 , you could add up donor aid promises and get an overall aid level -lrb- to the whole world -rrb- of about 0.3 % of national income in 2006 .
what this ' year of africa ' has done is raise new promises that add up to about 0.36 % of national income for 2010 .
one might therefore summarise the effect of all this year 's work as being an uplift of 0.06 % of national income going to poorer countries .
that 's the approximate difference between previous promises and the new ones .
as the basic rule of thumb is that half the increase in aid can be expected to go to africa , essentially we have pledged an extra 0.03 % of national income to africa as a result of this year 's extraordinary efforts .
that is the extra aid over and above what might have been achieved in the absence of this year 's efforts .
promises , promises to put that in context , for someone on a typical british wage of £ 25,000 a year , 0.03 % is £ 7.50 a year .
that does n't sound a lot , but it also takes us back to the kinds of aid levels -lrb- measured in percentage of national income terms -rrb- that we had in the 1980s .
it does , of course , leave us far short of the 0.5 % that was given in 1960 ; it is far short of the 0.46 % sought by the sachs commission for the un ; and it is only half the 0.7 % level promised in 1970 .
and it has to be said that even what was achieved is still only a promise .
we have not yet achieved the previous promises of reaching 0.3 % .
and we are making new , bigger promises .
the money is not in the bank .
so looking back at it all , if you were someone who marched in edinburgh , or who went to live 8 with a strong sense of hope , should you now be giving much credit to our leaders for that achievement ?
or should you feel slightly duped by a process that seems to have come up with the same old answers ?
my judgement is that you can be content .
a modest step forward is still a good deal better than the few steps back that have characterised recent years .

one might therefore summarise the effect of all this year 's work as being an uplift of 0.06 % of national income going to poorer countries .
that 's the approximate difference between previous promises and the new ones .
as the basic rule of thumb is that half the increase in aid can be expected to go to africa , essentially we have pledged an extra 0.03 % of national income to africa as a result of this year 's extraordinary efforts .
that is the extra aid over and above what might have been achieved in the absence of this year 's efforts .
promises , promises to put that in context , for someone on a typical british wage of £ 25,000 a year , 0.03 % is £ 7.50 a year .
that does n't sound a lot , but it also takes us back to the kinds of aid levels -lrb- measured in percentage of national income terms -rrb- that we had in the 1980s .
it does , of course , leave us far short of the 0.5 % that was given in 1960 ; it is far short of the 0.46 % sought by the sachs commission for the un ; and it is only half the 0.7 % level promised in 1970 .
and it has to be said that even what was achieved is still only a promise .
we have not yet achieved the previous promises of reaching 0.3 % .
and we are making new , bigger promises .
the money is not in the bank .
so looking back at it all , if you were someone who marched in edinburgh , or who went to live 8 with a strong sense of hope , should you now be giving much credit to our leaders for that achievement ?
or should you feel slightly duped by a process that seems to have come up with the same old answers ?
my judgement is that you can be content .
a modest step forward is still a good deal better than the few steps back that have characterised recent years .

by evan davis bbc economics editor a thumbs-up from tony blair , but for many the jury remains out it may have been the most unpredictable week many of us can remember .
but looking back at the gleneagles summit and its measures to make poverty history , we can at least say the g8 leaders were reassuringly unsurprising .
no-one can claim the g8 summit , which concluded on friday , saved the world .
no-one can claim the g8 failed to act .
the deal that was struck on africa was the very one we could have expected the week before .
to summarise , the deal got nowhere on the issue of trade -lrb- and was never really likely to -rrb- , but it made progress on debt relief and aid .
big cheque the g8 love to make their modest steps sound like giant leaps .
they are adept at getting big headlines for little money .
more g8 money has been directed at africa 's poorest the debt relief package cost so little - maybe $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 860m -rrb- a year across all the g8 countries - we would normally barely feel that that kind of money was worth reporting .
a second debt package , specifically aimed at nigeria , brilliantly involves nigeria buying itself out of its debt , and thus writing a big cheque to western governments rather than us writing a cheque to them .
however , looking at the overall resources directed towards africa by the west in the form of both aid and debt relief , the africa commission asked for an extra $ 25bn a year in 2010 compared to 2004 , and that is what the g8 appears to have delivered .
so is $ 25bn a significant sum or not ?
is it enough ?
here is my guide to whether the 2005 g8 summit was worth the trouble .
more for africa it is n't entirely appropriate to measure western efforts for africa and the world in terms of the percentage of national income handed over in the form of aid .
but it is probably the single best statistical way of capturing the effort if you want to put it in numerical terms .
and in those terms , progress was made .

a windows virus has been created that claims to link to amateur video footage of the aftermath of one of the bombs on the london underground .
anyone following the link in the e-mail will have their computer infected by a program that puts it under the remote control of the virus creator .
the virus tries to look more legitimate by posing as a newsletter from us news organisation cnn .
video grab the virus is travelling in an e-mail which bears the subject line : " terror hits london " and comes from a spoofed e-mail address .
the body of the message tells those receiving it to click on the attached file which claims to show amateur video footage shot in the london underground immediately after one of the bombs went off .
a file called " london terror moovie.avi " is attached to the malicious e-mail .
hidden after a long series of blank spaces is the real title of the file that is attached .
an attempt has been made to make this look harmless by giving it the name : " checked by norton antivirus.exe " .
anyone clicking on the file will not be shown a video .
instead their pc will be infected by the as yet un-named trojan .
next time the compromised machine is started , it will report in to the virus creator and become part of a spam-sending zombie network .
because it relies on people clicking on the attachment , the malicious program can affect windows 2000 , 95 , 98 , me , nt , xp and windows server 2003 .
although the program is not widely distributed , security companies asked people to be vigilant and update their anti-virus software regularly .
