the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .
i 'm prepared to give up my german identity card , if only i can leave here .
it was a mistake to come here .
you should just stay where you were born .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .

there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .
" we have various players in different circumstances , but i 'm satisfied we have a good group . " france uninspiring but still unbeaten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : les bleus have n't astonished fans despite fielding top players despite being ranked fifth in the world and given relatively good 12-1 odds of winning the tournament , france still ca n't be sure if they will end their germany 2006 campaign raising the cup , as they did at home in 1998 , or returning to disappointed fans after the first rounds without a goal to their name , as happened in the 2002 south korea / japan finals . france features more than enough talent to advance in the contest with the likes of star playmaker zinedine zidane in the midfield and thierry henry and david trezeguet , two of the world 's top strikers , attacking the opponent 's goal , but les bleus often have difficulties converting individual skills into team goals . though raymond domenech 's french side have n't lost in the last 17 games , their workman-like performance of late has been anything but inspiring , and there are plenty of other teams , including perennially strong england , spain and italy , looking to knock down france and the rest of the 2006 favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no clear favorites , according to pele for now , picking the world cup winner remains a guessing game , and even as soccer stars from around the globe throw their support behind various teams , brazilian legend pele -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded the world " it is not always the favorites with the best players that win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.11.2005 for many german-russians , there 's no place like home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , the motherland is still the only place they feel they belong for decades , germany has opened its doors to ethnic germans from the former soviet union .
but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .
i 'm prepared to give up my german identity card , if only i can leave here .
it was a mistake to come here .
you should just stay where you were born .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .
" we have various players in different circumstances , but i 'm satisfied we have a good group . " france uninspiring but still unbeaten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : les bleus have n't astonished fans despite fielding top players despite being ranked fifth in the world and given relatively good 12-1 odds of winning the tournament , france still ca n't be sure if they will end their germany 2006 campaign raising the cup , as they did at home in 1998 , or returning to disappointed fans after the first rounds without a goal to their name , as happened in the 2002 south korea / japan finals . france features more than enough talent to advance in the contest with the likes of star playmaker zinedine zidane in the midfield and thierry henry and david trezeguet , two of the world 's top strikers , attacking the opponent 's goal , but les bleus often have difficulties converting individual skills into team goals . though raymond domenech 's french side have n't lost in the last 17 games , their workman-like performance of late has been anything but inspiring , and there are plenty of other teams , including perennially strong england , spain and italy , looking to knock down france and the rest of the 2006 favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no clear favorites , according to pele for now , picking the world cup winner remains a guessing game , and even as soccer stars from around the globe throw their support behind various teams , brazilian legend pele -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded the world " it is not always the favorites with the best players that win .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .

" we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .

the defending champions scored a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld in extra time , while second place werder bremen tore apart wolfsburg . schalke 04 slipped behind in the title race with a 2-2 draw in cologne , and hertha bsc berlin also were n't able to claim any points in a 0-2 loss to borussia dortmund . at the german top flight 's bottom end , nuremburg won their second match of the season , with a 3-1 victory over kaiserslautern , leaving the " red devils " to prop up all the other 17 bundesliga teams . ballack missing from bayern side peruvian international claudio pizarro saved bayern munich 's blushes by scoring twice in the final eight minutes to make sure bayern maintained their five-point cushion at the bundesliga summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack did his yelling from the bench on saturday sorely missing german national team captain , michael ballack -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose contract saga dominated the headlines throughout the week but was sidelined with a thigh injury , reigning champions bayern looked set to be heading for only their second defeat of the season . bielefeld 's ghanaian international isaac boakye rolled the ball past bayern keeper oliver kahn from close range on the hour mark , but pizarro leveled in the 82nd minute and then scored the winner with the last kick of the match after a mistake in the bielefeld defense . " bielefeld were better than us , " bayern coach felix magath admitted .
" they ruled the game and i really did n't believe we could turn it around after their opening goal . " schalke fall behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen remain in second after beathing wolfsburg it was a vital win for bayern with werder bremen crushing vfl wolfsburg 6-1 at home to stay five points behind the pacesetters .
werder striker and german international miroslav klose scored twice in the second half to take his season 's tally to 14 and extend his lead at the top of the goal scoring charts . " this kind of victory gives our self-confidence a boost , " said bremen trainer thomas schaaf , whose team will be looking for any edge it can get before their european match wednesday against barcelona .
" the team shot some very pretty goals . " with bremen and bayern both winning , last season 's runners-up schalke 04 needed to keep pace but could only manage a 2-2 draw at fc cologne and fall 12 points behind bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's early goal was n't enough to keep schalke ahead of cologne despite a strong start and first half goal from kevin kuranyi , schalke fell behind in the second 45 minutes until ebbe sand poked in the equalizer in the 86th minute . " we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .
if third-placed sv hamburg win at msv duisburg on sunday they will have a six-point cushion over fourth-placed schalke . hertha lose in dortmund … again the westfalen stadium in dortmund remained an unconquerable fortress for hertha berlin .
ebi smolarek scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season in dortmund 's well-deserved win .
hertha 's last victory in dortmund was in 1972 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund tallied another win at home against berlin borussia mönchengladbach will have to continue waiting for their first home win against bayer leverkusen since 1989 after saturday 's 1-1 draw .
leverkusen took the lead in the fifth minute on a simon rolfes goal , but borussia 's eugen polanski was able to level the score nine minutes later . the first bundesliga derby in bruchweg stadium saw mainz 05 and eintracht frankfurt split the spoils in a 2-2 draw . implausibly , three of the four goals came from mainz 's nikolce noveski , who scored two own goals within three minutes of each other then partially made up for the collapse with a goal in the right direction 20 minutes before the final whistle .
petr ruman tied the score for mainz in the match 's final minute . " everything got started in the completely wrong direction , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .
" we have various players in different circumstances , but i 'm satisfied we have a good group . " france uninspiring but still unbeaten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : les bleus have n't astonished fans despite fielding top players despite being ranked fifth in the world and given relatively good 12-1 odds of winning the tournament , france still ca n't be sure if they will end their germany 2006 campaign raising the cup , as they did at home in 1998 , or returning to disappointed fans after the first rounds without a goal to their name , as happened in the 2002 south korea / japan finals . france features more than enough talent to advance in the contest with the likes of star playmaker zinedine zidane in the midfield and thierry henry and david trezeguet , two of the world 's top strikers , attacking the opponent 's goal , but les bleus often have difficulties converting individual skills into team goals . though raymond domenech 's french side have n't lost in the last 17 games , their workman-like performance of late has been anything but inspiring , and there are plenty of other teams , including perennially strong england , spain and italy , looking to knock down france and the rest of the 2006 favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no clear favorites , according to pele for now , picking the world cup winner remains a guessing game , and even as soccer stars from around the globe throw their support behind various teams , brazilian legend pele -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded the world " it is not always the favorites with the best players that win .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most .

robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .
" we have various players in different circumstances , but i 'm satisfied we have a good group . " france uninspiring but still unbeaten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : les bleus have n't astonished fans despite fielding top players despite being ranked fifth in the world and given relatively good 12-1 odds of winning the tournament , france still ca n't be sure if they will end their germany 2006 campaign raising the cup , as they did at home in 1998 , or returning to disappointed fans after the first rounds without a goal to their name , as happened in the 2002 south korea / japan finals . france features more than enough talent to advance in the contest with the likes of star playmaker zinedine zidane in the midfield and thierry henry and david trezeguet , two of the world 's top strikers , attacking the opponent 's goal , but les bleus often have difficulties converting individual skills into team goals . though raymond domenech 's french side have n't lost in the last 17 games , their workman-like performance of late has been anything but inspiring , and there are plenty of other teams , including perennially strong england , spain and italy , looking to knock down france and the rest of the 2006 favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no clear favorites , according to pele for now , picking the world cup winner remains a guessing game , and even as soccer stars from around the globe throw their support behind various teams , brazilian legend pele -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded the world " it is not always the favorites with the best players that win .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .
i 'm prepared to give up my german identity card , if only i can leave here .
it was a mistake to come here .
you should just stay where you were born .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .

all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .

there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .

the defending champions scored a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld in extra time , while second place werder bremen tore apart wolfsburg . schalke 04 slipped behind in the title race with a 2-2 draw in cologne , and hertha bsc berlin also were n't able to claim any points in a 0-2 loss to borussia dortmund . at the german top flight 's bottom end , nuremburg won their second match of the season , with a 3-1 victory over kaiserslautern , leaving the " red devils " to prop up all the other 17 bundesliga teams . ballack missing from bayern side peruvian international claudio pizarro saved bayern munich 's blushes by scoring twice in the final eight minutes to make sure bayern maintained their five-point cushion at the bundesliga summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack did his yelling from the bench on saturday sorely missing german national team captain , michael ballack -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose contract saga dominated the headlines throughout the week but was sidelined with a thigh injury , reigning champions bayern looked set to be heading for only their second defeat of the season . bielefeld 's ghanaian international isaac boakye rolled the ball past bayern keeper oliver kahn from close range on the hour mark , but pizarro leveled in the 82nd minute and then scored the winner with the last kick of the match after a mistake in the bielefeld defense . " bielefeld were better than us , " bayern coach felix magath admitted .
" they ruled the game and i really did n't believe we could turn it around after their opening goal . " schalke fall behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen remain in second after beathing wolfsburg it was a vital win for bayern with werder bremen crushing vfl wolfsburg 6-1 at home to stay five points behind the pacesetters .
werder striker and german international miroslav klose scored twice in the second half to take his season 's tally to 14 and extend his lead at the top of the goal scoring charts . " this kind of victory gives our self-confidence a boost , " said bremen trainer thomas schaaf , whose team will be looking for any edge it can get before their european match wednesday against barcelona .
" the team shot some very pretty goals . " with bremen and bayern both winning , last season 's runners-up schalke 04 needed to keep pace but could only manage a 2-2 draw at fc cologne and fall 12 points behind bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's early goal was n't enough to keep schalke ahead of cologne despite a strong start and first half goal from kevin kuranyi , schalke fell behind in the second 45 minutes until ebbe sand poked in the equalizer in the 86th minute . " we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .
if third-placed sv hamburg win at msv duisburg on sunday they will have a six-point cushion over fourth-placed schalke . hertha lose in dortmund … again the westfalen stadium in dortmund remained an unconquerable fortress for hertha berlin .
ebi smolarek scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season in dortmund 's well-deserved win .
hertha 's last victory in dortmund was in 1972 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund tallied another win at home against berlin borussia mönchengladbach will have to continue waiting for their first home win against bayer leverkusen since 1989 after saturday 's 1-1 draw .
leverkusen took the lead in the fifth minute on a simon rolfes goal , but borussia 's eugen polanski was able to level the score nine minutes later . the first bundesliga derby in bruchweg stadium saw mainz 05 and eintracht frankfurt split the spoils in a 2-2 draw . implausibly , three of the four goals came from mainz 's nikolce noveski , who scored two own goals within three minutes of each other then partially made up for the collapse with a goal in the right direction 20 minutes before the final whistle .
petr ruman tied the score for mainz in the match 's final minute . " everything got started in the completely wrong direction , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp .

the defending champions scored a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld in extra time , while second place werder bremen tore apart wolfsburg . schalke 04 slipped behind in the title race with a 2-2 draw in cologne , and hertha bsc berlin also were n't able to claim any points in a 0-2 loss to borussia dortmund . at the german top flight 's bottom end , nuremburg won their second match of the season , with a 3-1 victory over kaiserslautern , leaving the " red devils " to prop up all the other 17 bundesliga teams . ballack missing from bayern side peruvian international claudio pizarro saved bayern munich 's blushes by scoring twice in the final eight minutes to make sure bayern maintained their five-point cushion at the bundesliga summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack did his yelling from the bench on saturday sorely missing german national team captain , michael ballack -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose contract saga dominated the headlines throughout the week but was sidelined with a thigh injury , reigning champions bayern looked set to be heading for only their second defeat of the season . bielefeld 's ghanaian international isaac boakye rolled the ball past bayern keeper oliver kahn from close range on the hour mark , but pizarro leveled in the 82nd minute and then scored the winner with the last kick of the match after a mistake in the bielefeld defense . " bielefeld were better than us , " bayern coach felix magath admitted .
" they ruled the game and i really did n't believe we could turn it around after their opening goal . " schalke fall behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen remain in second after beathing wolfsburg it was a vital win for bayern with werder bremen crushing vfl wolfsburg 6-1 at home to stay five points behind the pacesetters .
werder striker and german international miroslav klose scored twice in the second half to take his season 's tally to 14 and extend his lead at the top of the goal scoring charts . " this kind of victory gives our self-confidence a boost , " said bremen trainer thomas schaaf , whose team will be looking for any edge it can get before their european match wednesday against barcelona .
" the team shot some very pretty goals . " with bremen and bayern both winning , last season 's runners-up schalke 04 needed to keep pace but could only manage a 2-2 draw at fc cologne and fall 12 points behind bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's early goal was n't enough to keep schalke ahead of cologne despite a strong start and first half goal from kevin kuranyi , schalke fell behind in the second 45 minutes until ebbe sand poked in the equalizer in the 86th minute . " we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .
if third-placed sv hamburg win at msv duisburg on sunday they will have a six-point cushion over fourth-placed schalke . hertha lose in dortmund … again the westfalen stadium in dortmund remained an unconquerable fortress for hertha berlin .
ebi smolarek scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season in dortmund 's well-deserved win .
hertha 's last victory in dortmund was in 1972 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund tallied another win at home against berlin borussia mönchengladbach will have to continue waiting for their first home win against bayer leverkusen since 1989 after saturday 's 1-1 draw .
leverkusen took the lead in the fifth minute on a simon rolfes goal , but borussia 's eugen polanski was able to level the score nine minutes later . the first bundesliga derby in bruchweg stadium saw mainz 05 and eintracht frankfurt split the spoils in a 2-2 draw . implausibly , three of the four goals came from mainz 's nikolce noveski , who scored two own goals within three minutes of each other then partially made up for the collapse with a goal in the right direction 20 minutes before the final whistle .
petr ruman tied the score for mainz in the match 's final minute . " everything got started in the completely wrong direction , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp .
" it was n't until the second half that we were able to right ourselves . " fourth manager shown to the door bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henke , left , wo n't be around to console kaiserslautern players any longer kaiserslautern wasted little time in sacking coach michael henke after falling to the league basement .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .
" we have various players in different circumstances , but i 'm satisfied we have a good group . " france uninspiring but still unbeaten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : les bleus have n't astonished fans despite fielding top players despite being ranked fifth in the world and given relatively good 12-1 odds of winning the tournament , france still ca n't be sure if they will end their germany 2006 campaign raising the cup , as they did at home in 1998 , or returning to disappointed fans after the first rounds without a goal to their name , as happened in the 2002 south korea / japan finals . france features more than enough talent to advance in the contest with the likes of star playmaker zinedine zidane in the midfield and thierry henry and david trezeguet , two of the world 's top strikers , attacking the opponent 's goal , but les bleus often have difficulties converting individual skills into team goals . though raymond domenech 's french side have n't lost in the last 17 games , their workman-like performance of late has been anything but inspiring , and there are plenty of other teams , including perennially strong england , spain and italy , looking to knock down france and the rest of the 2006 favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no clear favorites , according to pele for now , picking the world cup winner remains a guessing game , and even as soccer stars from around the globe throw their support behind various teams , brazilian legend pele -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded the world " it is not always the favorites with the best players that win .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off is the bundesliga too weak ? ballack header saves bayern record bremen stick with record breaking bayern sports -pipe- 19.11.2005 bayern stay ahead with last minute goal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after thrashing wolfsburg , bremen could n't gain any ground on bayern a good dose of luck helped munich keep their lead atop the bundesliga saturday .
the defending champions scored a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld in extra time , while second place werder bremen tore apart wolfsburg . schalke 04 slipped behind in the title race with a 2-2 draw in cologne , and hertha bsc berlin also were n't able to claim any points in a 0-2 loss to borussia dortmund . at the german top flight 's bottom end , nuremburg won their second match of the season , with a 3-1 victory over kaiserslautern , leaving the " red devils " to prop up all the other 17 bundesliga teams . ballack missing from bayern side peruvian international claudio pizarro saved bayern munich 's blushes by scoring twice in the final eight minutes to make sure bayern maintained their five-point cushion at the bundesliga summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack did his yelling from the bench on saturday sorely missing german national team captain , michael ballack -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose contract saga dominated the headlines throughout the week but was sidelined with a thigh injury , reigning champions bayern looked set to be heading for only their second defeat of the season . bielefeld 's ghanaian international isaac boakye rolled the ball past bayern keeper oliver kahn from close range on the hour mark , but pizarro leveled in the 82nd minute and then scored the winner with the last kick of the match after a mistake in the bielefeld defense . " bielefeld were better than us , " bayern coach felix magath admitted .
" they ruled the game and i really did n't believe we could turn it around after their opening goal . " schalke fall behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen remain in second after beathing wolfsburg it was a vital win for bayern with werder bremen crushing vfl wolfsburg 6-1 at home to stay five points behind the pacesetters .
werder striker and german international miroslav klose scored twice in the second half to take his season 's tally to 14 and extend his lead at the top of the goal scoring charts . " this kind of victory gives our self-confidence a boost , " said bremen trainer thomas schaaf , whose team will be looking for any edge it can get before their european match wednesday against barcelona .
" the team shot some very pretty goals . " with bremen and bayern both winning , last season 's runners-up schalke 04 needed to keep pace but could only manage a 2-2 draw at fc cologne and fall 12 points behind bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's early goal was n't enough to keep schalke ahead of cologne despite a strong start and first half goal from kevin kuranyi , schalke fell behind in the second 45 minutes until ebbe sand poked in the equalizer in the 86th minute . " we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .
if third-placed sv hamburg win at msv duisburg on sunday they will have a six-point cushion over fourth-placed schalke . hertha lose in dortmund … again the westfalen stadium in dortmund remained an unconquerable fortress for hertha berlin .
ebi smolarek scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season in dortmund 's well-deserved win .

defending champions brazil top the rankings , as usual , but a number of teams are close on their heels . while qualifying for the world cup is already a success for finals debutant trinidad and tobago and the australian socceroos , who will make their second tournament appearance in germany , devoted soccer fans in rio , amsterdam , prague , buenos aires and paris will be expecting much more from their national teams . brazil still tops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have raised the cup more often than any other nation five-time champions and two-time runners up , brazil , on paper , is still the team the world wants to beat .
the last time the brazilians had such an easy time of qualifying was for the 1990 italian finals .
after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team . " there 's no denying it - brazil are favorites to win the cup , " he said .
" playing in the qualifiers -lrb- the first time the fifa world cup holders have had to do this -rrb- forced the team to train hard , and we have players of great technical ability . " netherlands want to reverse second place trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van nistelrooy 's dutch team made it to the euro 2004 semi-finals the netherlands have time and again proved their players have the technical skill to compete among the best , and failing to reach the 2002 finals was a blow to the oranje , and one marco van basten 's current squad was happy to get over with a trip to germany 2006 . though the two-time world cup runners up have repeatedly proven they are deep in talent and experience , holland have frequently failed to live up to the world 's expectation in the past . currently ranked second in the world , the netherlands won their european qualifying group to book their ticket to germany with 10 wins and two draws .
robin van persie and ruud van nistelrooy could represent holland 's best chance at winning their country 's first world championship . czechs have big plans for first finals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavel nedved , right , helped the czechs claim the last world cup berth even though they were the last team to qualify for germany 2006 , the czech republic would like to celebrate winning the cup rather than making their first finals appearance as an independent country - their last trip to the finals was as czechoslovakia in italy in 1990 . as czech soccer hero pavel nedved , who came out of international soccer retirement to lead his nation in qualifying for the finals , considers whether he 'll still be fit enough to play next summer , the rest of the team will aim to continue the flowing game they showed during the 2004 european championships , where they staged dramatic come-from-behind wins over germany and the netherlands . with a variety of players spanning from young to old , 22-year-old milan baros , 23-year-old thomas rosicky as well as nedved , 33 , and karel poborsky , 33 , the czechs ' opponents will never know exactly what kind of line-up they could be facing . brazilian fears center on argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina were the first south american team to qualify for the finals often overshadowed by their south american neighbors , argentina have proved to be a team no one wants to face - even brazil 's coach , carlos alberto parreira , admitted they are side he fears most . " if we look at value , i think our number one rivals are argentina for next year 's world cup , " parreira told the gazzetta dello sport . as the first south american team to qualify for next summer 's championships , the argentineans are transitioning and will try to prove they were sent home from the 2002 finals prematurely with a strong showing in germany . " right now , it 's impossible to say what the side will be -lrb- in germany -rrb- , " coach jose pekerman said .
" we have various players in different circumstances , but i 'm satisfied we have a good group . " france uninspiring but still unbeaten bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : les bleus have n't astonished fans despite fielding top players despite being ranked fifth in the world and given relatively good 12-1 odds of winning the tournament , france still ca n't be sure if they will end their germany 2006 campaign raising the cup , as they did at home in 1998 , or returning to disappointed fans after the first rounds without a goal to their name , as happened in the 2002 south korea / japan finals . france features more than enough talent to advance in the contest with the likes of star playmaker zinedine zidane in the midfield and thierry henry and david trezeguet , two of the world 's top strikers , attacking the opponent 's goal , but les bleus often have difficulties converting individual skills into team goals . though raymond domenech 's french side have n't lost in the last 17 games , their workman-like performance of late has been anything but inspiring , and there are plenty of other teams , including perennially strong england , spain and italy , looking to knock down france and the rest of the 2006 favorites . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no clear favorites , according to pele for now , picking the world cup winner remains a guessing game , and even as soccer stars from around the globe throw their support behind various teams , brazilian legend pele -lrb- photo -rrb- reminded the world " it is not always the favorites with the best players that win .

the defending champions scored a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld in extra time , while second place werder bremen tore apart wolfsburg . schalke 04 slipped behind in the title race with a 2-2 draw in cologne , and hertha bsc berlin also were n't able to claim any points in a 0-2 loss to borussia dortmund . at the german top flight 's bottom end , nuremburg won their second match of the season , with a 3-1 victory over kaiserslautern , leaving the " red devils " to prop up all the other 17 bundesliga teams . ballack missing from bayern side peruvian international claudio pizarro saved bayern munich 's blushes by scoring twice in the final eight minutes to make sure bayern maintained their five-point cushion at the bundesliga summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack did his yelling from the bench on saturday sorely missing german national team captain , michael ballack -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose contract saga dominated the headlines throughout the week but was sidelined with a thigh injury , reigning champions bayern looked set to be heading for only their second defeat of the season . bielefeld 's ghanaian international isaac boakye rolled the ball past bayern keeper oliver kahn from close range on the hour mark , but pizarro leveled in the 82nd minute and then scored the winner with the last kick of the match after a mistake in the bielefeld defense . " bielefeld were better than us , " bayern coach felix magath admitted .
" they ruled the game and i really did n't believe we could turn it around after their opening goal . " schalke fall behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen remain in second after beathing wolfsburg it was a vital win for bayern with werder bremen crushing vfl wolfsburg 6-1 at home to stay five points behind the pacesetters .
werder striker and german international miroslav klose scored twice in the second half to take his season 's tally to 14 and extend his lead at the top of the goal scoring charts . " this kind of victory gives our self-confidence a boost , " said bremen trainer thomas schaaf , whose team will be looking for any edge it can get before their european match wednesday against barcelona .
" the team shot some very pretty goals . " with bremen and bayern both winning , last season 's runners-up schalke 04 needed to keep pace but could only manage a 2-2 draw at fc cologne and fall 12 points behind bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's early goal was n't enough to keep schalke ahead of cologne despite a strong start and first half goal from kevin kuranyi , schalke fell behind in the second 45 minutes until ebbe sand poked in the equalizer in the 86th minute . " we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .
if third-placed sv hamburg win at msv duisburg on sunday they will have a six-point cushion over fourth-placed schalke . hertha lose in dortmund … again the westfalen stadium in dortmund remained an unconquerable fortress for hertha berlin .
ebi smolarek scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season in dortmund 's well-deserved win .
hertha 's last victory in dortmund was in 1972 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund tallied another win at home against berlin borussia mönchengladbach will have to continue waiting for their first home win against bayer leverkusen since 1989 after saturday 's 1-1 draw .
leverkusen took the lead in the fifth minute on a simon rolfes goal , but borussia 's eugen polanski was able to level the score nine minutes later . the first bundesliga derby in bruchweg stadium saw mainz 05 and eintracht frankfurt split the spoils in a 2-2 draw . implausibly , three of the four goals came from mainz 's nikolce noveski , who scored two own goals within three minutes of each other then partially made up for the collapse with a goal in the right direction 20 minutes before the final whistle .

after a shaky qualifying start , the defending champions stormed through their final qualifying matches with a limitless supply of offensive talent and solid defense . bookmakers list brazil as 11-4 favorites , and it will be hard for anyone to accuse ricardo teixeira , president of the brazilian soccer federation , of nationalistic pride in stating that his country is currently the world 's best team .

but for many , their dreams of life in the west have soured .
all they want now is to go back home . since the beginning of the 1950 's , over two million ethnic german-russians from the former soviet union have settled in germany .
often , the new start in the land of their ancestors was rough , as many came from impoverished backgrounds and had to make their way in a society - and language - that was foreign . many have successfully made the transition .
but there are those who have given up hope of ever integrating into german life , and are going back home , to places such as russia , kazakhstan or ukraine , even though living conditions are worse there . david ibe , 56 , is just one example .
he brought his family from russia to bonn , germany seven years ago .
in the beginning , things went well .
but now , ibe has decided that he and his wife will return to russia . " i never would have thought that we would go back , " ibe said .
" but in the last three years , the decision has been pressing on me .
our youngest son has just finished his education and gotten married , so now that both our kids are out of the house , my wife and i are going back .
we want to die at home . " the ibes learned german quickly once they arrived , and both found jobs .
despite this , maria ibe says she and her husband never felt at home here . some still feel like foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german-russians feel unwelcome in the land of their ancestors .
" i feel like a foreigner , " she said .
" i still have a complex about the fact that i ca n't speak german like the germans , and never will .
and then there 's the constant tension .
we 're always afraid of putting a foot wrong , afraid of the letters we get from german officials .
and if it happens that you ca n't pay for something here , you 'll be out on the street before you know it .
i 'm just tired of the whole thing . " in their village in nowosibirsk , the couple had their own house complete with a garden and even livestock .
david ibe worked as a truck driver , while maria worked as a gardener in a nursery .
in the 1990 's , life in russia was tough for everyone .
months would go by without receiving a pay check .
and in russia , ethnic germans always felt a bit like outsiders . when germany finally opened its doors to the german-russians , it was hardly surprising that they came in great numbers .
the ibes thought that life in the west would be much easier , especially as they would immediately be granted german citizenship .
they looked forward to finally being in a place they could call home . " we thought we 'd have an easier life here , and no doubt , it has been easier , " david ibe said .
" but here , i 'm a nobody .
and in my village back in russia , i could go out , have a chat with the neighbors - everybody knew everyone else .
i have no relatives in russia now , but i still want to go back to my old village . " no official numbers for those who disappear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses help but many people find integration difficult in germany .
stories such as that of david and maria ibe are only too familiar to the staff of the charitable organization " heimatgarten . "
the charity was originally conceived to help war refugees return home once it was safe .
but recently , more and more german-russians have been looking to the organization for help . " their problems have n't really been recognized , " said heimatgarten staff member zafar sharadzhabow .
" there 's no requirement for them to give notice of their departure .
they can emigrate to any country , and there 's no statistics on it .
we should n't forget that these people grew up under an authoritarian system .
they have constant fear of the state , it 's in their blood .
they do n't want to speak to german officials about what they 're going through . " although there are no official statistics about the number of german-russians who choose to leave germany , sharadzhabow 's own statistics are evidence that the problem does exist .
he has personally received over 300 applications from german-russians asking for assistance .
the most common problem is a lack of money . " most of the families are on welfare , " sharadzhabow said .
" the average family gets about 1,200 euros -lrb- $ 1,400 -rrb- per month from the state .
but if they were to receive several payments at once , say between 3,000 - 5,000 euros , that would be enough for the whole family to go home , find an apartment , find a job .
and then everyone would be happy . " relying on hand-outs that may never come bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of the state makes some afraid of claiming benefits .
but the reality is not that easy .
there 's no law that would permit german civil servants to give german-russian families several welfare payments in a lump sum .
the german state is n't obligated to pay emigration costs for its citizens , which is why most applications for such a handout are turned down .
the ibe family has n't yet gotten a reply to their application , meaning they 're still hopeful that they 'll be successful . " all my thoughts are about my village back home in nowosibirsk , " said david ibe .
" if i were to get the money today , tomorrow i would pack everything up and the day after that , i 'd be gone .
i 'm prepared to give up my german identity card , if only i can leave here .
it was a mistake to come here .
you should just stay where you were born .

the defending champions scored a 2-1 win over arminia bielefeld in extra time , while second place werder bremen tore apart wolfsburg . schalke 04 slipped behind in the title race with a 2-2 draw in cologne , and hertha bsc berlin also were n't able to claim any points in a 0-2 loss to borussia dortmund . at the german top flight 's bottom end , nuremburg won their second match of the season , with a 3-1 victory over kaiserslautern , leaving the " red devils " to prop up all the other 17 bundesliga teams . ballack missing from bayern side peruvian international claudio pizarro saved bayern munich 's blushes by scoring twice in the final eight minutes to make sure bayern maintained their five-point cushion at the bundesliga summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack did his yelling from the bench on saturday sorely missing german national team captain , michael ballack -lrb- photo -rrb- , whose contract saga dominated the headlines throughout the week but was sidelined with a thigh injury , reigning champions bayern looked set to be heading for only their second defeat of the season . bielefeld 's ghanaian international isaac boakye rolled the ball past bayern keeper oliver kahn from close range on the hour mark , but pizarro leveled in the 82nd minute and then scored the winner with the last kick of the match after a mistake in the bielefeld defense . " bielefeld were better than us , " bayern coach felix magath admitted .
" they ruled the game and i really did n't believe we could turn it around after their opening goal . " schalke fall behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen remain in second after beathing wolfsburg it was a vital win for bayern with werder bremen crushing vfl wolfsburg 6-1 at home to stay five points behind the pacesetters .
werder striker and german international miroslav klose scored twice in the second half to take his season 's tally to 14 and extend his lead at the top of the goal scoring charts . " this kind of victory gives our self-confidence a boost , " said bremen trainer thomas schaaf , whose team will be looking for any edge it can get before their european match wednesday against barcelona .
" the team shot some very pretty goals . " with bremen and bayern both winning , last season 's runners-up schalke 04 needed to keep pace but could only manage a 2-2 draw at fc cologne and fall 12 points behind bayern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's early goal was n't enough to keep schalke ahead of cologne despite a strong start and first half goal from kevin kuranyi , schalke fell behind in the second 45 minutes until ebbe sand poked in the equalizer in the 86th minute . " we obviously failed to decide the game in our favor in the first 45 minutes , " said schalke coach ralf rangnick of the many goal opportunities his team missed . even though the loss puts schalke further behind bayern , rangnick will be more concerned with the distance between his side and the three lucrative champions league spots .
if third-placed sv hamburg win at msv duisburg on sunday they will have a six-point cushion over fourth-placed schalke . hertha lose in dortmund … again the westfalen stadium in dortmund remained an unconquerable fortress for hertha berlin .
ebi smolarek scored his 10th and 11th goals of the season in dortmund 's well-deserved win .
hertha 's last victory in dortmund was in 1972 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund tallied another win at home against berlin borussia mönchengladbach will have to continue waiting for their first home win against bayer leverkusen since 1989 after saturday 's 1-1 draw .
leverkusen took the lead in the fifth minute on a simon rolfes goal , but borussia 's eugen polanski was able to level the score nine minutes later . the first bundesliga derby in bruchweg stadium saw mainz 05 and eintracht frankfurt split the spoils in a 2-2 draw . implausibly , three of the four goals came from mainz 's nikolce noveski , who scored two own goals within three minutes of each other then partially made up for the collapse with a goal in the right direction 20 minutes before the final whistle .
petr ruman tied the score for mainz in the match 's final minute . " everything got started in the completely wrong direction , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp .
" it was n't until the second half that we were able to right ourselves . " fourth manager shown to the door bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henke , left , wo n't be around to console kaiserslautern players any longer kaiserslautern wasted little time in sacking coach michael henke after falling to the league basement .
kaiserslautern chairman rene c. jaggi also stepped down from his post after saturday 's defeat . less than an hour after the defeat to nuremberg he became the fourth managerial casualty this season following the departures of klaus augenthaler -lrb- bayer leverkusen -rrb- , wolfgang wolf -lrb- fc nuremberg -rrb- and ewald lienen -lrb- hannover -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de referee gets jail time for match fixing former referee robert hoyzer , who admitted fixing top matches in return for bribes from a croatian mafia ring , was sentenced to two years and five months in jail on thursday .

after a while in the haze and crowded floor of the summit 's ict4all expo space , they start to blur into a colourful mass of e-learning , e-government and e-others .
most of the grassroots projects rely on open-source software as a cheap , if not free , and adaptable resource .
open software is seen as a crucial building block in the creation of a digital society in which everyone , anywhere , can share the knowledge , tools and opportunities that technologies can offer .
knowledge is seen as the font of power and ultimately prosperity in its wider sense .
two very simple and relatively low-tech projects , which focus on the distribution and use of open-source stood out at the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- .
comic turn one was schoolnet namibia , a non-profit group which provides net services , computers , and training to schools in namibia .
it has had great success in supplying and training people on open-source software .
but they found was that after the trainer they provided for two months left the schools , the computers in the labs remained largely untouched , especially by the teachers themselves .
we 've started receiving calls from parents now asking questions about where to save documents they get from the net and so on ebben haotuikulipi , schoolnet namibia " it is no use giving computers away to schools if no one is going to use them , " ebben haotuikulipi from schoolnet namibia explained to the bbc news website .
so in april , they came up with the paper-based hai ti comic , which means listen up in the local language , oshiwambo .
" it is printed every tuesday in the local youth newspaper , so it goes across the country .
what is in the comic is also all online , " said ms haotuikulipi .
the colourful gang of characters explain technology and what it can be used for through stories , just like a conventional comic adventure .
when they talk about e-mail or downloading , for example , information panels near the speech bubbles offer an explanation and web addresses for readers to follow .
the characters are based on actual schoolnet staff members and the comic has been such a hit that they are becoming minor celebrities .
and word is spreading .
" we 've started receiving calls from parents now asking questions about where to save documents they get from the net and so on , so the questions coming into our helpline are now about how to use the computers , " said ms haotuikulipi , which is a sign of real success as far as schoolnet is concerned .
they have also started to receive a lot more e-mails from all over the country since its launch .
the group has also noticed that the teachers , 75 % of whom are women , have been inspired too with a large proportion of helpline calls and e-mails coming from them .
" women and technology have never really got on .
so we did want to get more women into technology too , " said ms haotuikulipi .
" the response has been really good . "
even though it is a young project , it has been recognised by the world summit youth award for bringing technologies closer to people .
toast and source a second eye-catching project is equally simple and is proving to be a big hit , this time in south africa .
the freedom toaster has a touch screen interface the large bright orange vending machine-shaped object looks rather like an internet access kiosk .
then it spits out a cd from one of its four trays .
in fact , it is not linked to the internet at all , and it does not offer you a drink either .
the freedom toaster , a project run by the shuttleworth foundation , is a " bandwidth substitute " .
it requires no infrastructure , just an electricity supply .
it borrows its name from the open-source community 's word for creating or burning a cd , known as " toasting " .
through a simple touch screen interface , it gives the digitally dispossessed in south africa access to open-source software with free licences for those who might have a computer but no net access .
" users come with their own cd , and it will tell you all the information you need about the different software , and asks users what version of software they want and how many cds they want , " explained jason hudson from the shuttleworth foundation .
there are now 30 machines installed in schools , libraries , science centres and retail outlets , and the response has been huge in the year it has been in action .
" it 's been amazing , " says mr hudson .
" it has taken us by surprise .
it started off as an interactive desktop display , but then it just took off . "
all the programs available are stored on its hard drive and eventually the hope is it would be connected to the net , but that is just not possible yet .
tonnes of information the entire unit costs about 17,000 rand -lrb- £ 1,500 -rrb- , the bulk of which is taken up by the cost of the cabinet itself .
inside , it is basically a computer .
the foundation admits that although the toaster does not address the issue of getting computers into impoverished areas , it does provide a way of plugging into the wealth of information the net offers .
in true open-source spirit , the blueprints of how to build a freedom toaster are being made available in freedom toaster cookbook , which will be available from march 2006 .
jimmy wales , founder of the collaborative , open , online wikipedia encyclopaedia , said the toaster is exactly the kind of distribution channel that a resource such as wikipedia could use .
" the ability to go and download a cd and have tonnes of information on it is really important , " he told the bbc news website .

most of the grassroots projects rely on open-source software as a cheap , if not free , and adaptable resource .
open software is seen as a crucial building block in the creation of a digital society in which everyone , anywhere , can share the knowledge , tools and opportunities that technologies can offer .
knowledge is seen as the font of power and ultimately prosperity in its wider sense .
two very simple and relatively low-tech projects , which focus on the distribution and use of open-source stood out at the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- .
comic turn one was schoolnet namibia , a non-profit group which provides net services , computers , and training to schools in namibia .
it has had great success in supplying and training people on open-source software .
but they found was that after the trainer they provided for two months left the schools , the computers in the labs remained largely untouched , especially by the teachers themselves .
we 've started receiving calls from parents now asking questions about where to save documents they get from the net and so on ebben haotuikulipi , schoolnet namibia " it is no use giving computers away to schools if no one is going to use them , " ebben haotuikulipi from schoolnet namibia explained to the bbc news website .
so in april , they came up with the paper-based hai ti comic , which means listen up in the local language , oshiwambo .
" it is printed every tuesday in the local youth newspaper , so it goes across the country .
what is in the comic is also all online , " said ms haotuikulipi .
the colourful gang of characters explain technology and what it can be used for through stories , just like a conventional comic adventure .
when they talk about e-mail or downloading , for example , information panels near the speech bubbles offer an explanation and web addresses for readers to follow .
the characters are based on actual schoolnet staff members and the comic has been such a hit that they are becoming minor celebrities .
and word is spreading .
" we 've started receiving calls from parents now asking questions about where to save documents they get from the net and so on , so the questions coming into our helpline are now about how to use the computers , " said ms haotuikulipi , which is a sign of real success as far as schoolnet is concerned .
they have also started to receive a lot more e-mails from all over the country since its launch .
the group has also noticed that the teachers , 75 % of whom are women , have been inspired too with a large proportion of helpline calls and e-mails coming from them .
" women and technology have never really got on .
so we did want to get more women into technology too , " said ms haotuikulipi .
" the response has been really good . "
even though it is a young project , it has been recognised by the world summit youth award for bringing technologies closer to people .
toast and source a second eye-catching project is equally simple and is proving to be a big hit , this time in south africa .
the freedom toaster has a touch screen interface the large bright orange vending machine-shaped object looks rather like an internet access kiosk .
then it spits out a cd from one of its four trays .
in fact , it is not linked to the internet at all , and it does not offer you a drink either .
the freedom toaster , a project run by the shuttleworth foundation , is a " bandwidth substitute " .
it requires no infrastructure , just an electricity supply .
it borrows its name from the open-source community 's word for creating or burning a cd , known as " toasting " .
through a simple touch screen interface , it gives the digitally dispossessed in south africa access to open-source software with free licences for those who might have a computer but no net access .
" users come with their own cd , and it will tell you all the information you need about the different software , and asks users what version of software they want and how many cds they want , " explained jason hudson from the shuttleworth foundation .
there are now 30 machines installed in schools , libraries , science centres and retail outlets , and the response has been huge in the year it has been in action .
" it 's been amazing , " says mr hudson .
" it has taken us by surprise .
it started off as an interactive desktop display , but then it just took off . "
all the programs available are stored on its hard drive and eventually the hope is it would be connected to the net , but that is just not possible yet .
tonnes of information the entire unit costs about 17,000 rand -lrb- £ 1,500 -rrb- , the bulk of which is taken up by the cost of the cabinet itself .

the foundation admits that although the toaster does not address the issue of getting computers into impoverished areas , it does provide a way of plugging into the wealth of information the net offers .
in true open-source spirit , the blueprints of how to build a freedom toaster are being made available in freedom toaster cookbook , which will be available from march 2006 .
jimmy wales , founder of the collaborative , open , online wikipedia encyclopaedia , said the toaster is exactly the kind of distribution channel that a resource such as wikipedia could use .
" the ability to go and download a cd and have tonnes of information on it is really important , " he told the bbc news website .

after a while in the haze and crowded floor of the summit 's ict4all expo space , they start to blur into a colourful mass of e-learning , e-government and e-others .
most of the grassroots projects rely on open-source software as a cheap , if not free , and adaptable resource .
open software is seen as a crucial building block in the creation of a digital society in which everyone , anywhere , can share the knowledge , tools and opportunities that technologies can offer .
knowledge is seen as the font of power and ultimately prosperity in its wider sense .
two very simple and relatively low-tech projects , which focus on the distribution and use of open-source stood out at the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- .
comic turn one was schoolnet namibia , a non-profit group which provides net services , computers , and training to schools in namibia .
it has had great success in supplying and training people on open-source software .
but they found was that after the trainer they provided for two months left the schools , the computers in the labs remained largely untouched , especially by the teachers themselves . "
we 've started receiving calls from parents now asking questions about where to save documents they get from the net and so on " ebben haotuikulipi , schoolnet namibia " it is no use giving computers away to schools if no one is going to use them , " ebben haotuikulipi from schoolnet namibia explained to the bbc news website .
so in april , they came up with the paper-based hai ti comic , which means listen up in the local language , oshiwambo .
" it is printed every tuesday in the local youth newspaper , so it goes across the country .
what is in the comic is also all online , " said ms haotuikulipi .
the colourful gang of characters explain technology and what it can be used for through stories , just like a conventional comic adventure .
when they talk about e-mail or downloading , for example , information panels near the speech bubbles offer an explanation and web addresses for readers to follow .
the characters are based on actual schoolnet staff members and the comic has been such a hit that they are becoming minor celebrities .
and word is spreading .
" we 've started receiving calls from parents now asking questions about where to save documents they get from the net and so on , so the questions coming into our helpline are now about how to use the computers , " said ms haotuikulipi , which is a sign of real success as far as schoolnet is concerned .
they have also started to receive a lot more e-mails from all over the country since its launch .
the group has also noticed that the teachers , 75 % of whom are women , have been inspired too with a large proportion of helpline calls and e-mails coming from them .
" women and technology have never really got on .
so we did want to get more women into technology too , " said ms haotuikulipi .
" the response has been really good . "
even though it is a young project , it has been recognised by the world summit youth award for bringing technologies closer to people .
toast and source a second eye-catching project is equally simple and is proving to be a big hit , this time in south africa .
the large bright orange vending machine-shaped object looks rather like an internet access kiosk .
then it spits out a cd from one of its four trays .
in fact , it is not linked to the internet at all , and it does not offer you a drink either .
the freedom toaster , a project run by the shuttleworth foundation , is a " bandwidth substitute " .
it requires no infrastructure , just an electricity supply .
it borrows its name from the open-source community 's word for creating or burning a cd , known as " toasting " .
through a simple touch screen interface , it gives the digitally dispossessed in south africa access to open-source software with free licences for those who might have a computer but no net access .
" users come with their own cd , and it will tell you all the information you need about the different software , and asks users what version of software they want and how many cds they want , " explained jason hudson from the shuttleworth foundation .
there are now 30 machines installed in schools , libraries , science centres and retail outlets , and the response has been huge in the year it has been in action .
" it 's been amazing , " says mr hudson .
" it has taken us by surprise .
it started off as an interactive desktop display , but then it just took off . "
all the programs available are stored on its hard drive and eventually the hope is it would be connected to the net , but that is just not possible yet .
tonnes of information the entire unit costs about 17,000 rand -lrb- £ 1,500 -rrb- , the bulk of which is taken up by the cost of the cabinet itself .
inside , it is basically a computer .

herbert davies , 94 , and his wife margaret , 89 , from llandrindod wells in powys , said they were told it could take six months before it is fixed .
the lift in the victorian building has already been out of action for three months , leaving the pair stranded in their home of 50 years .
powys council is " working hard to solve the problem as quickly as possible " .
friends and relatives of the couple have been forced to deliver the couple 's shopping to their flat in the historic , council-owned gwalia building .
the building is listed for its historic interest , which means repairs have to be carried out in accordance with strict guidelines .
three flights of stairs separate the couple from the outside world and mrs davies said she had only managed to go out a couple of times to shop .
she said climbing the stairs with bags of shopping was " very difficult " for someone of her age .
we are virtually prisoners in our own home margaret davies mr davies , a former council caretaker , was given the three-bedroom flat with his job and stayed on when he retired .
powys council said repairs would be completed " as quickly as possible " , but added that changes to a listed building had to be carried out " sympathetically " .
mrs davies said : " the lift broke down about three months ago and i 've gone out a few times , but i find it very difficult climbing the stairs with all the shopping .
" i 've stopped doing it now and family and friends have been helping , but i feel guilty asking them . "
former royal navy sailor mr davies , who was a japanese prisoner of war , had to be carried out of his flat by paramedics recently when he needed hospital treatment .
mr davies worked as a council caretaker in llandrindod wells " we are virtually prisoners in our own home , " said mrs davies .
" we did used to go out walking before the lift broke down , but now we 're house bound .
" we 've been told it could be six months until the lift is fixed . "
a council spokeswoman said : " the lift is more than 50 years old and has needed considerable maintenance in the past just to keep it working .
" recently , however , it has suffered major problems and can not be used for health and safety reasons .
the council is looking to replace the lift .
" removing a lift and installing a replacement in a listed building is a specialist task and unfortunately is unlikely to be completed for several months . "

speaking out although the information society is about people and what they do with technologies , there still remain critical technical issues that need to be tackled head on .
much of the summit , the single biggest thing to happen to tunisia in recent history , was dominated by whether the us should keep technical control of the net and freedom of speech on the net .
one of the highlights was the debut of the mit $ 100 laptop the issue was resolved partially in a compromise solution to set up an international forum to look at issues such as cyber security issues .

" the net is not just one internet controlled by one centre , regionalisation has already started and i suspect that in a few years , the scenery of the internet will be a quite different one , " commented mr utsumi .
this worries many .
they fear giving over this type of control at a government level compromises the net 's legacy of liberal , loose , grass roots lifeblood that feeds on debate , diversity , opinion and opposition .
those sitting in booths on the expo floor at the summit were probably more concerned with how they will be able to afford to keep the hardware they have worked so hard to get up-to-date ..
