george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped . the last week has been the most difficult in george w. bush 's presidency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl did n't want his stasi files to be made public many have drawn parallels between gysi 's case and that of former chancellor helmut kohl who spent years fighting to have his stasi file suppressed .
last year , a court ruled that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the former leader . but speaking in berlin on monday , birthler said the two cases had nothing in common with one another , arguing that kohl had been a victim of stasi subterfuge , whereas gysi appeared to have been a collaborator . hendrik thalheim , left party spokesman defended gysi 's efforts to keep his file under wraps by pointing out that the files in question were primarily about robert havemann , and gysi 's were therefore not the only interests at stake . " gregor gysi is sworn to professional secrecy and can not allow publication , " he said . an accurate understanding of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenting the history of a communist dictatorship : the stasi archive sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , interest in the stasi 's extensive archives remains voracious .
some 1.5 million people have requested access to their documents , a figure that marianne birthler described monday as " the most astonishing result of our work . " the era of spectacular revelations might be over , she said , but a day-to-day dealing with the past is as important as ever . " in an age when public awareness of the mundane breaches of privacy and freedom under a dictatorship are fading all the time and the image of east germany is becoming increasingly harmless , " birthler said , " an accurate understanding of history with the help of stasi documentation is ever more crucial .

the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl did n't want his stasi files to be made public many have drawn parallels between gysi 's case and that of former chancellor helmut kohl who spent years fighting to have his stasi file suppressed .
last year , a court ruled that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the former leader . but speaking in berlin on monday , birthler said the two cases had nothing in common with one another , arguing that kohl had been a victim of stasi subterfuge , whereas gysi appeared to have been a collaborator . hendrik thalheim , left party spokesman defended gysi 's efforts to keep his file under wraps by pointing out that the files in question were primarily about robert havemann , and gysi 's were therefore not the only interests at stake . " gregor gysi is sworn to professional secrecy and can not allow publication , " he said . an accurate understanding of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenting the history of a communist dictatorship : the stasi archive sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , interest in the stasi 's extensive archives remains voracious .
some 1.5 million people have requested access to their documents , a figure that marianne birthler described monday as " the most astonishing result of our work . " the era of spectacular revelations might be over , she said , but a day-to-day dealing with the past is as important as ever . " in an age when public awareness of the mundane breaches of privacy and freedom under a dictatorship are fading all the time and the image of east germany is becoming increasingly harmless , " birthler said , " an accurate understanding of history with the help of stasi documentation is ever more crucial .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 the fight against the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are present - and more and more accepted general elections are less than two weeks off .
neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "
cds to the under-20 set , in the hope of turning their ears away from the hate-filled rhetoric of the far-right . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israeli president warns against far-right on the second day of his state visit , israeli president moshe katsav warned in a speech to the german parliament tuesday that the jewish state was concerned by the resurgence of neo-nazis in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 the fight against the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are present - and more and more accepted general elections are less than two weeks off .
neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "
cds to the under-20 set , in the hope of turning their ears away from the hate-filled rhetoric of the far-right . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israeli president warns against far-right on the second day of his state visit , israeli president moshe katsav warned in a speech to the german parliament tuesday that the jewish state was concerned by the resurgence of neo-nazis in germany .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .
the large-scale destruction of our environment means more poverty , particularly in the third world , and if we do n't heed this lesson , we 'll never be able to reach the un millennium goal of halving poverty in the world by 2015 . " time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .
" a more diversified fuel supply that includes technologies like cleaner coal and renewables alongside greater energy efficiency makes economic as well as environmental sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .
she said economic growth for the sake of growth alone would n't lead anywhere , particularly if it entailed the uncurbed depletion of natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for far too long we have labored under the impression that there 's no such thing as environmental capital .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .
the large-scale destruction of our environment means more poverty , particularly in the third world , and if we do n't heed this lesson , we 'll never be able to reach the un millennium goal of halving poverty in the world by 2015 . " time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .
" a more diversified fuel supply that includes technologies like cleaner coal and renewables alongside greater energy efficiency makes economic as well as environmental sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .
she said economic growth for the sake of growth alone would n't lead anywhere , particularly if it entailed the uncurbed depletion of natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for far too long we have labored under the impression that there 's no such thing as environmental capital .
people believed that natural resources can be used for free without anything being reinvested .
but now we can see very clearly that this attitude makes sustainable growth impossible , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government fears high oil prices german economy minister wolfgang clement reiterated concern monday about the negative economic effects of the latest surge in oil prices .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .
18 , transatlantic relations will probably become friendlier .

neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .

together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .

" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .

we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "

no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped . the last week has been the most difficult in george w. bush 's presidency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .
over the past weekend , germany sent two planes loaded with 25 tons of food rations to a us air force base in florida for further distribution to the gulf coast states of louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
another flight carrying 15 tons is scheduled to be delivered on tuesday .

it 's wonderful , " said john turner who 's in charge of the american disaster prevention association .
in a letter to german chancellor gerhard schröder , president bush wrote that millions of americans were grateful for the assistance from germany .
" it shows the generosity of the german people and government .
it is a testimony to the human spirit as well as to the bonds between our nations , " bush wrote .
technical help desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple cries just before their potential rescue from the new orleans convention center beyond food aid , us ambassador to germany , william timken , has issued a " wish list " of technical assistance required by the battered coastal states . it includes items such as generators , emergency shelters , pumps , water purification systems , blankets , medicine , search and rescue teams , logistical experts and vaccination teams .
frank-walter steinmeier , head of the chancellor 's office , said this corresponded with items that germany had offered .
in addition , a medical ship is in the atlantic on its way to egypt for an exercise but could be redirected anytime to the hurricane-stricken region .
eu , nato and un all responding the eu is also responding generously to the united states ' call for aid for the victims of katrina .
britain alone plans to send 15 planes this week and might extend the operation - with a sea shipment - to provide blankets , tents and cooking equipment .

george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped . the last week has been the most difficult in george w. bush 's presidency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .
over the past weekend , germany sent two planes loaded with 25 tons of food rations to a us air force base in florida for further distribution to the gulf coast states of louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
another flight carrying 15 tons is scheduled to be delivered on tuesday .

frank-walter steinmeier , head of the chancellor 's office , said this corresponded with items that germany had offered .
in addition , a medical ship is in the atlantic on its way to egypt for an exercise but could be redirected anytime to the hurricane-stricken region .
eu , nato and un all responding the eu is also responding generously to the united states ' call for aid for the victims of katrina .
britain alone plans to send 15 planes this week and might extend the operation - with a sea shipment - to provide blankets , tents and cooking equipment .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 magdeburg 's pink palace of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg hopes its green citadel will polish up the town 's image east german cities such as magdeburg grapple with high unemployment and poor prospects and have been struggling since german reunification to turn themselves around , sometimes in creative ways . it rises unexpectedly among the city ’ s few remaining historic buildings , all pink and curvy and whimsically ornamented , almost like a child ’ s drawing come to life .
almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .

it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .
it 's a bit of campaign stop but with constrction schedule for completion in 2010 , angela merkel and germany also stand to benefit from the plans . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .

oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 voting machines still rare in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike most americans , germans generally write on their ballots several million germans will be using machines to cast their votes on sept .
18 .
but many still eye the method with suspicion .
so far , only one company has managed to comply with germany 's stringent rules . when germans head to the polls on sept .
18 to decide who will be their new chancellor , many voters wo n't place their mark on a ballot paper .
instead , they will be confronted with a primitive keyboard and a little screen not unlike those that were pictured in the news surrounding the chaotic vote count in the 2000 us presidential elections . about five million germans out of almost 62 million eligible voters will be using electronic voting machines -lrb- evms -rrb- : 65 municipalities have decided to use evms this time round and a total of some 2,100 evms will be in operation . " the decision of whether and what type of voting technology to use is entirely that of the towns and local authorities that administer the respective electoral districts , " said a spokesman for the federal elections director .
the only condition is that vote counting complies with the extensive rules on security and verification that are part of the federal election laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mechanical voting machines are used in the southwestern state of saarland " these rules comprise over a hundred pages - enough to make most vendors of voting technology turn on their heels and walk out of the door , " said thomas bronder who works for the physikalisch-tech n ische bu n desa n stalt .
the federal agency normally tests one-armed bandits and gambling machinery to ensure they have not been fixed to unduly rip-off soldiers of fortune .
but the agency also tests evms for compliance with the stringent federal rules . so far only one model - the " esd " voting machine produced by a dutch company - has been approved and will be used in the forthcoming elections . o n ly basic machi n es allowed on the surface it looks similar to other voting machines .
it has a simple keyboard consisting of buttons that are embedded in a mask depicting an actual paper ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her vote via voting machine in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt in the 2002 election a person intending to vote for a particular candidate or party simply presses the button located next to her choice .
a small screen then confirms the choice and the ballot is cast and stored electronically on a memory module .
when voting closes at 6 p.m. , every machine prints out the number of votes cast for each party or candidate . what makes this machine very different are the goings-on inside .
and they are anything but high-tech . primitive technology ? " the law demands that voting machines do not contain any technology or functionality beyond the bare minimum needed to fulfill its task of tallying votes , " bronder said . this rules out any pc-based machinery .
evms are also not allowed to run extensive operating systems like windows .
that 's because microsoft keeps the source code under lock and key and so it can not be inspected . the esd machine tested by bronder is more of an electronic counting machine rather than a computer used to count votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machine in the us " we spent over a year testing the software and frequently got back to the manufacturer demanding changes which they quickly implemented , " he said .
" the data transmitted onto the memory modules is so primitive - you could n't even call it programming - that it 's basically impossible to influence the vote by loading manipulated data onto the memory modules .
it would show up immediately and the voting machine would shut down . " security co n cer n s but what guarantee do bronder and his colleagues have that all evms are the same as the prototype they tested so thoroughly ? " a combination of known checksums tells the local voting administrators about the version of the software running in a particular machine , " bronder said , adding that the checksums would be changed by manipulations . and while this is not a definite guarantee , " why would a company deliberately manipulate and run the risk of ruining their hard earned reputation after getting approval for the strict rules of the german market ? " he said . so , all is well and safe then ?
not quite , said hubertus buchstein , professor of politics at greifswald university in northeastern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots on new touch screen voting machines in georgia " the machines produce no paper trail , " he said .
this is a problem that had also gained notoriety in the context of the use of evms in the us .
lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast . the way of the future ? a solution could be that individual paper receipts confirming the vote are shown to the voter before being dumped in a separate ballot box . " these would only need to be counted if controversy arose about the result spewed out by the electronic tally , " buchstein said . also , random checks in a number of voting districts across the country could be used to make sure the stored vote count matches the paper trail .
only in these cases a parallel count of the paper ballot would be necessary , still saving the enormous cost of manually counting paper ballots for the whole electorate . voting via the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will people be able to vote via cell phone text messages while on vacation in the future ?
cost reduction is just one motive for towns and local authorities to switch to evms .
in the long term this could be followed by a move towards " online-voting , " buchstein said . " voting from the comfort of your home via internet or cell phone text messaging could help tap into new voter contingents , " he said .
but security remains the overwhelming obstacle to realizing this vision just yet . ranty islam , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .

neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .

national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .

since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .

george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped . the last week has been the most difficult in george w. bush 's presidency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .
over the past weekend , germany sent two planes loaded with 25 tons of food rations to a us air force base in florida for further distribution to the gulf coast states of louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
another flight carrying 15 tons is scheduled to be delivered on tuesday .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .

" time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .
" a more diversified fuel supply that includes technologies like cleaner coal and renewables alongside greater energy efficiency makes economic as well as environmental sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 ambitious energy project in the pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas could travel from russia to germany - underwater a joint german and russian project is en-route to build one of the most ambitious pipelines ever .
it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .
it 's a bit of campaign stop but with constrction schedule for completion in 2010 , angela merkel and germany also stand to benefit from the plans . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .
it 's a bit of campaign stop but with constrction schedule for completion in 2010 , angela merkel and germany also stand to benefit from the plans . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .
-lrb- march 1 , 2005 -rrb- energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad .

instead , they will be confronted with a primitive keyboard and a little screen not unlike those that were pictured in the news surrounding the chaotic vote count in the 2000 us presidential elections . about five million germans out of almost 62 million eligible voters will be using electronic voting machines -lrb- evms -rrb- : 65 municipalities have decided to use evms this time round and a total of some 2,100 evms will be in operation . " the decision of whether and what type of voting technology to use is entirely that of the towns and local authorities that administer the respective electoral districts , " said a spokesman for the federal elections director .
the only condition is that vote counting complies with the extensive rules on security and verification that are part of the federal election laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mechanical voting machines are used in the southwestern state of saarland " these rules comprise over a hundred pages - enough to make most vendors of voting technology turn on their heels and walk out of the door , " said thomas bronder who works for the physikalisch-tech n ische bu n desa n stalt .
the federal agency normally tests one-armed bandits and gambling machinery to ensure they have not been fixed to unduly rip-off soldiers of fortune .
but the agency also tests evms for compliance with the stringent federal rules . so far only one model - the " esd " voting machine produced by a dutch company - has been approved and will be used in the forthcoming elections . o n ly basic machi n es allowed on the surface it looks similar to other voting machines .

" these would only need to be counted if controversy arose about the result spewed out by the electronic tally , " buchstein said . also , random checks in a number of voting districts across the country could be used to make sure the stored vote count matches the paper trail .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .
" our clients are interested in such " crazy " projects as the green citadel , " said marcus tolle , managing director of wisa gmbh , an agency that encourages investment in saxony-anhalt .
" soft factors " sometimes play a significant role in investment decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 new us envoy tries to mend ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no diplomatic experience but good intentions the new us ambassador to germany is trying to strengthen transatlantic relations .
but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .
18 , transatlantic relations will probably become friendlier .
timken has already met with foreign ministry officials to coordinate german aid to the victims of hurricane katrina . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto intervenes in us-eu aircraft dispute the world trade organisation agreed on wednesday to rule on the dispute between the united states and the european union over billions of dollars in public aid for aircraft makers boeing and airbus .

neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 the fight against the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are present - and more and more accepted general elections are less than two weeks off .
neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .
the large-scale destruction of our environment means more poverty , particularly in the third world , and if we do n't heed this lesson , we 'll never be able to reach the un millennium goal of halving poverty in the world by 2015 . " time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .
" a more diversified fuel supply that includes technologies like cleaner coal and renewables alongside greater energy efficiency makes economic as well as environmental sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .
she said economic growth for the sake of growth alone would n't lead anywhere , particularly if it entailed the uncurbed depletion of natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for far too long we have labored under the impression that there 's no such thing as environmental capital .
people believed that natural resources can be used for free without anything being reinvested .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl did n't want his stasi files to be made public many have drawn parallels between gysi 's case and that of former chancellor helmut kohl who spent years fighting to have his stasi file suppressed .
last year , a court ruled that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the former leader . but speaking in berlin on monday , birthler said the two cases had nothing in common with one another , arguing that kohl had been a victim of stasi subterfuge , whereas gysi appeared to have been a collaborator . hendrik thalheim , left party spokesman defended gysi 's efforts to keep his file under wraps by pointing out that the files in question were primarily about robert havemann , and gysi 's were therefore not the only interests at stake . " gregor gysi is sworn to professional secrecy and can not allow publication , " he said . an accurate understanding of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenting the history of a communist dictatorship : the stasi archive sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , interest in the stasi 's extensive archives remains voracious .
some 1.5 million people have requested access to their documents , a figure that marianne birthler described monday as " the most astonishing result of our work . " the era of spectacular revelations might be over , she said , but a day-to-day dealing with the past is as important as ever . " in an age when public awareness of the mundane breaches of privacy and freedom under a dictatorship are fading all the time and the image of east germany is becoming increasingly harmless , " birthler said , " an accurate understanding of history with the help of stasi documentation is ever more crucial .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .
" our clients are interested in such " crazy " projects as the green citadel , " said marcus tolle , managing director of wisa gmbh , an agency that encourages investment in saxony-anhalt .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 volkswagen announces job cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw is set to slim down its payroll volkswagen has confirmed plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs in germany .
the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?
germany produces some 5.5 million cars every year , but the german car industry is most likely to remember 2004 for poor sales and industrial strikes .
can it be salvaged ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 magdeburg 's pink palace of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdeburg hopes its green citadel will polish up the town 's image east german cities such as magdeburg grapple with high unemployment and poor prospects and have been struggling since german reunification to turn themselves around , sometimes in creative ways . it rises unexpectedly among the city ’ s few remaining historic buildings , all pink and curvy and whimsically ornamented , almost like a child ’ s drawing come to life .
almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .
" our clients are interested in such " crazy " projects as the green citadel , " said marcus tolle , managing director of wisa gmbh , an agency that encourages investment in saxony-anhalt .
" soft factors " sometimes play a significant role in investment decisions .

george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped . the last week has been the most difficult in george w. bush 's presidency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .
over the past weekend , germany sent two planes loaded with 25 tons of food rations to a us air force base in florida for further distribution to the gulf coast states of louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
another flight carrying 15 tons is scheduled to be delivered on tuesday .

in a letter to german chancellor gerhard schröder , president bush wrote that millions of americans were grateful for the assistance from germany .
" it shows the generosity of the german people and government .
it is a testimony to the human spirit as well as to the bonds between our nations , " bush wrote .

frank-walter steinmeier , head of the chancellor 's office , said this corresponded with items that germany had offered .
in addition , a medical ship is in the atlantic on its way to egypt for an exercise but could be redirected anytime to the hurricane-stricken region .
eu , nato and un all responding the eu is also responding generously to the united states ' call for aid for the victims of katrina .
britain alone plans to send 15 planes this week and might extend the operation - with a sea shipment - to provide blankets , tents and cooking equipment .

no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .

despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .

it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .

the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .

nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 new us envoy tries to mend ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no diplomatic experience but good intentions the new us ambassador to germany is trying to strengthen transatlantic relations .
but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl did n't want his stasi files to be made public many have drawn parallels between gysi 's case and that of former chancellor helmut kohl who spent years fighting to have his stasi file suppressed .
last year , a court ruled that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the former leader . but speaking in berlin on monday , birthler said the two cases had nothing in common with one another , arguing that kohl had been a victim of stasi subterfuge , whereas gysi appeared to have been a collaborator . hendrik thalheim , left party spokesman defended gysi 's efforts to keep his file under wraps by pointing out that the files in question were primarily about robert havemann , and gysi 's were therefore not the only interests at stake . " gregor gysi is sworn to professional secrecy and can not allow publication , " he said . an accurate understanding of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenting the history of a communist dictatorship : the stasi archive sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , interest in the stasi 's extensive archives remains voracious .
some 1.5 million people have requested access to their documents , a figure that marianne birthler described monday as " the most astonishing result of our work . " the era of spectacular revelations might be over , she said , but a day-to-day dealing with the past is as important as ever . " in an age when public awareness of the mundane breaches of privacy and freedom under a dictatorship are fading all the time and the image of east germany is becoming increasingly harmless , " birthler said , " an accurate understanding of history with the help of stasi documentation is ever more crucial .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl did n't want his stasi files to be made public many have drawn parallels between gysi 's case and that of former chancellor helmut kohl who spent years fighting to have his stasi file suppressed .
last year , a court ruled that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the former leader . but speaking in berlin on monday , birthler said the two cases had nothing in common with one another , arguing that kohl had been a victim of stasi subterfuge , whereas gysi appeared to have been a collaborator . hendrik thalheim , left party spokesman defended gysi 's efforts to keep his file under wraps by pointing out that the files in question were primarily about robert havemann , and gysi 's were therefore not the only interests at stake . " gregor gysi is sworn to professional secrecy and can not allow publication , " he said . an accurate understanding of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenting the history of a communist dictatorship : the stasi archive sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , interest in the stasi 's extensive archives remains voracious .
some 1.5 million people have requested access to their documents , a figure that marianne birthler described monday as " the most astonishing result of our work . " the era of spectacular revelations might be over , she said , but a day-to-day dealing with the past is as important as ever . " in an age when public awareness of the mundane breaches of privacy and freedom under a dictatorship are fading all the time and the image of east germany is becoming increasingly harmless , " birthler said , " an accurate understanding of history with the help of stasi documentation is ever more crucial .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 the fight against the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are present - and more and more accepted general elections are less than two weeks off .
neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "
cds to the under-20 set , in the hope of turning their ears away from the hate-filled rhetoric of the far-right . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israeli president warns against far-right on the second day of his state visit , israeli president moshe katsav warned in a speech to the german parliament tuesday that the jewish state was concerned by the resurgence of neo-nazis in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 the fight against the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are present - and more and more accepted general elections are less than two weeks off .
neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "
cds to the under-20 set , in the hope of turning their ears away from the hate-filled rhetoric of the far-right . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israeli president warns against far-right on the second day of his state visit , israeli president moshe katsav warned in a speech to the german parliament tuesday that the jewish state was concerned by the resurgence of neo-nazis in germany .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 the fight against the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis are present - and more and more accepted general elections are less than two weeks off .
neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd demonstration in oldenburg " studies have shown that many first-time voters have internalized right-wing attitudes .
politicians were asleep while extremists cultivated young people systematically with music , youth clubs and activities , " thierse criticized .
the sociologist wilhelm heitmeyer has pointed out that more and more people are accepting the right-wing mentality as normal .
" there is a rise in the population as a whole , particularly in when it comes to sensitive things like xenophobia .
it 's less among youths than among older people , " heitmeyer said , warning that right-wing extremism should n't be considered a problem solely amongst adolescents .
meanwhile , ravindra gujjula 's group has distributed over 16,000 of 20,000 " hörbar tolerant ! "

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .
the large-scale destruction of our environment means more poverty , particularly in the third world , and if we do n't heed this lesson , we 'll never be able to reach the un millennium goal of halving poverty in the world by 2015 . " time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .
" a more diversified fuel supply that includes technologies like cleaner coal and renewables alongside greater energy efficiency makes economic as well as environmental sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .
she said economic growth for the sake of growth alone would n't lead anywhere , particularly if it entailed the uncurbed depletion of natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for far too long we have labored under the impression that there 's no such thing as environmental capital .
people believed that natural resources can be used for free without anything being reinvested .
but now we can see very clearly that this attitude makes sustainable growth impossible , " she said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government fears high oil prices german economy minister wolfgang clement reiterated concern monday about the negative economic effects of the latest surge in oil prices .

the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .
it 's a bit of campaign stop but with constrction schedule for completion in 2010 , angela merkel and germany also stand to benefit from the plans . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .

nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .

gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 new us envoy tries to mend ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no diplomatic experience but good intentions the new us ambassador to germany is trying to strengthen transatlantic relations .
but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german businesses being hurt by protective tariffs " timken , one of the biggest beneficiaries of a trade policy that violates the -lrb- world trade organization -rrb- ruling , has been named ambassador to a country whose businesses suffer as a result of this policy , " jürgen geissinger , ceo of the schaeffler group and president of the federation of european bearing manufacturers association told german news magazine der spiegel .
timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .
but speaking at his senate confirmation hearings in july , he said his key priority was " strengthening business confidence and promoting american exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german election will impact transatlantic relations that task has become a little tougher since the eu slapped american imports with special tariffs in may .
but if conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel wins on sept .
18 , transatlantic relations will probably become friendlier .
timken has already met with foreign ministry officials to coordinate german aid to the victims of hurricane katrina . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto intervenes in us-eu aircraft dispute the world trade organisation agreed on wednesday to rule on the dispute between the united states and the european union over billions of dollars in public aid for aircraft makers boeing and airbus .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .

timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .
but his detractors from within the former dissident scene are still convinced gysi was working together with the stasi , and eagerly await the inevitable investigation gysi will face if he enters parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl did n't want his stasi files to be made public many have drawn parallels between gysi 's case and that of former chancellor helmut kohl who spent years fighting to have his stasi file suppressed .
last year , a court ruled that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the former leader . but speaking in berlin on monday , birthler said the two cases had nothing in common with one another , arguing that kohl had been a victim of stasi subterfuge , whereas gysi appeared to have been a collaborator . hendrik thalheim , left party spokesman defended gysi 's efforts to keep his file under wraps by pointing out that the files in question were primarily about robert havemann , and gysi 's were therefore not the only interests at stake . " gregor gysi is sworn to professional secrecy and can not allow publication , " he said . an accurate understanding of history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenting the history of a communist dictatorship : the stasi archive sixteen years after the fall of the berlin wall , interest in the stasi 's extensive archives remains voracious .
some 1.5 million people have requested access to their documents , a figure that marianne birthler described monday as " the most astonishing result of our work . " the era of spectacular revelations might be over , she said , but a day-to-day dealing with the past is as important as ever . " in an age when public awareness of the mundane breaches of privacy and freedom under a dictatorship are fading all the time and the image of east germany is becoming increasingly harmless , " birthler said , " an accurate understanding of history with the help of stasi documentation is ever more crucial .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .

he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .

in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .
the large-scale destruction of our environment means more poverty , particularly in the third world , and if we do n't heed this lesson , we 'll never be able to reach the un millennium goal of halving poverty in the world by 2015 . " time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .
" a more diversified fuel supply that includes technologies like cleaner coal and renewables alongside greater energy efficiency makes economic as well as environmental sense . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .
she said economic growth for the sake of growth alone would n't lead anywhere , particularly if it entailed the uncurbed depletion of natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for far too long we have labored under the impression that there 's no such thing as environmental capital .
people believed that natural resources can be used for free without anything being reinvested .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .

" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .

younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .

in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .

it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .

bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .
" our clients are interested in such " crazy " projects as the green citadel , " said marcus tolle , managing director of wisa gmbh , an agency that encourages investment in saxony-anhalt .
" soft factors " sometimes play a significant role in investment decisions .

neo-nazi parties have practically no chance of exceeding the five percent clause to get into parliament , but nevertheless the fight against the right goes on . in the small brandenburg hamlet of altlandsberg , ravindra gujjula has taken on the task of fighting radicals from the right-wing scene .
but then , that 's partly his job .
born in india , gujjula is now the mayor of altlandsberg , and the head of the anti-right club " brandenburg against rightists . "
gujjula is aware that he sticks out in the eastern german village he governs , but he keeps a cool head to counteract the xenophobic rhetoric of the local adolescents .
" did you know that 7,000 foreign computer specialists with german green cards , created 33,000 new jobs for germans within six months ? " he frequently asks young people in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cds from bands loved by neo-nazi supporters gujjula told the märkische oderzeitung that the club concentrates on getting the message against neo-nazism out to youths between the ages of 14 to 17 .
to help , he decided to use the same medium often employed by neo-nazis to reach disenchanted youths - music .
together with prominent german rock bands , gujjula has produced a cd called " hörbar tolerant " -lrb- audibly tolerant -rrb- .
" lots of the kids just make foolhardy , far-rightist comments without understanding what they say .
we have to convince them that that is nonsense .
we ca n't ostracize them otherwise we 'll lose them to the rightist scene , " the 50-year-old said .
national politicians concerned the increasing confidence of violence-prone rightists has become a source of great discomfort to parliamentary president and social democratic vice-chairman wolfgang thierse .
he has never shied away from confrontation but what he has witnessed at some campaign stops in the east has troubled him .
radicals are speaking more aggressively and skillfully without restraint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse " fortunately lots of people , and i 'd like to point out many young people in our country , have the courage to stand up to the far-right scene .
even to the point that they risk being beaten up or attacked .
it is imperative that we support and encourage them , " thierse said .
in some parts of eastern germany , the radical right is a part of everyday life .
since 2001 , the federal government has supported some 4,000 projects with a total of 154 million euros -lrb- $ 192 millio -rrb- to counteract the ever-increasing acceptance of neo-nazis in mainstream society .
not just a protest vote to ensure the success of these projects , a network of groups and individuals is being established to stand up to the rising trend .
the success of the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in saxon state elections last autumn , for example , ca n't be considered a mere protest or manifestation of youthful angst .
one in five 18-to-25 year olds voted npd then .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc sharp rise in german manufacturing orders orders placed with companies in the german manufacturing sector rose sharply again in july , thanks to strong overseas demand for german-made goods .
the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?
the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc merkel accused of being a copycat angela merkel , a conservative chancellor candidate in the upcoming german elections , was accused on tuesday of copying her closing statement in a tv debate from former us president ronald reagan .
merkel 's short speech at the end of her head-to-head duel with chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday bore a striking resemblance to reagan 's statement at the end of his debate with then president jimmy carter in oct .
1980 .
schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- sdp -rrb- told the online version of der spiegel magazine that merkel 's speechwriters had copied the statement because they were convinced that it had helped swing the election in reagan 's favor .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , who have a clear lead in the polls ahead of the sept .
18 election , acknowledged that she may have borrowed something from reagan 's plea to voters .
" she probably drew inspiration from it , " said cdu spokesman matthias barner .
in the debate in cleveland , ohio , 25 years ago , reagan encouraged his prospective voters to ask themselves a set of questions before going to the polls : " are you better off than you were four years ago ?
is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago ?
is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago ?
and if you answer all of those questions yes , why then , i think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for .
if you do n't agree … then i could suggest another choice that you have . "
angela merkel , in her closing statement , asked her potential voters to engage in a strikingly similar kind of electoral soul-searching : " is our country better off than seven years ago -lrb- when schroeder came to power -rrb- ...
is growth higher ?
is unemployment lower ?
do we have less bureaucracy .
are our pensions and health care better ?
if you can answer yes to all of these questions , then i think you have probably already decided who you will vote for .
but if you have any doubt , if you do not want things to carry on as they are , then you have a choice . "
most observers believed merkel had given a better performance than expected in the debate and that the more assured schroeder failed to make enough impact to swing the election back in his favor . dw-world.de merkel better than expected in debate the polls are showing that chancellor schröder won the tv debate against his challenger , but angela merkel exceeded expectations and won the arguably most important segment of the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc merkel accused of being a copycat angela merkel , a conservative chancellor candidate in the upcoming german elections , was accused on tuesday of copying her closing statement in a tv debate from former us president ronald reagan .
merkel 's short speech at the end of her head-to-head duel with chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday bore a striking resemblance to reagan 's statement at the end of his debate with then president jimmy carter in oct .
1980 .
schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- sdp -rrb- told the online version of der spiegel magazine that merkel 's speechwriters had copied the statement because they were convinced that it had helped swing the election in reagan 's favor .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , who have a clear lead in the polls ahead of the sept .
18 election , acknowledged that she may have borrowed something from reagan 's plea to voters .
" she probably drew inspiration from it , " said cdu spokesman matthias barner .
in the debate in cleveland , ohio , 25 years ago , reagan encouraged his prospective voters to ask themselves a set of questions before going to the polls : " are you better off than you were four years ago ?
is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago ?
is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago ?
and if you answer all of those questions yes , why then , i think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for .
if you do n't agree … then i could suggest another choice that you have . "
angela merkel , in her closing statement , asked her potential voters to engage in a strikingly similar kind of electoral soul-searching : " is our country better off than seven years ago -lrb- when schroeder came to power -rrb- ...
is growth higher ?
is unemployment lower ?
do we have less bureaucracy .
are our pensions and health care better ?
if you can answer yes to all of these questions , then i think you have probably already decided who you will vote for .
but if you have any doubt , if you do not want things to carry on as they are , then you have a choice . "
most observers believed merkel had given a better performance than expected in the debate and that the more assured schroeder failed to make enough impact to swing the election back in his favor . dw-world.de merkel better than expected in debate the polls are showing that chancellor schröder won the tv debate against his challenger , but angela merkel exceeded expectations and won the arguably most important segment of the debate .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .

timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .

but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .
he is also a major republican contributor with the " ranger " status , which is given to those who contribute more than 159,000 euros -lrb- $ 200,000 -rrb- to republican coffers during a campaign cycle . timken replaces former us senator daniel coats , who left berlin in february after three years as ambassador .
since his departure , transatlantic relations , which suffered under german chancellor gerhard schröder 's vocal opposition to the us-led war in iraq , have been gradually improving . that said , relations between the two countries are little more than cordial .
some say wrong man timken has stressed he wants to improve the relationship , but some in germany say he is the wrong choice .

timken recently resigned as chairman of the board of the timken co . , an alloy steel and bearings manufacturer based in canton , ohio , that employs 26,000 people worldwide and rung up sales of 3.59 billion euros last year .
timken served as chairman of the national association of manufacturers , an influential business lobby in washington , and his former company does business in germany .
geissinger added that german bearing manufacturers have paid out millions in protective tariffs , much of which goes into their american competitors ' pockets , competitors such as timken 's former company .
the wto ruled this practice illegal in 2003 in response to a complaint by the eu and other states .
the us has ignored the ruling , spurred on by timken 's former company .
wants to promote business so far , german politicians have declined to comment on the issue .
as has timken himself .

the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?
the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .

" there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .

in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .

the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .

in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .

it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "

tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .
it 's a bit of campaign stop but with constrction schedule for completion in 2010 , angela merkel and germany also stand to benefit from the plans . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc sharp rise in german manufacturing orders orders placed with companies in the german manufacturing sector rose sharply again in july , thanks to strong overseas demand for german-made goods .
the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?
the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .
" we ca n't wait until the next disaster strikes , " he warned . he also emphasized the peace dividend to be reaped from sustainable development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil terminal at baton rouge , new orleans " sustainable development is the best strategy for peace , because it avoids all the known conflicts that usually appear in the wake of ruthless economic expansion , he says .

" time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc sharp rise in german manufacturing orders orders placed with companies in the german manufacturing sector rose sharply again in july , thanks to strong overseas demand for german-made goods .
the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?
the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc sharp rise in german manufacturing orders orders placed with companies in the german manufacturing sector rose sharply again in july , thanks to strong overseas demand for german-made goods .
the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?
the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers .

a berlin court issued a provisional ruling suppressing the publication of gregor gysi 's stasi files .
the leader of the new left party argued its publication would be in breach of his professional secrecy . with less than two weeks to go before the elections , the left party 's star candidate gregor gysi , a fast-talking former lawyer in communist east germany , has won a partial victory at berlin 's administrative court .
judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insisting on the accurate understanding of history : marianne birthler marianne birthler , head of the german authority responsible for the stasi archives , was unwilling to comment on the content of the documents it wanted published , but according to the german weekly der spiegel , they contained information on gysi 's conversations with a former client , east german dissident robert havemann .
gysi justified the request his file remain classified by citing he was bound to professional discretion .
the kohl precedent the erstwhile leader of the former communist party , the pds , gysi has repeatedly been beset by accusations of stasi collaboration over the years - and has always rejected them out of hand .
this was n't the first time he took the matter to a court , nor the first time a court ruled in his favor .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .

the company will avoid outright layoffs , instead trimming its workforce by offering early retirements and part-time positions for older workers . just one month ago , vw chairman bernd pitschetsrieder warned that the future of car-making in germany was at risk if companies like vw could not reduce labor costs which analysts estimate to be at least 20 percent higher than in the rest of the industry . on monday , he told staff in wolfsburg that he was not planning any outright layoffs , but insisted that thousands of jobs had to go . according to german weekly news magazine der spiegel , the company makes some 6 million vehicles a year , but is only able to sell about 5 million of that output . pitschetsrieder said vw had " several thousand " more staff than it needed in germany , in particular at its flagship production plant in wolfsburg . " despite rising sales , the company still has significant over-capacity and will therefore have to increase its efforts to shed staff , " he said . the company now hopes that cutting several thousand jobs at its six german production sites over the next three years will help it regain a competitive footing on the cut-throat international market . commitments honored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wo n't be seen to sit still the world 's fourth-largest carmaker , volkswagen currently employs some 103,000 workers across germany .
its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .

its current collective agreement precludes layoffs until the year 2011 , and the ceo assured employees on monday that the measures would therefore be achieved without breaking commitments made to the workforce in the accord late last year . " it is planned to extend eligibility for early retirement to employees born in 1951 , with a further extension to cover employees born in 1952 if required .
furthermore individual employees will be offered termination packages , " said pitschetsrieder .
the cutbacks apply to employees in all areas , he said , including senior managers . mid-term savings investors welcomed the announcement , with german investment bank dresdner kleinwort wasserstein estimating the cuts could lead to some 560 million euros -lrb- $ 698 million -rrb- in mid-term savings .
shares in volkswagen closed up 3 percent at 43.69 euros on monday , making it the top gainer in the benchmark dax blue chip index .
the shares gathered momentum after impressive sales statistics for its main earnings contributor , audi , as well as an 11 percent rise in new car registrations last month in vw 's german market . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what next for german auto industry ?

the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?

merkel 's short speech at the end of her head-to-head duel with chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday bore a striking resemblance to reagan 's statement at the end of his debate with then president jimmy carter in oct .
1980 .
schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- sdp -rrb- told the online version of der spiegel magazine that merkel 's speechwriters had copied the statement because they were convinced that it had helped swing the election in reagan 's favor .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party , who have a clear lead in the polls ahead of the sept .
18 election , acknowledged that she may have borrowed something from reagan 's plea to voters .
" she probably drew inspiration from it , " said cdu spokesman matthias barner .
in the debate in cleveland , ohio , 25 years ago , reagan encouraged his prospective voters to ask themselves a set of questions before going to the polls : " are you better off than you were four years ago ?
is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago ?
is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago ?
and if you answer all of those questions yes , why then , i think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for .
if you do n't agree … then i could suggest another choice that you have . "
angela merkel , in her closing statement , asked her potential voters to engage in a strikingly similar kind of electoral soul-searching : " is our country better off than seven years ago -lrb- when schroeder came to power -rrb- ...
is growth higher ?
is unemployment lower ?
do we have less bureaucracy .
are our pensions and health care better ?
if you can answer yes to all of these questions , then i think you have probably already decided who you will vote for .
but if you have any doubt , if you do not want things to carry on as they are , then you have a choice . "

is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago ?
is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago ?
and if you answer all of those questions yes , why then , i think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for .
if you do n't agree … then i could suggest another choice that you have . "
angela merkel , in her closing statement , asked her potential voters to engage in a strikingly similar kind of electoral soul-searching : " is our country better off than seven years ago -lrb- when schroeder came to power -rrb- ...
is growth higher ?
is unemployment lower ?
do we have less bureaucracy .
are our pensions and health care better ?
if you can answer yes to all of these questions , then i think you have probably already decided who you will vote for .
but if you have any doubt , if you do not want things to carry on as they are , then you have a choice . "
most observers believed merkel had given a better performance than expected in the debate and that the more assured schroeder failed to make enough impact to swing the election back in his favor . dw-world.de merkel better than expected in debate the polls are showing that chancellor schröder won the tv debate against his challenger , but angela merkel exceeded expectations and won the arguably most important segment of the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc sharp rise in german manufacturing orders orders placed with companies in the german manufacturing sector rose sharply again in july , thanks to strong overseas demand for german-made goods .
the economics and labor ministry calculated that german manufacturing orders rose by 3.7 percent in july from june , extending the 2.3-percent gain seen the previous month .
the reason for the third consecutive monthly increase was an unusually large number of big-ticket orders from outside germany , the ministry said .
while domestic orders slipped by 0.1 percent in july from june , foreign orders jumped by 7.7 percent .
using a two-month comparison to iron out seasonal fluctuations , pan-german orders rose by 5.4 percent in june and july combined from the figure for april and may , the ministry said .
" the economy is increasingly gathering momentum .
alongside a lot of other indicators , manufacturing orders are now also sending a much clearer signal , " said economy minister wolfgang clement .
" upward demand for industrial products is strengthening and the conditions have improved for a pick-up in activity in the coming months , " he said .
commerzbank analysts described the data as a " very positive surprise " that augured well for the economy in the coming months .
nevertheless , given the latest decline in business confidence , as measured by the monthly ifo business climate index , caution was warranted , the analysts warned .
and orders could fall again in august , they added .
ubs economist edward teather said the jump in manufacturing orders in july was " additional proof that the pause in growth in the second quarter had come to an end and the outlook is improving for companies and for investment . " dw-world.de who cares if it 's made in germany ?
the green party 's renate künast was accused of protectionism after her opening statements of the election campaign urged voters to buy german products .
in reality , quality rather than origin matters most to consumers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 voting machines still rare in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike most americans , germans generally write on their ballots several million germans will be using machines to cast their votes on sept .
18 .
but many still eye the method with suspicion .
so far , only one company has managed to comply with germany 's stringent rules . when germans head to the polls on sept .
18 to decide who will be their new chancellor , many voters wo n't place their mark on a ballot paper .
instead , they will be confronted with a primitive keyboard and a little screen not unlike those that were pictured in the news surrounding the chaotic vote count in the 2000 us presidential elections . about five million germans out of almost 62 million eligible voters will be using electronic voting machines -lrb- evms -rrb- : 65 municipalities have decided to use evms this time round and a total of some 2,100 evms will be in operation . " the decision of whether and what type of voting technology to use is entirely that of the towns and local authorities that administer the respective electoral districts , " said a spokesman for the federal elections director .
the only condition is that vote counting complies with the extensive rules on security and verification that are part of the federal election laws . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mechanical voting machines are used in the southwestern state of saarland " these rules comprise over a hundred pages - enough to make most vendors of voting technology turn on their heels and walk out of the door , " said thomas bronder who works for the physikalisch-tech n ische bu n desa n stalt .
the federal agency normally tests one-armed bandits and gambling machinery to ensure they have not been fixed to unduly rip-off soldiers of fortune .
but the agency also tests evms for compliance with the stringent federal rules . so far only one model - the " esd " voting machine produced by a dutch company - has been approved and will be used in the forthcoming elections . o n ly basic machi n es allowed on the surface it looks similar to other voting machines .
it has a simple keyboard consisting of buttons that are embedded in a mask depicting an actual paper ballot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her vote via voting machine in the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt in the 2002 election a person intending to vote for a particular candidate or party simply presses the button located next to her choice .
a small screen then confirms the choice and the ballot is cast and stored electronically on a memory module .
when voting closes at 6 p.m. , every machine prints out the number of votes cast for each party or candidate . what makes this machine very different are the goings-on inside .
and they are anything but high-tech . primitive technology ? " the law demands that voting machines do not contain any technology or functionality beyond the bare minimum needed to fulfill its task of tallying votes , " bronder said . this rules out any pc-based machinery .
evms are also not allowed to run extensive operating systems like windows .
that 's because microsoft keeps the source code under lock and key and so it can not be inspected . the esd machine tested by bronder is more of an electronic counting machine rather than a computer used to count votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronic voting machine in the us " we spent over a year testing the software and frequently got back to the manufacturer demanding changes which they quickly implemented , " he said .
" the data transmitted onto the memory modules is so primitive - you could n't even call it programming - that it 's basically impossible to influence the vote by loading manipulated data onto the memory modules .
it would show up immediately and the voting machine would shut down . " security co n cer n s but what guarantee do bronder and his colleagues have that all evms are the same as the prototype they tested so thoroughly ? " a combination of known checksums tells the local voting administrators about the version of the software running in a particular machine , " bronder said , adding that the checksums would be changed by manipulations . and while this is not a definite guarantee , " why would a company deliberately manipulate and run the risk of ruining their hard earned reputation after getting approval for the strict rules of the german market ? " he said . so , all is well and safe then ?
not quite , said hubertus buchstein , professor of politics at greifswald university in northeastern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voters cast their ballots on new touch screen voting machines in georgia " the machines produce no paper trail , " he said .
this is a problem that had also gained notoriety in the context of the use of evms in the us .
lacking a paper printout confirming the vote , there is no way of proving that the tally stored in the machine really corresponds to the votes cast . the way of the future ? a solution could be that individual paper receipts confirming the vote are shown to the voter before being dumped in a separate ballot box . " these would only need to be counted if controversy arose about the result spewed out by the electronic tally , " buchstein said . also , random checks in a number of voting districts across the country could be used to make sure the stored vote count matches the paper trail .
only in these cases a parallel count of the paper ballot would be necessary , still saving the enormous cost of manually counting paper ballots for the whole electorate . voting via the internet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will people be able to vote via cell phone text messages while on vacation in the future ?
cost reduction is just one motive for towns and local authorities to switch to evms .
in the long term this could be followed by a move towards " online-voting , " buchstein said . " voting from the comfort of your home via internet or cell phone text messaging could help tap into new voter contingents , " he said .
but security remains the overwhelming obstacle to realizing this vision just yet . ranty islam , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

almost finished , the 11,000-square-meter green citadel of madgeburg , which sits kitty-corner from the town ’ s main square , is full of greenery , with trees and gold balls on top .
no two multi-colored columns or doors or even door handles are alike .
for magdeburg officials , this fantastical concoction , the last design of austrian artist and environmentalist friedensreich hundertwasser , is a symbol of the future .
they hope that the 27 million euro -lrb- $ 33.8 million -rrb- project with its 55 apartments , hotel , shops and office space will create jobs and lure tourists to the 1200-year-old economically depressed town .
" it is an important project for us , " said ralf steinmann of the town ’ s tourist office .
" it helps our image as a city to visit . "
struggling to be different after the fall of the berlin wall and german reunification , german politicians swore to help the former east get on its feet .
to date , the government has spent more than 1 trillion euros to renovate buildings , improve roads and upgrade factories .
most of the money for the massive redevelopment projects has been provided by west germans .
bildunterschrift : a model of the buiilding shows the standard motifs of the artist but even as new highways and buildings gleam , unemployment remains twice that of the west : one in five people in the east have no jobs and few prospects of getting one .
younger people are fleeing the smaller cities for new opportunities , often in the west .
and per capita income is about one-third less in the eastern states than in their western counterparts .
madgeburg is no exception .
the city ’ s unemployment rate tops 20 percent .
the city has lost about one-fifth of its current population of 230,000 in the past 15 years .
the per capita income of saxony-anhalt , of which it is the capital , is still 17,500 euros .
berlin , the richest of the six eastern states , has an average income per head of 22,786 euros , germany as a whole , more than 36,000 euros , according to the world bank .
still not all is gloom and doom in the east : leipzig and dresden have managed to attract western investors and are creating jobs : bmw opened a plant this spring in leipzig which brought thousands of new jobs ; a new semiconductor factory in dresden will open next year adding more jobs to the only town in east germany that is gaining in population .
madgeburg hopes to follow their lead .
a one-time jewel dusts itself off it was the largest fortified town in germany through the middle-ages with the oldest gothic cathedral in germany , began by emperor otto i in 955 .
six centuries later , protestant reformer martin luther started preaching there .
despite a long and distinguished history , the town ’ s fortunes began to decline after the end of world war ii .
in 1945 , more than 90 percent of the city ’ s center with its historic buildings were destroyed by allied bombings .
during the communist era , the town became an important center of heavy industry , particularly in heavy machine manufacturing .
but hastily constructed buildings left the once-regal town with the typical eastern flavor of large , gloomy concrete structures with a few run-down gothic and baroque buildings mixed in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city managed to repair some of its historic buildings after reunification , the government began dismantling the factories and renovating and rebuilding the city , tearing down some communist buildings and erecting modern ones as well as renovating the historic structures .
it turned russian dumping ground for artillery and ammunition into a large park , which managed to attract a national garden festival .
it established otto-von-guericke university in 1993 to try to keep its young people home .
now city officials hope that growing biotechnology and machine manufacturing sectors as well as hundertwasser will help push the city forward .
the green citadel the project began after the management of a communist-style apartment building wanted to renovate in the mid-1990s and asked the austrian artist to design the building .
initially there was resistance , of a not-in-my-back-yard variety .
hundreds of residents protested the project because it sits so close to dom platz -lrb- cathedral square -rrb- , with its historic gothic cathedral and baroque buildings .
the citadel would hardly fit in .
but in the end , the city gave the green light .
" i was opposed to the building because it wouldn ’ t be suitable in this location , " said gisela opitz , who lived in the apartment building for years before it was torn down .
" but now i can see how it can be a great thing for our city . "
bildunterschrift : friedensreich hundertwasser wanted his design to lighten up the cityscape of magdeburg it certainly will draw fans of the artist as it has all the features of a classic hundertwasser work : no straight lines -lrb- he believed they were detrimental to the human soul -rrb- ; no symmetry or uniformity -lrb- he wanted people to be challenged with variety or they would stagnate -rrb- ; grass , plants , and trees everywhere throughout the building and on top -lrb- he thought people needed to live closer to nature -rrb- .
hundertwasser died in 2000 at the age of 71 .
town officials say that they have commitments for most of the apartments and commercial space . they add that even though scaffolding still surrounds the incomplete building , 7,000 tourists since may have taken tours of the site and visited the information center .
tourists taking guided tours of the city also jumped 10 percent in the first six months of 2005 .
the project has gotten off to a good start and business experts say that these types of projects can often lead to increased investment and commercial development .
" our clients are interested in such " crazy " projects as the green citadel , " said marcus tolle , managing director of wisa gmbh , an agency that encourages investment in saxony-anhalt .

george w. bush has had his hands full in managing the clean-up but has also taken time to thank those who have helped . the last week has been the most difficult in george w. bush 's presidency since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .
over the past weekend , germany sent two planes loaded with 25 tons of food rations to a us air force base in florida for further distribution to the gulf coast states of louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
another flight carrying 15 tons is scheduled to be delivered on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thw has expertise in portable water purification .
here thw workers after the tsunami in sri lanka " we are so happy that the germans are here .
it 's wonderful , " said john turner who 's in charge of the american disaster prevention association .
in a letter to german chancellor gerhard schröder , president bush wrote that millions of americans were grateful for the assistance from germany .
" it shows the generosity of the german people and government .
it is a testimony to the human spirit as well as to the bonds between our nations , " bush wrote .
technical help desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this couple cries just before their potential rescue from the new orleans convention center beyond food aid , us ambassador to germany , william timken , has issued a " wish list " of technical assistance required by the battered coastal states . it includes items such as generators , emergency shelters , pumps , water purification systems , blankets , medicine , search and rescue teams , logistical experts and vaccination teams .
frank-walter steinmeier , head of the chancellor 's office , said this corresponded with items that germany had offered .
in addition , a medical ship is in the atlantic on its way to egypt for an exercise but could be redirected anytime to the hurricane-stricken region .

this time a natural disaster , hurricane katrina , has wreaked havoc on us soil , quite literally .
efforts to contain the situation have been disastrous , with thousands of citizens of new orleans , mostly blacks , struggling to survive for a week in indescribable conditions while awaiting evacuation .
the international community is responding in offering humanitarian aid to a country that many would consider to be beyond the need .
over the past weekend , germany sent two planes loaded with 25 tons of food rations to a us air force base in florida for further distribution to the gulf coast states of louisiana , mississippi and alabama .

referring to the implications of hurricane katrina in new orleans , he said it was obvious that such disasters could easily lead the world to the brink of a major energy crisis and demanded a quick revision of energy strategies which rely too heavily on crude oil reserves . less dependency in the wake of katrina , the 11-nation oil producers ' group , opec , has said it was pumping a million barrels a day beyond quotas to help keep supplies running . " the current oil shock throughout the world is of major proportions and there is no sign of the oil price rise coming to an end , " said chief economist at the organization for economic cooperation and development jean-philippe cotis on tuesday . klaus töpfer told the daily berliner zeitung that it was time to take action .
" we need to become less dependent on oil , " he insisted , describing the challenge as one of the pressing economic and environmental concerns of the future . escalation all too easy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooded street in new orleans aside from ravaging thousands of lives in new orleans and flattening much of the gulf coast , hurricane katrina also knocked out us refineries and hammered oil platforms , sending petrol prices soaring . " there is unlikely to be a significant drop in the cost of crude oil , " he said , pointing out that demand on the world markets was simply too great to allow for it .
the hurricane had shown how easily disasters can exacerbate problems on the global energy market , he added . if a lesson is to be learnt , he argued , it is that the world needs to invest in renewable energies , more environmentally-friendly transport systems and other forms of fuel . scientists and green politicians have long been predicting the dangers of climate change , he said , and the growing threat of extreme weather makes the issue a political priority .

" time for a sea-change katrina served to bring home a message töpfer has long been trying to convey .
" being dependent on fossil fuels is and will be an increasing burden in the future , " he said earlier this year .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with germany facing a possible change in leadership later this month , töpfer appealed to the country to step up environmental protection efforts .
he dismissed concerns that ecological concern comes at the cost of jobs .
" the environment and economic growth are not mutually exclusive , " he insisted , stressing that greater environmental protection would actually create jobs such as through supporting implementation of sustainable technologies in developing countries . growth alone wo n't lead anywhere the german council for sustainable development was set up in 2001 and serves as an advisory panel of independent environment experts for the german chancellor .
in the past couple of years , council members have urged the government in berlin to invest more resources in renewable energies and low-energy technologies with a view to decreasing the country 's dependence on crude oil reserves . ahead of the 2005 annual meting , council chairman volker hauff sent an open letter to the national parliament , criticising the fact that issues related to sustainable economic growth and environment protection were being given short shrift in the current election campaign . addressing an audience of over 1000 politicians and scientists in berlin , council member marlehn thieme said the current high oil price was , in the final analysis , a result of an unsustainable economic policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.09.2005 ambitious energy project in the pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas could travel from russia to germany - underwater a joint german and russian project is en-route to build one of the most ambitious pipelines ever .
it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here , schröder -lrb- l -rrb- and putin meet in hanover in april .
this week 's visit by putin could possibly be the last while schröder is german chancellor on two separate occassions , german chancellor gerhard schröder , russian president vladimir putin and the companies involved have joined in presenting the pipeline plans to the public .
a third meeting has been moved forward to september 8 so that putin can visit schröder for what might be the last time during his leadership .
it 's a bit of campaign stop but with constrction schedule for completion in 2010 , angela merkel and germany also stand to benefit from the plans . johannes beck -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .
-lrb- march 1 , 2005 -rrb- energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .
to meet them , german oil and gas companies have had to increase production - abroad .

it could make natural gas an attractive alternative to oil and its fluctuating prices . hurricane katrina not only was a disaster to millions of americans and their property , but has created calamity for oil-dependent countries around the world .
oil markets reacted with immediate violence to news that us oil platforms and refineries had suffered major damage .
futures , already up thanks to speculators and rising demand , broke all-time highs in the aftermath of katrina .
in an article with the berliner zeitung , germany 's klaus töpfer , who heads the united nations environmental program -lrb- unep -rrb- said " there will not be a significant drop in oil prices in the future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a clean but dangerous source of electrcity - nuclear power plants are scheduled to be closed in germany germany 's economy , the largest in europe , with its large automobile and chemical industries , however , is dependent on oil .
nuclear energy , a clean but dangerous source of power , is being phased out by the center-left coalition which has made much of promoting alternative energies such as solar and wind power .
even conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel said in the recent televised debate that the country must not rely too much on one energy source .
and in keeping with such statements , a new and unusual natural gas pipeline project is the making as a measure to help reduce germany 's dependence on oil from abroad .
almost 1,200 kilometers under water the yuzhno-russkoye field lies in western siberia and is estimated to hold 1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas .
the easiest , most direct way to connect the virgin field with central and western europe would be to extend current pipelines that run over ground , but the pipeline operators , basf wintershall -lrb- a basf subsidiary -rrb- , e.on ruhrgas and gazprom , have decided to construct an underwater pipeline in the baltic sea .
it will measure nearly 1,200 kilometer -lrb- 744 miles -rrb- and stretch from the russian port of wyborg to greifswald in northeastern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurrican katrina laid waste to or dismantled hundreds of oil platforms from their moorings in the gulf of mexico , sending oil prices skyrocketing " the reasons for building an underwater pipeline are to avoid having a line go through third countries , " said roland götz , russian expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin .
" they do n't want to go through belarus and poland or ukraine and slovakia .
they want to make a direct connection between producer and recipient , russian and germany , so that they can save transit fees and to avoid the theoretical possibility that a third country could cut off service . "
the total cost of the venture is estimated at 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3 bill . -rrb- , which is twice as much as if current pipelines were extended , but that is not enough to put the involved parties off .
" the companies involved are hoping to gain some kind of advantage out of the deal that is n't so obvious , " noted götz .
" the german companies would like to do business with gazprom .
gazprom might be trying to use this as a threat against countries like belarus and ukraine . "
warsaw unhappy but project moving on one of the odd men out in the pipeline deal , poland , feels as if it is being given the runaround .
based on the sensitive past between poland , russia and germany , warsaw is angry but götz believes this anger is not based on fact , pointing out that the pipeline wo n't change the current energy business between russia and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.09.2005 new us envoy tries to mend ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no diplomatic experience but good intentions the new us ambassador to germany is trying to strengthen transatlantic relations .
but some grumble that he is a key beneficiary of anti-trade tariffs that have hurt german business and not the right man for the job . arriving in germany in late august , new us ambassador william r. timken jr. stressed what he said were germany and the us ' mutual priorities to promote freedom while downplaying differences over the iraq war .
" our two countries ' shared values and efforts to advance freedom and prosperity have served as beacons of hope for many around the world , " he told reporters .
" as i speak , americans and germans are working side by side to promote stability in afghanistan , sustainable development in africa and an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict . "
timken , 66 , who lacks any diplomatic experience , served as finance co-chairman for bush 's 2004 presidential campaign in ohio , the state that gave bush his margin of victory .

judges approved his application for a temporary injunction against publication of the file compiled on him by the east german secret police , or stasi .
a final decision will be made after the elections , once the court has examined further evidence .

18 .
but many still eye the method with suspicion .
so far , only one company has managed to comply with germany 's stringent rules . when germans head to the polls on sept .
18 to decide who will be their new chancellor , many voters wo n't place their mark on a ballot paper .
instead , they will be confronted with a primitive keyboard and a little screen not unlike those that were pictured in the news surrounding the chaotic vote count in the 2000 us presidential elections . about five million germans out of almost 62 million eligible voters will be using electronic voting machines -lrb- evms -rrb- : 65 municipalities have decided to use evms this time round and a total of some 2,100 evms will be in operation .

following three hours of talks with chinese premier wen jiabo , he said people wanted to know " what kind of country they are dealing with " .
mr blair says britain 's trade with china should reach £ 21.7bn by 2010 .
the target was set as airbus announced orders from china for 10 a330 aircraft worth £ 815m .
' enormous challenges ' speaking after the talks , mr blair said he had told his chinese counterpart that people did not " resent " china .
mr blair told reporters : " but they have got a question mark because they see this enormous economic power and they ask ' will this developing economy be matched by political development and development in the field of human rights as well ? '
there was no desire to escape this topic - there was a genuine sense of engagement tony blair " his answer to me was that china faced enormous challenges because you have got a relatively wealthy party of china , but many , many poor people .
" their economic development has a long way to go but they recognise that political development can accompany that but we shall have to see how that goes . "
mr blair , who was attending a cultural reception in the courtyard of a 16th century former royal palace , said : " it 's important , just as we understand china 's need urgently to develop its economy , at the same time china has to understand that people see a new china emerging and want to know what kind of country they are dealing with .
" i think there 's a genuine understanding of that concern on the chinese side . "
opportunity knocks ?
mr blair added : " the whole basis of the discussion i have had in a country that 's developing very fast - it 's going to be the second largest economy in the world very shortly - that there 's an unstoppable momentum there towards greater political freedom , progress on human rights and those other issues , and i think there 's an understanding that that should happen .
" whether it does happen or not , time will tell . "
mr blair said that unlike his previous two visits to china " there was no desire to escape this topic - there was a genuine sense of engagement " .
he said the question that needed to be answered by china and the rest of the world was " do people feel threatened by china or do they see an opportunity " .

following three hours of talks with chinese premier wen jiabo , he said people wanted to know " what kind of country they are dealing with " .
mr blair says britain 's trade with china should reach £ 21.7bn by 2010 .
the target was set as airbus announced orders from china for 10 a330 aircraft worth £ 815m .
' enormous challenges ' speaking after the talks , mr blair said he had told his chinese counterpart that people did not " resent " china .
mr blair told reporters : " but they have got a question mark because they see this enormous economic power and they ask ' will this developing economy be matched by political development and development in the field of human rights as well ? '

mr blair said that unlike his previous two visits to china " there was no desire to escape this topic - there was a genuine sense of engagement " .

this has been a terrible year to be a muslim .
but , revolted by what is being perpetrated in the name of islam , the muslim world is bringing a whole range of new debates to the fore .
for decades the core debate in the muslim world was about establishing an ideological " islamic state " and returning to the sharia , the historical body of islamic law .
this debate , often led by so-called " islamic movements " , produced a narrow , intolerant , obscurantist , illiberal , brutal and confrontational interpretation of islam .
it is this interpretation that gave rise to what we now know as " islamic fundamentalism " .
but the fixed simplistics of fundamentalists never were the whole of the debate - even though the fundamentalists shout the loudest and dominate the globe through violent expression .
sharia debate now , fundamentalism is being challenged by emerging and alternative visions of islam , each taking shape in different ways in different countries .
pakistan was founded as the first modern islamic state .
but it was only in 1978 under the military regime of general zia ul haq that sharia was made the law of the land .
battle for islam ziauddin sardar presents a 90-minute documentary monday , 5 september , 2005 bbc two , 2100 bst what followed was a series of cases where the implementation of the law acquired a notorious reputation for practical injustice , especially towards women .
and it is women who are really standing up to this law .
the essence of the argument against the sharia is much more than the fact that its interpretation and application is illiberal and contrary to contemporary ideas of human rights .
the fundamentalist position is that the koran is the source of all legislation in islam and therefore the sharia is an immutable body of sacred law .
it is this concept itself that is now being challenged .
sharia , it is being widely argued , is not divine but a " jurists ' law " , that was formulated and socially constructed during the early phase of islamic history .
it can be changed , modified and reformulated - in its entirety .
thus the sharia , as an inherited body of rulings and precedent , is being reclaimed in pakistan .
muslim scholars are demanding the same right as their forebears to investigate the sources for alternative interpretations , new ways of framing and operating precepts and law .
activists ' agenda we can see this activism not just in pakistan but also in morocco .
in morocco an entirely recast family law aspect of sharia has been produced by islamic scholars .
it was promulgated by the king in response to widespread public demonstrations by women and , when published , became an instant best-seller .
while it has its opponents , including women , its impeccable islamic intellectual credentials - advancing the case for gender equality , poverty eradication , economic advancement and the development of free expression through civil society - are now the agenda of debate .
the irony is that neither pakistan nor morocco are democracies : one a thinly veiled military regime , the other a near-absolute monarchy .
but the activist proponents of this alternative interpretation of islam are clear that it can never be fully realised without democracy ; indeed that democracy is an essential hallmark of a genuine islamic society .
separation from state indonesia has the world 's largest muslim population .
eight years ago , it threw off 30 years of dictatorship backed by the military .
democracy has led to a great outpouring of new thinking . "
the reality of the muslim world is its immense diversity " ziauddin sardar established organisations such as mohammadiyah and new civic society organisations such as the liberal islam network - which have followings in the tens of millions - are revising the conventional views of islam and the state .
in seeking an interpretation of islam that is both authentic and moderate , liberal , tolerant , open and democratic , they stress the importance of separation between religion and state .
and thus they come to a vision of modernity for muslims that is rooted in , and inspired by , islam , yet does not lay claim to being an infallible expression of religion and therefore closed to debate .
it is these agents of civil society that are setting the pace of change .
diverse solutions the demands they make on governments are producing a response .
but it is no longer a case of seeking one solution .
there is a diversity of responses according to the particular circumstances of different countries , with different histories and different experiences of modernising and modernity .
countries visited for the documentary pakistan indonesia malaysia morocco turkey find out more with our clickable map the extremists have one all-embracing , all-constraining ideology .
but the reality of the muslim world is its immense diversity .
the new ideas battling for the soul of islam have a clear set of common principles but they are varied and must be heard in their own context and place .
a journey around the populous periphery of the muslim world clearly demonstrates that the extremists are not only a minority but that the fossilised traditionalism from which they derive their legitimacy is also on the retreat .
there is a new air of optimism and confidence in many places that an islam that is moderate , tolerant and democratic not only should - but will - actually be the future .
this new spirit , and the new ideas it is producing , is not tentative .
but it would be too soon to assert that the ideas are carrying all before them and have secured their dominance .
it is , however , beyond question that to understand the changes taking place in the muslim world , and appreciate how islam is being reformed , one has to listen to these voices from the edge .
battle for islam , presented by ziauddin sardar , was broadcast on bbc two at 2100 bst on monday , 5 september , 2005 .

pakistani-born sardar discussed " enlightened moderation " with president pervez musharraf this has been a terrible year to be a muslim .
but , revolted by what is being perpetrated in the name of islam , the muslim world is bringing a whole range of new debates to the fore .
for decades the core debate in the muslim world was about establishing an ideological " islamic state " and returning to the sharia , the historical body of islamic law .
this debate , often led by so-called " islamic movements " , produced a narrow , intolerant , obscurantist , illiberal , brutal and confrontational interpretation of islam .
it is this interpretation that gave rise to what we now know as " islamic fundamentalism " .
but the fixed simplistics of fundamentalists never were the whole of the debate - even though the fundamentalists shout the loudest and dominate the globe through violent expression .
sharia debate now , fundamentalism is being challenged by emerging and alternative visions of islam , each taking shape in different ways in different countries .
pakistan was founded as the first modern islamic state .
but it was only in 1978 under the military regime of general zia ul haq that sharia was made the law of the land .
battle for islam ziauddin sardar presents a 90-minute documentary monday , 5 september , 2005 bbc two , 2100 bst what followed was a series of cases where the implementation of the law acquired a notorious reputation for practical injustice , especially towards women .
and it is women who are really standing up to this law .
the essence of the argument against the sharia is much more than the fact that its interpretation and application is illiberal and contrary to contemporary ideas of human rights .
the fundamentalist position is that the koran is the source of all legislation in islam and therefore the sharia is an immutable body of sacred law .
it is this concept itself that is now being challenged .
sharia , it is being widely argued , is not divine but a " jurists ' law " , that was formulated and socially constructed during the early phase of islamic history .
it can be changed , modified and reformulated - in its entirety .
thus the sharia , as an inherited body of rulings and precedent , is being reclaimed in pakistan .
muslim scholars are demanding the same right as their forebears to investigate the sources for alternative interpretations , new ways of framing and operating precepts and law .
activists ' agenda we can see this activism not just in pakistan but also in morocco .

pakistani-born sardar discussed " enlightened moderation " with president pervez musharraf this has been a terrible year to be a muslim .
but , revolted by what is being perpetrated in the name of islam , the muslim world is bringing a whole range of new debates to the fore .
for decades the core debate in the muslim world was about establishing an ideological " islamic state " and returning to the sharia , the historical body of islamic law .
this debate , often led by so-called " islamic movements " , produced a narrow , intolerant , obscurantist , illiberal , brutal and confrontational interpretation of islam .
it is this interpretation that gave rise to what we now know as " islamic fundamentalism " .
but the fixed simplistics of fundamentalists never were the whole of the debate - even though the fundamentalists shout the loudest and dominate the globe through violent expression .
sharia debate now , fundamentalism is being challenged by emerging and alternative visions of islam , each taking shape in different ways in different countries .
pakistan was founded as the first modern islamic state .
but it was only in 1978 under the military regime of general zia ul haq that sharia was made the law of the land .
battle for islam ziauddin sardar presents a 90-minute documentary monday , 5 september , 2005 bbc two , 2100 bst what followed was a series of cases where the implementation of the law acquired a notorious reputation for practical injustice , especially towards women .
and it is women who are really standing up to this law .
the essence of the argument against the sharia is much more than the fact that its interpretation and application is illiberal and contrary to contemporary ideas of human rights .
the fundamentalist position is that the koran is the source of all legislation in islam and therefore the sharia is an immutable body of sacred law .
it is this concept itself that is now being challenged .
sharia , it is being widely argued , is not divine but a " jurists ' law " , that was formulated and socially constructed during the early phase of islamic history .
it can be changed , modified and reformulated - in its entirety .
thus the sharia , as an inherited body of rulings and precedent , is being reclaimed in pakistan .
muslim scholars are demanding the same right as their forebears to investigate the sources for alternative interpretations , new ways of framing and operating precepts and law .
activists ' agenda we can see this activism not just in pakistan but also in morocco .
in morocco an entirely recast family law aspect of sharia has been produced by islamic scholars .
it was promulgated by the king in response to widespread public demonstrations by women and , when published , became an instant best-seller .
what might the younger generation bring to islam ?
while it has its opponents , including women , its impeccable islamic intellectual credentials - advancing the case for gender equality , poverty eradication , economic advancement and the development of free expression through civil society - are now the agenda of debate .
the irony is that neither pakistan nor morocco are democracies : one a thinly veiled military regime , the other a near-absolute monarchy .
but the activist proponents of this alternative interpretation of islam are clear that it can never be fully realised without democracy ; indeed that democracy is an essential hallmark of a genuine islamic society .
separation from state indonesia has the world 's largest muslim population .

democracy has led to a great outpouring of new thinking .

" when it comes to bedtime i 'm tired and try to make myself go to sleep , but i ca n't , my mind is racing and my thoughts whirling . "
these are the words of john and anne and what they are describing are the all too familiar symptoms of stress .
stress is a constant theme in our lives .
it is the second biggest cause of time off work and is estimated to cost the country £ 13bn a year .
it 's a wonderful adaptation should you come across a bear - but too much of a good thing and you 're in trouble professor robert sapolsky we clearly are not coping well with it , but how sick is it making us ?
we all differ in what hits our own particular stress buttons - deadlines at work , being late , traffic jams - or what does it for me , computer rage .
this differing response makes stress difficult to research .
simulating stress but researchers at a unique stress research facility in the integrative neuroscience and endocrinology at the university of bristol have found a way .
an individual 's blood pressure and heartbeat are recorded before and after they breathe an air mix containing 35 % carbon dioxide for four seconds .
normal air contains just 0.03 % of this gas .
this prompts an acute - and automatic - physiological stress response .
and it 's what i found myself doing for the programme .
at the start , my heartbeat was 54 per minute and my blood pressure a healthy 110/65 .
i knew i was safe , but my body disagreed violently - it thought i was being suffocated .
my blood pressure shot through the roof - to 193/65 .
i felt sick and panic stricken .
it was horrible .
but a couple of minutes afterwards , i was back to normal again .
the initial but dramatic rise is normal .
in those who are chronically stressed , the return to normality is much slower .
" their body is able to turn their acute stress response on , but is not as good at switching it off again , " said professor stafford lightman , director of the bristol unit .
as professor simon wessely , of king 's college hospital says , an acute stress response is actually good news : " it allows you to react to an emergency . "
a bear jumping out at you in the street will prompt a flood of the stress hormones , first adrenaline and then cortisol , preparing you for fight , flight or fright .
robert sapolsky , professor of biological sciences at stanford university and the world 's leading stress researcher , summarised it like this .
" your body is turning off all the long term building and repair projects .
it 's do it tonight , if there is a tonight ' .
" so blood pressure soars , more body fuel in the form of glucose is made available , the immune system is enhanced .
" it 's a wonderful adaptation should you come across a bear .
but too much of a good thing and you 're in trouble . "
long-term impact constant high levels of cortisol take your body 's eye off the ball .
repairs are n't done , patrols for invaders are n't sent out , you tire more easily , you can become depressed and reproduction gets downgraded .
it 's a profound privilege to die from stress related diseases professor robert sapolsky high bloodstream levels of glucose and fatty acids and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes .
the immune system is suppressed .
work at bristol clearly demonstrates the latter in the much reduced response of older carers of those with alzheimers to flu vaccines , compared to people of the same age not under so much stress .
but why are some people more affected by stress than others ?
professor stafford lightman , director of the bristol centre , said : " there are three main reasons .
" our genes , our experiences in early life and what 's happened to us recently . "
we all understand the latter .
bereavement , losing a job , divorce , caring for someone who is sick are highly stressful life events .
stress controls of great scientific interest are our stress ' thermostats ' which switch our response on , and , most importantly , off again .
professor lightman said : " understanding pathways in dysfunctional stress responses means that you can rationally design therapies to block their effect . "
the settings for our thermostats are partly inherited - but scientists also know that they can be reset during childhood .
work with animals suggests that emotional deprivation in early life causes heightened stress responses as adult animals .
it 's highly likely this is the case for people too .
re-setting the stress thermostat in childhood is an important adaptation - it equips a child born into a difficult world to be constantly on the alert .
but this alertness comes with a long term price : heart disease , diabetes , obesity and depression .
there are also behavioural implications of raised stress hormones , such as greater levels of violence and risk taking .
since we now have epidemic levels of cardiovascular disease and diabetes , does this indicate that we live in a much more stressful world ?
the answer is a resounding no .
if anything we live much less stressful lives than our forbears .
professor sapolsky said : " it 's a profound privilege to die from stress related diseases .
" it is the elimination of other causes of death such as infectious disease which is responsible for bringing lifestyle diseases to the fore - and these are exquisitely sensitive to stress . "
it makes finding a way to treat stress in those who are vulnerable to it ever more important .
stressed out will be broadcast on radio 4 at 2100bst on wednesday 7 september .
you can also listen online for 7 days after that at radio 4 's listen again page .

there are also behavioural implications of raised stress hormones , such as greater levels of violence and risk taking .
since we now have epidemic levels of cardiovascular disease and diabetes , does this indicate that we live in a much more stressful world ?
the answer is a resounding no .
if anything we live much less stressful lives than our forbears .
professor sapolsky said : " it 's a profound privilege to die from stress related diseases .
" it is the elimination of other causes of death such as infectious disease which is responsible for bringing lifestyle diseases to the fore - and these are exquisitely sensitive to stress . "
it makes finding a way to treat stress in those who are vulnerable to it ever more important .
stressed out will be broadcast on radio 4 at 2100bst on wednesday 7 september .
you can also listen online for 7 days after that at radio 4 's listen again page .

" my muscles get more and more tense , my heart 's getting faster and faster , there 's a pain in my chest - i 'm a gibbering wreck ' .
" when it comes to bedtime i 'm tired and try to make myself go to sleep , but i ca n't , my mind is racing and my thoughts whirling . "
these are the words of john and anne and what they are describing are the all too familiar symptoms of stress .
stress is a constant theme in our lives .
it is the second biggest cause of time off work and is estimated to cost the country £ 13bn a year .
it 's a wonderful adaptation should you come across a bear - but too much of a good thing and you 're in trouble professor robert sapolsky we clearly are not coping well with it , but how sick is it making us ?
we all differ in what hits our own particular stress buttons - deadlines at work , being late , traffic jams - or what does it for me , computer rage .
this differing response makes stress difficult to research .
simulating stress but researchers at a unique stress research facility in the integrative neuroscience and endocrinology at the university of bristol have found a way .
an individual 's blood pressure and heartbeat are recorded before and after they breathe an air mix containing 35 % carbon dioxide for four seconds .
normal air contains just 0.03 % of this gas .
this prompts an acute - and automatic - physiological stress response .
and it 's what i found myself doing for the programme .
at the start , my heartbeat was 54 per minute and my blood pressure a healthy 110/65 .
i knew i was safe , but my body disagreed violently - it thought i was being suffocated .
my blood pressure shot through the roof - to 193/65 .
i felt sick and panic stricken .
it was horrible .
but a couple of minutes afterwards , i was back to normal again .
the initial but dramatic rise is normal .
in those who are chronically stressed , the return to normality is much slower .
" their body is able to turn their acute stress response on , but is not as good at switching it off again , " said professor stafford lightman , director of the bristol unit .
as professor simon wessely , of king 's college hospital says , an acute stress response is actually good news : " it allows you to react to an emergency . "
a bear jumping out at you in the street will prompt a flood of the stress hormones , first adrenaline and then cortisol , preparing you for fight , flight or fright .
robert sapolsky , professor of biological sciences at stanford university and the world 's leading stress researcher , summarised it like this .
" your body is turning off all the long term building and repair projects .
it 's do it tonight , if there is a tonight ' .
" so blood pressure soars , more body fuel in the form of glucose is made available , the immune system is enhanced .
" it 's a wonderful adaptation should you come across a bear .
but too much of a good thing and you 're in trouble . "
long-term impact constant high levels of cortisol take your body 's eye off the ball .
repairs are n't done , patrols for invaders are n't sent out , you tire more easily , you can become depressed and reproduction gets downgraded .
it 's a profound privilege to die from stress related diseases professor robert sapolsky high bloodstream levels of glucose and fatty acids and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes .
the immune system is suppressed .
work at bristol clearly demonstrates the latter in the much reduced response of older carers of those with alzheimers to flu vaccines , compared to people of the same age not under so much stress .
but why are some people more affected by stress than others ?
professor stafford lightman , director of the bristol centre , said : " there are three main reasons .
" our genes , our experiences in early life and what 's happened to us recently . "
we all understand the latter .
bereavement , losing a job , divorce , caring for someone who is sick are highly stressful life events .
stress controls of great scientific interest are our stress ' thermostats ' which switch our response on , and , most importantly , off again .
professor lightman said : " understanding pathways in dysfunctional stress responses means that you can rationally design therapies to block their effect . "
the settings for our thermostats are partly inherited - but scientists also know that they can be reset during childhood .
work with animals suggests that emotional deprivation in early life causes heightened stress responses as adult animals .
it 's highly likely this is the case for people too .
re-setting the stress thermostat in childhood is an important adaptation - it equips a child born into a difficult world to be constantly on the alert .
but this alertness comes with a long term price : heart disease , diabetes , obesity and depression .

the settings for our thermostats are partly inherited - but scientists also know that they can be reset during childhood .
work with animals suggests that emotional deprivation in early life causes heightened stress responses as adult animals .
it 's highly likely this is the case for people too .
re-setting the stress thermostat in childhood is an important adaptation - it equips a child born into a difficult world to be constantly on the alert .
but this alertness comes with a long term price : heart disease , diabetes , obesity and depression .
there are also behavioural implications of raised stress hormones , such as greater levels of violence and risk taking .
since we now have epidemic levels of cardiovascular disease and diabetes , does this indicate that we live in a much more stressful world ?
the answer is a resounding no .
if anything we live much less stressful lives than our forbears .
professor sapolsky said : " it 's a profound privilege to die from stress related diseases .
" it is the elimination of other causes of death such as infectious disease which is responsible for bringing lifestyle diseases to the fore - and these are exquisitely sensitive to stress . "
it makes finding a way to treat stress in those who are vulnerable to it ever more important .
stressed out will be broadcast on radio 4 at 2100bst on wednesday 7 september .
you can also listen online for 7 days after that at radio 4 's listen again page .

" my muscles get more and more tense , my heart 's getting faster and faster , there 's a pain in my chest - i 'm a gibbering wreck ' .
" when it comes to bedtime i 'm tired and try to make myself go to sleep , but i ca n't , my mind is racing and my thoughts whirling . "
these are the words of john and anne and what they are describing are the all too familiar symptoms of stress .
stress is a constant theme in our lives .
it is the second biggest cause of time off work and is estimated to cost the country £ 13bn a year . "
it 's a wonderful adaptation should you come across a bear - but too much of a good thing and you 're in trouble " professor robert sapolsky we clearly are not coping well with it , but how sick is it making us ?
we all differ in what hits our own particular stress buttons - deadlines at work , being late , traffic jams - or what does it for me , computer rage .
this differing response makes stress difficult to research .
simulating stress but researchers at a unique stress research facility in the integrative neuroscience and endocrinology at the university of bristol have found a way .
an individual 's blood pressure and heartbeat are recorded before and after they breathe an air mix containing 35 % carbon dioxide for four seconds .
normal air contains just 0.03 % of this gas .
this prompts an acute - and automatic - physiological stress response .
and it 's what i found myself doing for the programme .
at the start , my heartbeat was 54 per minute and my blood pressure a healthy 110/65 .
i knew i was safe , but my body disagreed violently - it thought i was being suffocated .
my blood pressure shot through the roof - to 193/65 .
i felt sick and panic stricken .
it was horrible .
but a couple of minutes afterwards , i was back to normal again .
the initial but dramatic rise is normal .
in those who are chronically stressed , the return to normality is much slower .
" their body is able to turn their acute stress response on , but is not as good at switching it off again , " said professor stafford lightman , director of the bristol unit .
as professor simon wessely , of king 's college hospital says , an acute stress response is actually good news : " it allows you to react to an emergency . "
a bear jumping out at you in the street will prompt a flood of the stress hormones , first adrenaline and then cortisol , preparing you for fight , flight or fright .
robert sapolsky , professor of biological sciences at stanford university and the world 's leading stress researcher , summarised it like this .
" your body is turning off all the long term building and repair projects .
it 's do it tonight , if there is a tonight ' .
" so blood pressure soars , more body fuel in the form of glucose is made available , the immune system is enhanced .
" it 's a wonderful adaptation should you come across a bear .
but too much of a good thing and you 're in trouble . "
long-term impact constant high levels of cortisol take your body 's eye off the ball .
repairs are n't done , patrols for invaders are n't sent out , you tire more easily , you can become depressed and reproduction gets downgraded . "
it 's a profound privilege to die from stress related diseases " professor robert sapolsky high bloodstream levels of glucose and fatty acids and high blood pressure increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes .
the immune system is suppressed .
work at bristol clearly demonstrates the latter in the much reduced response of older carers of those with alzheimers to flu vaccines , compared to people of the same age not under so much stress .
but why are some people more affected by stress than others ?
professor stafford lightman , director of the bristol centre , said : " there are three main reasons .
" our genes , our experiences in early life and what 's happened to us recently . "
we all understand the latter .
bereavement , losing a job , divorce , caring for someone who is sick are highly stressful life events .
stress controls of great scientific interest are our stress ' thermostats ' which switch our response on , and , most importantly , off again .
professor lightman said : " understanding pathways in dysfunctional stress responses means that you can rationally design therapies to block their effect . "
the settings for our thermostats are partly inherited - but scientists also know that they can be reset during childhood .
work with animals suggests that emotional deprivation in early life causes heightened stress responses as adult animals .
it 's highly likely this is the case for people too .
re-setting the stress thermostat in childhood is an important adaptation - it equips a child born into a difficult world to be constantly on the alert .
but this alertness comes with a long term price : heart disease , diabetes , obesity and depression .
there are also behavioural implications of raised stress hormones , such as greater levels of violence and risk taking .

national water inspectors are looking at the outbreak of worm-like creatures and will take action if necessary .
sue pennison , from the drinking water inspectorate , said the larvae - which came from a plant in melbourne - are not harmful but can concern consumers .
the larvae , about 4mm -lrb- 0.16in -rrb- long , have been found in at least 10 homes .
pipes scoured " under the water act , we can prosecute for water that is unfit for consumption , including water that is aesthetically unpleasing , " she said .
david wickens , quality and environmental manager at severn trent , said an improvement should be seen right away and the larvae should be eliminated by the weekend .
" this programme should be completed by the weekend - and scouring of the pipes will continue until the mains are cleared . "
anyone with a complaint can contact water voice , a consumer group or severn trent 's customer call centre .

telstra executives have blamed tighter regulation for an expected slide in profits , triggering a near 6 % slide in its stock price over two days .
that has angered prime minister john howard , who is pushing a long planned privatisation through parliament .
chief executive sol trujillo 's comments were " disgraceful " , he said .
" i think it is the obligation of senior executives at telstra to talk up the company 's interests , not talk them down . "
impending sell-off mr howard 's comments came at a meeting of government mps and senators to discuss the 30bn australian dollar -lrb- $ 23bn ; £ 12.5bn -rrb- sale of the government 's 51 % stake in telstra .
the plan was stalled for several years in the face of an opposition majority in the senate .

it is this issue that helped spur increasingly outspoken complaints from mr trujillo , a us telecoms veteran , and his largely us-sourced team .
the government wants to split the company 's monopoly phone network away from its retail arm to enhance competition , but to leave intact service obligations , which telstra says could cost the firm a $ 850m this year .
overall , slow growth in the mobile market and a faster than expected slide in fixed-line revenues mean profits will fall 10 % this year , mr trujillo said on monday .
a week earlier , his head of regulatory and policy issues said he would not advise his own mother to buy telstra shares - a comment that drew trenchant criticism from liberal party legislators .

the vote , which came after a marathon session , should strengthen mrs arroyo 's bid to ride out accusations of corruption and electoral fraud .
but opposition leaders have vowed to keep up their campaign , using the courts and popular rallies .
several thousand activists gathered on tuesday to march to congress , where security had been stepped up .
mrs arroyo has denied any wrongdoing but admitted to a " lapse in judgement " in phoning an election officer during the 2004 presidential poll .
deputies in the lower house voted on whether to endorse a committee report which last week recommended throwing out the claims against the president .
arroyo 's problems accused of using position to influence 2004 poll husband accused of influence-peddling and taking bribes son and brother-in-law also implicated family denies all allegations the opposition needed 79 votes to reject the report 's findings , but managed to secure only 51 .
" we may have lost , we may have not gotten the 79 signatures , this does not mean that gloria macapagal arroyo has won , " lower house opposition leader francis escudero said .
anti-arroyo groups gathered in manila on tuesday , angry at the prospect of the president escaping impeachment charges .
former president cory aquino , who led the " people power " movement that ousted ferdinand marcos , joined the march .
mrs aquino , who is still highly respected in the philippines , has been critical of mrs arroyo but had not before taken to the streets .
although such protests have been frequent , even the largest anti-arroyo rally has fallen far short of the hundreds of thousands that joined the uprisings that overthrew ferdinand marcos in 1986 and joseph estrada in 2001 .

screen international 's sandy george said : " the positive reaction of the several hundred strong audience - the majority of them young kids - at the premiere suggests that the film will perform strongly worldwide . "
park has spent five years working on his popular characters ' big-screen debut and admitted he finds it hard to move on .
" you have to kind of let it go , " he said .
" there has to be some cut-off point for sanity , really . "

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

incumbent president hosni mubarak - who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office - says the poll will be free and fair .
however some opposition parties are boycotting the vote , saying the dominance of mr mubarak 's national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- will help him retain power .
do you think these elections signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt ?
are you an egyptian planning to vote in the election ?
what are the most important issues for you ?
send us your comments and experiences .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments the following comments reflect the balance of views received : the egyptian people are very privileged to have such a wise effective leader as hosni mubarak .
i 'd have him instead of blair anyday .
mike carus , birmingham , england i guess mubarak will win this time , because most people do n't trust the other candidates .
people want things to be settled and do n't want anything to affect their way of living negatively .
rashed , dubai , uae in light of the pressures exerted on mubarak from the us to " democratise " he and his party have put on a very well orchestrated charade to convince everyone that change is coming though very little has actually changed .
it is a perfect set up to pass the rule on to mubarak junior under the pretext of ' democracy ' .
add to that the false propaganda played over the years that it is either mubarak or chaos and you have perfect setup for stagnation .
ehab nabil , cairo , egypt the elections in egypt are a bit of a sham , but a small step in the right direction .
peter reed , dexter , me , us i am disgusted to see mubarak 's face in the streets or whenever i open a newspaper .
the level of corruption in this country is shameful , companies take out full page adverts in support of mubarak when our nation 's people are out of work and starving .
everybody in egypt knows he will win by a vast majority and nothing will have changed , anyone thinking otherwise is in another world .
for 24 years to get anywhere in egyptian society you have to donate a certain amount to mubarak 's party or show support or do something that just tightens his grip on the country .
mubarak will not let anyone take power from him until he hands over to his son gamal on his death bed and in doing so will condemn our country to and even worse situation .
tarek soliman , zamalek , cairo hosni mubarak did the best job he could and i hope he gets elected again , and what is wrong with gamal mubarak ?
i hope he runs as well and i hope he wins one day , there is nothing wrong with successful people to the country .
ihab , tn , us this is the first time another egyptian will have chance other than hosni mubarak to become president .
in this context it is a big change towards democracy .
but i doubt whether egypt is competent enough to accept the great system of democracy .
perhaps it will give a chance to radical mullahs who will lead this ancient country into a taleban style state .
edwin zacharia , india give me a decent standard of living , i 'll give you my vote .
simple as that !
change is the essence of life .
i 've started to doubt the word ' democracy ' exists at all .
we need to breathe fresh air , eat healthy food , be educated seriously and efficiently , work and be able to provide for our living proudly .
is that too much to ask for ?
i wonder ...
hala , cairo , egypt i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years mohamed , melbourne , australia i 'm an australian of egyptian background and i personally see mubarak as the leader to take egypt for the next six years .
first of all , we do n't know the other candidates that much and mubarak is the man that can keep egypt stable and improve its economy .
we 'll wait and see but for the others , maybe in another six years you 'll get your chance .
mohamed , melbourne , australia although mubarak is likely to win even in a free and fair election , the government and ruling party insist on rigging the elections with biased media , keeping the voters lists inconsistent and even arresting opposition figures .
hatem nawar , giza , egypt i ca n't imagine that egypt will be ruled by the same regime again .
there are hundreds of qualified persons in egypt of whom one deserves to be the next president .
magda hamid hussein taher , khartoum , sudan mubarak is a must .
despite the country 's economy , which has fallen down , he is giving egypt prestige in the world , especially in front of america .
tarek , london , uk this is not a question of one man to be elected .
how can we hope for democracy if we have a president with unlimited power who heads the one party that controls all the institutions ?
the coming elections are in fact a lethal blow to any hope of democracy in egypt as it will give a corrupt regime the legitimacy it lacked for nearly 53 years when any hope of democratic practice was ended by the july revolution .
hatem medhat , cairo , egypt i think mubarak is the best candidate for the presidency .
his program is the most organized and most comprehensive , except his ignoring the widespread corruption .
i 'll vote for him on wednesday .
ismail el-naggar , cairo , egypt to all egyptians , go out and vote no matter what .
mubarak will be gone sooner or later but never give up your right to vote ; the more people go to the polls the less likely the riggers will dare to bring their own cooked-up boxes to the poll stations .
go out and vote .
make change happen .
show the world that there is still pulse in you .
let democracy reign .
ashraf , california , usa the fact that mubarak and his regime are being subject to criticism by opposition parties and highlighted in the media is in itself a change in the egyptian political life .
mubarak 's work has had positive and negative fruits .
the former are shown in national security , infrastructure and fight against terrorism .
local challenges such as unemployment , corruption , islamic extremism and freedom of expression are still challenges he and other candidates have to face .
these elections are just a first step towards a more democratic and multi party political system in egypt to come in the next years .
as a copt egyptian , my main fear is the rise of movements like the islamic brotherhood which , if granted power would make the country live in the medieval centuries .
rami lotfy , toronto , canada the elections in egypt will be held alright but it will be fraud .
mubarak must leave for a new person to come with new ideas , but trust me he will win and the west will say nothing .
kwame , uk president mubarak should have known by now that it is time for him to leave the stage .
ruling a country is not for only one person , more people should be allowed to have chance at power .
a country does not belong to an individual .
the egyptian constitution should peg ruling to only two terms for a person like nigeria , the us and many countries .
adigun olosun , ostbevern , germany -lrb- nigerian -rrb- we left our country because of the corruption , if our president mubarak will be able to correct that , he will get the presidency , if not then we need another president .
however , we do not need an islamic group , which will worsen the conditions in our country .
egyptian , europe i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular robert , montreal , canada i hope that the current president mubarak will win the elections and egypt stays secular .
i do n't want egypt to become a second " iran " .
nobody does .
the only future for egypt for the moment is with mubarak in power and if ever the islamic groups take over egypt , the land of the great pyramids will fall and it wo n't ever get back up on its feet .
robert , montreal , canada most of us believe that mubarak is the only one that can rule egypt , but in twenty-four years , we have n't seen much changes .
i do n't think it will be hard for someone else to get the same knowledge about the country that he has .
we need to wake up and realise that others could be better for ruling .
zamada , niagara falls , canada i think this democratic process will fail in the short term simply because it is not coming from egyptian people but it is imposed on them by foreign powers to serve their short term objective of diverting attention away from what is going on in iraq .
however , in the long term egyptian people wo n't settle with this lip serve and will go to the whole nine yards .
abdi gunnaa , columbus , ohio it is a dream of every egyptian for egypt to turn into a democratic country , but i fear democracy is not at the end of the tunnel even if mubarak goes .
i do not see how far egypt is from the rest of arab world .
however , let us hope for the best .
above all , let there be peace be in that country .
liben w filate , takoma park , md , usa mr mubarak , there is no development without a positive change .
do n't be like most african leaders , who always want to be a naturalised citizen of the state house .
better quit when the ovation is loudest or end up be stampeded out of office .
fidel okaba adie , bekwarra , nigeria i think it is pretty clear with the banning of monitoring bodies that things really have n't changed in terms of democracy , or the lack thereof in egypt .
mubarak , as far as the government and their external allies are concerned , will win forcibly or fairly .
humzah , toronto , canada the election in egypt is just a mere formality .
i am quite convinced that mubarak is going to use his power to win again .
the situation in most african countries are the same .
their presidents never go out of power .
how can the egyptian president come up again for election after 23 years or so of government ?
is he indispensable ?
the truth is that he is there for the will of the western world .
let him go down and allow others to come up with new ideas .
i believe that after 23 years in power he has nothing again for the egyptians .
uchenna , italy i represent the youth of egypt .
i have lived in egypt for 12 years yet i did n't see the effect of democracy taking place there .
there is a saying that absolute power corrupts absolutely and i believe that this is what is happening in egypt .
egypt under his rule has not flourished and therefore he must step down or be prepared to fight with dignity and not attempt to silence his opposition like he always has done .
mohamed , new zealand although it is clear that mubarak will win the election , it would be irresponsible for egyptians not too vote because that would signal that we do n't really want change ... even if these elections are more of a cover than anything else it is still a change that we must express a need for .
not participating only means that we once again accept the rules dictated by the ndp and will not do anything about it .
disregard the local results and press because the foreign media will report the turnout and give a general idea of what really happened .
i believe that no-one else is currently capable of running a country and we need more viable political candidates ...
tamer , egyptian , canada egypt must change the constitution to stop anyone to rule for life .
a president should limited to one or two terms maximum ; then we will see real democracy anonymous democracy always has to start somewhere and this is the first step for egypt and a courageous move by mr mubarak .
it is a once in a life time opportunity for many egyptians to have their voices heard .
it wo n't be easy but now can be the time to rewrite the history egyptian politics .
good luck to all the egyptian people .
garang chut deng , australia i will not go to vote myself , as i have never voted before because i am sure that the government will vote on behalf of me and for all who do not go to vote .
my conditions to vote are : a new , modern constitution which distributes the power , limits to two terms for any candidates and international observation on the election .
bekheet , cairo i 'm an egyptian american living in the us .
this is a sham election aimed at silencing demands from the west for more democracy and openness in egypt .
another goal of this sham election is to give more exposure and legitimacy -ultimately- to mubarak 's son .
mubarak has failed -over 5 terms- to inject some life into the economy and to improve the lives of people in poverty and should not be give another term .
moreover , the campaigning of six weeks is not enough to generate a meaningful campaign for people running against him and is heavily stacked against them .
mubarak will win with a landslide because of his total control over state institutions .
egyptian have to take matters into their own hands by developing institutions to foster democracy and human rights and not wait for gw bush to do the job .
alaa , ny , usa mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that simon johns , cairo , egypt egypt has long been torn by war and terrorism , whilst housing shortages were huge .
mubarak has made egypt a viable country on the world stage and should be recognised for that .
corruption and a lack of democracy are now the big issues .
i do n't think mubarak can cure these ills but in his final presidency , he can create the conditions for a free future .
egypt will become a democratic state at the next elections , not the current one .
mubarak will leave egypt a more peaceful , prosperous and freer nation than he inherited .
simon johns , cairo , egypt yes , it is the beginning of democratic change in egypt , i am egyptian and i am planning to vote in the election because i need to be positive within my society .
although there are 10 candidates in this election , this is the first time for me to hear about nine of them , so i will vote for the candidate that i know .
i hope the coming president will improve the education system , particularly the scientific research and universities .
amro dyab , egypt i am an egyptian living in malaysia , and all i can say about the upcoming elections is that , whatever the outcome is , keep our home safe from the hands of evil wrongdoers .
let 's not let greed or hate get the better of us this time around .
this might be the last chance for us to save our beautiful nation .
so to all egyptian out there , hope for the best .
youssef , kl , malaysia i think democratic change in itself will be a long and slow process in the middle east in general .
for now though , i will be happy to see mr mubarak elected again as he has kept the country stable .
i will definitely be voting for him .
maya mohamed , washington , dc i am an egyptian living in the usa and i feel this election is just a start .
i do not expect it to go forward without mishaps and irregularities .
it has to be taken into account that this is the first multi-candidate election in years .
what relieves me the most is that it opened gates for new and fresh political dynamics .
i hope all eligible voters go to the polls to add the voice of the people into the power equation in egypt .
hany yacoub , usa well , i am an egyptian but i will not be voting as it will be a waste of my time .
we as egyptians know that there is only one winner , not because of his popularity .
we all would love to see a new face , especially as most of us were born and have grown up only experiencing the rule of the same party and same president .
we still have a long way to go democracy .
ahmed , london , uk i agree with previous responders that in middle east , any politician or a contender who does not support american agenda for me , is wasting their time running .
however , i applaud and support those that do run in the face of such enormous challenge .
after all , you start a marathon with a first step .
i hope the arab population as a whole get the guts to determine their own destiny instead of looking up to america , britain and the west .
mike , chicago , usa i challenge any of the voters to be able to clearly describe their candidate 's agenda on issues that matter : education , health , economical reform , foreign policies , etc .
it is hard for me to imagine what criteria we should use to select our next president when we do not know what they stand for .
democracy in its modern form is about succession of power and freedom of speech .
some may simply choose another president to attain partial democracy , but others may not change horses in the middle of the race .
it will take time for democracy to really settle in .
egypt has a history of over 7,000 years .
things take time - a few centuries do not even appear on our time scale .
amr khorshed , houston , usa mr mubarak , please try and organise a free and fair elections in your country , because african leaders never like leaving power ever after tasting it .
i pray you will be honest to yourself .
achungu , tiko , cameroon i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections tina , cairo egypt i find it really ironic to be that proud that we finally got the approval to hold a multi-candidate elections in the 21st century .
this is the least to be done .
however , i do n't feel enthusiastic about voting in the coming elections ; first because the ndp is dominating and second because i 'm not convinced that the elections will be really fair and free .
i 'm positive hosni mubarak will be re-elected , so why bother and vote ?
tina , cairo egypt corruption is an undeniable aspect of perhaps every government in the world .
but to see it conquer a whole nation and inspire only hopelessness and stagnation is difficult for me to stomach as an american .
my own government is not without corruption itself , but freedom only has a future when the people are willing to overcome the tyranny of corruption .
these elections mean nothing unless egypt can find it in themselves to stand for freedom .
thomas , washington dc , usa even though the election results will almost certainly be to mubarak 's favour , i think there is a new political awareness in the country .
people are suddenly interested in what they really want from their president and want to know more about the opposition parties , which were virtually unheard of here .
this is a small but good step forward and at least will start making people get used to multi-candidate elections , political campaigns and programs .
mohammed abada , cairo , egypt in its simplest forms , democracy is about the free choice of the people for those who would govern them .
what freedom of choice is there in the egyptian case when the law has been tailor-fitted to determine who could run , and ultimately win , to curb the " democratise or die " pressure from washington ?
be it political reforms , constitutional amendment , call it what you will .
truth is : it is the same old game , same old players , same old result .
welcome to the middle east , where appearances matter the most !
anonymous , bonn , germany i believe the elections mark a new beginning .
i do n't think mubarak needs to win , but i do not think any of the opposition party leaders are even worth running in the presidential elections .
they have done nothing in the past years except criticise each and every effort of the current government without offering any alternatives .
real hope is in the coming elections , when parties realise the need to work hard to gain people 's trust and the independent candidates have a chance of joining the game .
yasser , cairo , egypt the majority of egyptians have no idea who they are voting for .
some are just voting for " anybody but mubarak " , believing that will benefit the country .
the islamic brotherhood ?
a horrible choice !
it 's almost the year 2006 , we need to move forward .
nothing could be more irresponsible than voting for an " islamic " candidate right now .
i listened to a debate between some of the candidates ... one guy wants the entire egyptian male population to resort to wearing a " tarbouish " , the red fez hat that was worn back during the turkish occupation .
is this not reason enough to go with mubarak ?
at least he can talk and deal with other nations around the world .
hisham ziadi , centreville , virginia funny how none of mubarak 's fans have written in to explain why they support him .
mubarak will win .
the objective is to make sure that his successor is better and democratically elected .
ezajur rahman , kuwait the results are known before the first voter puts his card in the box .
mubarak is forever .
the vast majority of egyptians do n't have voting cards and very few of them go to election centres .
we do n't expect a fair competition .
ayman zohry , cairo , egypt the september 7th election is one small step but a giant leap for hope and democratic change .
hope springs eternal : free and fair elections are a real springboard for better political representation , human rights , better education and particularly equitable women 's rights .
president hosni mubarak was steady at the helm and we should not pour cold water on his immense achievements .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium .
those who criticise the 24 years of leadership and those who believe that our lives have improved to nothing ...
i am afraid they lack political insight .
when mubarak took power we had had just come out of war , under the influence of terrorism which had disrupted our economy .
we were also overpopulated and illiterate .
leaders can not be leaders without the help of their own people .
i think mubarak has done us good , and of course he could have done better , but with someone like him , not fundamentalist or radicalist , there is a brighter tomorrow .
robert george , london first of all , i would like to say that this election is considered a joke for most of the egyptian people .
most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt most are just hoping for a real change in the ruling system .
unemployment and poverty are the subjects that must be solved by the next president .
it 's a big joke , we all know here that president mubarak will win it no doubt , they 're just making the country lose more money by these campaigns .
but most egyptians believe that mr mubarak is the only one that can run this country , he 's the only one who 's able to make a change .
ashraf badr mohamed , giza , egypt if the media says mubarak is going to win , it must be true !
regardless , having a less corrupt candidate win significant votes would be huge .
unfortunately amr mousa , alexandria governor el-mahgoub , or any other known political figures are n't running .
it 's a huge baby step .
adel , alexandria , egypt i think the upcoming elections are a good step forward .
it does break the idea of the president holding the chair until he reaches his grave and reminds the egyptian people that they can hold their government accountable .
but will the government have the courage to hold free and fair elections and accept the results , whatever they are ?
te , berkeley , usa i do n't think the upcoming elections in egypt will make any difference as far as democracy is concerned for two reasons .
one is that the opposition candidates did n't and wo n't have the opportunity that mubarak has to campaign for their election .
most of the media -lrb- in particular , tv and radio -rrb- are owned and run by the government .
the second problem is fairness ; we never had a fair election on any level before and there is no reason or guarantee now that this one would be different .
ashraf , cairo , egypt the upcoming election in egypt is noting but a farce ; it does not in anyway signal the beginning of democratic change in egypt .
the incumbent , hosni mubarak , who is almost certain to win a fifth term in office should stand down and let new people with fresh ideas enter the political arena in egypt .
in short , mr mubarak 's stepping aside will signal the real beginning of democratic change in egypt .
mohammed mulat , san jose , ca usa good to see egypt slowly moving towards true democracy .
the most important issue is definitely the economy and building a basis of a legal framework and corruption-free institutions .
also , i would like to see more economic interaction between egypt and israel in the future .
sultan koreishy , ny , usa good start , but i would n't vote , since the results are already written and only ready to be published .
egyptian , canada if this " open " election is a sign of democratic change , then why is it that all over egypt there are huge banners with hosni mubarak 's face all over them and none with the faces of opposition leaders ?
i lived in cairo from january to june and in my time there , i saw only mubarak propaganda .
i read stories about opposition leaders being jailed and opposition newspapers not being distributed to the general public .
even if these opposition leaders were truly allowed to step forward and these newspapers were published , i doubt anyone but mubarak would win anyway .
egypt .
ann , madison , wisconsin , united states i am concerned that egyptians like myself were not allowed to vote because almost all of us three million living abroad would not have voted for mubarak .
i am concerned about the amount of coverage mubarak is getting compared to everybody else , this election is far from fair and i am sure there will br rigging otherwise mubarak would not win .
there should have been international observers and independent candidates should have been allowed to run because almost certainly mubarak would have lost .
ashraf afifi , st annes , lancashire , england in spite of all the negative aspects of this election , it is a step ahead towards egyptian democracy , many steps in fact .
a lot of taboos are being broken and we are moving into a new era of free speech .
we might not see any tangible results now but i am looking forward to the 2011 elections .
ahmed , cairo , egypt although the results of this election may be a forgone conclusion , i strongly believe that it is a big step in the right direction for democracy in egypt .
the building blocks have been laid for the future generations to reap the benefits .
democracy is n't built in a day or a week or a month , it takes years .
i would also like to add that although all the candidates have claimed that they would abolish the emergency laws once they are elected , its interesting to consider that the us and uk are beginning to implement their own versions of the emergency laws themselves because that is the only effective way to clamp down on the terrorists .
an egyptian , uae although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt although i believe the so-called elections will be unfair and may be faked , i am going to participate .
i just think my participation will add another vote to those who are going to say " no , we do n't want mubarak to rule us for another six years ! "
twenty-four years of totalitarianism is enough .
i say anyone ... will be much better than mubarak .
ahmed gamal , cairo , egypt this is mere acting ... we know that mubarak will win , and despite all that is being said about the fairness and integrity of these elections , in fact they are fake .
the state is trying to " look beautiful " before the world , while it is actually extremely ugly .
the egyptian people are in dire need for the " re-exploration " of their true ideology and identity , not that imposed on them by the militants and islamists who came after the 1952 revolution .
till then we pray that god may save our country and bless it .
joy maher , cairo , egypt i will vote for ayman nour , it 's time to change , 24 years is more than enough .
what else mubarak can add , he 's very greedy and he has to give chances to new leaders .
gqmal helmi , alexandria , egypt i am an egyptian living in the uk .
i am sure that if i were in egypt i would vote for mubarak or abstain from voting all together .
the opposing candidates are so weak that there is no other choice but mubarak .
the egyptian public seems to follow the saying of ' better the devil you know ' ...
may , uk as an expatriate in cairo for the past few years , there has been visible changes in egypt and vague indications of a better tomorrow .
however , a ' liberalised ' electoral process does not prove anything if electoral promises for real and effective change are not put to action .
has the average egyptian benefited substantially from the recent changes or is it just superficial ?
democratic change must be done at an acceptable pace to the country 's electorate - not too fast , not too slow , and definitely not influenced by external sources .
vincent wong , cairo , egypt enough of 24 years of dictatorship .
for 24 years , we have seen our lives improve very little .
a country with the resources of egypt should have a much better economy .
we want accountability .
we want a voice in determining our future .
mubarak is not that voice .
sherif sadek , egyptian , nyc these elections are a sham .
mubarak 's dictatorial regime , lacking legitimacy and in a crisis , is struggling to create legitimacy for itself through presidential elections and appearing democratic .
the whole electoral process has been a farce from its inception and the regime has illegally manipulated the process to make it impossible for anyone but mubarak to win .
so of course i will not vote , as voting only helps the regime 's legitimacy .
mohamed elwan , cairo , egypt this election is little more than a comedy to please the americans .
but one must be responsible : real and fair elections for the parliament would certainly bring an overwhelming majority for the muslim brotherhood by far the main political force in egypt .
so mubarak is preferable .
jean-paul dogeut , paris , france i wish the egyptian people a fair and democratic vote , where the rightful party may come to power with the majority of the people backing them with due respect .
esra karatash alpay , istanbul , turkey i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i think it is such a good step that mubarak has taken .
i feel so happy to see the banners and billboards of other candidates in the streets , a scene that i 've never seen in my entire life .
many people say that the whole election thing is a big hoax and some parties have already boycotted the election , but i call this narrow-mindedness .
those people have been given a chance never offered , they better use it rather than waste it .
i believe that mubarak is the best among all the candidates on the scene because none of them is famous or known by the people .
i think if other influential figures ran for presidency they could change much .
abdel rahman ismail , giza , egypt i am from the neighbouring country of sudan .
i was happy to learn that egypt is opening doors for democracy .
allowing multi-candidate elections is a good start and egyptians and the world must work hard to see that it 's free and fair .
mr. mubarak 's regime is not good for africa and sudan in particular and in my opinion , he should give others the chance of changing egypt and north africa for the better .
i do n't think the elections will be fair because african politics are not straight forward but influenced by power and money .
all i can say is " good luck " to the egyptian people .
daniel deng , dallas and denver , usa in egypt , under the rule of mubarak , people are being denied of their basic democratic rights which we take for granted in the west .
but the irony is that the forces who are against modernisation and secularism , like the islamic brotherhood stand to gain and tilt the balance in favour of the fundamentalists within the egyptian society using the democratic system of voting .
it is happening in iraq and will happen also in egypt .
thanks to the policies of the americans in supporting the oppressive regimes in that part of the world , people automatically go after elements who oppose any concept which originates from the west .
dictatorship will be replaced by die-hard islamic fundamentalism .
it is a disappointing trend for the future of egypt and the middle east .
srinivasan toft , denmark only three weeks for competitors to campaign , strict conditions for running , emergency law , thousands in prison without trial , biased administration and media , no international monitoring and prosecuting strong competitors ... this is just a one man show directed by and starring the mubarak family .
anon , cairo , egypt this election could be the beginning of democratic change in egypt or any other middle east country , only if people go to the polling stations to vote instead of grumbling , complaining or boycotting .
every vote cast counts , even if your candidate does not have a chance to win .
mohamed mursal , dubai , uae despite the fact that the outcome of the elections is almost certain with mubarak winning , the presidential elections are proving to be a very important exercise , a sort of dry run , for the next elections in six years .
the egyptian people are getting used to this new and exciting chance to elect their president and there is no doubt that the process has proved to be of high entertainment value .
i for one am optimistic .
hanan nayel , cairo , egypt this time around , it is a cosmetic change , but we egyptians need to understand that mubarak can not be overthrown and all these " democratic " changes will only truly kick in following his death .
egypt has never had an " ex " president ... only former deceased presidents and there are many good reasons for that .
people need to understand that this change is not meant for current times , but there is definitely an air of optimism .
i 'll vote in six years ' time .
mohamed safi , cairo , egypt it 's a beginning , but the politics and the culture of the middle east are not about individual thought or rights but about extreme religious life- models and it 's about following the crowd in order to be safe .
it wo n't be easy to resist the deeply entrenched manipulation of elections by the most ambitious and unfortunately , often the most ruthless .
egypt could have a worse leader than mubarak , though he does n't impress me very much .
i hope for some progress in some countries in the middle east , eventually joining together for mutual progress .
the people need a dependable way to vote to make things better and know their vote actually counts .
mary weaver , windham , nh usa i will vote .
i believe the elections will be free and fair .
if mishaps happen they will be individual acts .
the candidates presenting themselves in this elections are not the optimal candidates .
it 's not the ruling party 's mistake that strong competition did not rise to the occasion .
egyptians need to be less critical and start acting even when they do n't get what they wanted .
what should drive egypt is not the government but the egyptian citizen .
soha omar , cairo , egypt instead of 98 % support he will end up with a 75 % .
it 's not good enough i am afraid .
khan , australia i am sick to death of the opposition 's inane complaints and accusations .
i hope they stop being sore losers and give the elections their best shot .
i think ayman nour and his gang know how limited support for them is in egypt and are hence accusing the regime of anything and everything just to get their name in the news .
madjdy al-qaramany , cairo this coming election is the right step in the right direction omorodion osula , boston , usa it is good thing to see that democracy is in the making in egypt .
this coming election is the right step in the right direction .
it will open a different chapter in egyptian history and egyptians will be able to evaluate the pros and cones of this election .
democracy can not be achieved overnight .
a journey of 1,000 kilometres begins with one step .
it will take time for things to get better and manifest itself .
in every election , there is always one form of discrepancy or the other .
the most important thing is that an attempt has been made and whatever lesson learnt in this coming election will help to determine the direction of future election .
omorodion osula , boston , usa i would rather say that these elections are just a passage for democracy .
however , egypt will not be able to cross this passage until the aging president steps down along with all of his aging regime members .
yes , i 'm egyptian and i will not vote simply because there is n't no right candidate i can vote for .
the most important issues are just too many to state .
mohamed fouad , new york , usa this election is a farce .
mr mubarak has been ruling egypt for the last 24 years , with an iron fist under the pretext of national security .
under pressure from his protector , the us , he introduced some reforms in a multi-candidate scheme .
this a trick to show that he is a reformer , while in fact he is a typical corrupt dictator .
he is running for another term to solidify his party grip on power and ensure the transfer of power to his son .
for the last 24 years , egyptians suffered high unemployment , poverty and government corruption .
the reforms mr mubarak talk about now could have been implemented the first term of his rule .
enough is enough of the mubarak rule , but because of his grip on power , he will be re-elected and no change will occur for egypt .
the same story all over the middle east .
abdallah , chicago , us the results of all the previous egyptian elections have seen mubarak attain a 99.9 % majority vote .
that 's only 0.1 % less than saddam hussein 's last election results .
with the rules and regulations surrounding who can setup a political party and what their ideology and to whom their allegiance must be -lrb- i.e. mubarak -rrb- there will never be free elections , only more of the same showpieces .
we can all pat ourselves on the back then and say how democratic our allies are , unlike those despots we overthrow in the name of democracy .
ibrahim , london , england , uk i think that enough is enough for mr mubarak and for the sake of egypt 's democracy .
he 's been in office for far too long and i have my doubts that the polls will be free and fair .
for the opposition parties who are boycotting the vote , i say that the decision is a stupid one because this is the chance for the opposition parties to make egyptian democracy a model for middle east .
if they boycott , the egyptian people will be suffer a lack of choice on whom to vote for .
firdaus , singapore i find it amusing that all the these egyptian political hopefuls bother campaigning , because in the end only a us friendly candidate will be allowed to win or failing that , hosni mubarak will be re-elected .
a fine example of us democracy in the middle east .

a report from new philanthropy capital said the government had not improved truancy levels over the past 10 years despite spending £ 1bn on the problem .
but education secretary ruth kelly said the money had been well spent .
and she said local authorities should use every power available to them to reduce truancy .
the report claims official government figures " significantly under-estimate " the true scale of the problem because they use registration details as an indicator .
two thirds of pupils admitted they were present for registration and then skipped particular lessons , the report said .
and it said a " plethora of government initiatives " had failed to improve unauthorised absence rates .
' no progress ' npc , a charity that advises donors and funders on how to give more effectively , said permanent exclusions had risen by 20 % since 2000 .
it said league tables and more choice for parents over their child 's schooling encouraged head teachers to expel more disruptive children .
and children who played truant or were excluded were more likely to face health problems or become involved in crime in the future .
speaking to radio 4 's today programme , head of research at new philanthropy capital martin brookes said truancy had ' flat-lined ' over the past seven or eight years .
" close to 1 % of school days are lost through truanting and the level of exclusions is now on the rise - it reaches about 10,000 excluded each year .
" the government has spent over £ 1bn on this without any apparent , tangible progress to date . "
he said that some initiatives undertaken by charities were more effective because they tackled the underlying problems of truancy .
these charities could help by providing emotional and practical support which could be missing in their family lives , he went on .
" there is a big economic incentive for society to tackle this issue , quite apart from the human suffering involved , " he said .
a separate report by campaign group action on rights for children claimed truancy sweeps were an inefficient use of police time because two out of three children had legitimate reasons for not being in school .
the group surveyed 120 local education authorities and found more than 16,000 police hours were spent each year looking for truants , equivalent to a year 's work for 10 police officers , according to the group .
' parents ' responsibility ' but ruth kelly said measures such as fixed penalty notices were having a " marked effect " .
only a " tiny proportion " of the money which had been spent was on purely anti-truancy measures , with most spent on schemes such as learning mentors , to try to improve behaviour .
ruth kelly has defended the government 's record on truancy she said it was important to convey the message to parents that it was their responsibility to ensure their child attended school .
" where local councils have taken the powers that the government has given them , for instance to impose a fine on parents or to force a parent to attend a parenting class , we 've seen dramatic falls in the truancy levels , " she said .
a spokesman for the department of education and skills said overall school attendance was at record levels , and absences from secondary schools continued to fall with some 3,000 more pupils attending school each day compared to last year .
over 11,500 parents were placed on the fast track to prosecution scheme to improve their child 's attendance within a term or face prosecution , the spokesman said .
but parents facing challenging circumstances would be supported .

a report from new philanthropy capital said the government had not improved truancy levels over the past 10 years despite spending £ 1bn on the problem .
but education secretary ruth kelly said the money had been well spent .
and she said local authorities should use every power available to them to reduce truancy .
the report claims official government figures " significantly under-estimate " the true scale of the problem because they use registration details as an indicator .
two thirds of pupils admitted they were present for registration and then skipped particular lessons , the report said .
and it said a " plethora of government initiatives " had failed to improve unauthorised absence rates .
' no progress ' npc , a charity that advises donors and funders on how to give more effectively , said permanent exclusions had risen by 20 % since 2000 .
it said league tables and more choice for parents over their child 's schooling encouraged head teachers to expel more disruptive children .
and children who played truant or were excluded were more likely to face health problems or become involved in crime in the future .
speaking to radio 4 's today programme , head of research at new philanthropy capital martin brookes said truancy had ' flat-lined ' over the past seven or eight years .
" close to 1 % of school days are lost through truanting and the level of exclusions is now on the rise - it reaches about 10,000 excluded each year .
" the government has spent over £ 1bn on this without any apparent , tangible progress to date . "
he said that some initiatives undertaken by charities were more effective because they tackled the underlying problems of truancy .
these charities could help by providing emotional and practical support which could be missing in their family lives , he went on .
" there is a big economic incentive for society to tackle this issue , quite apart from the human suffering involved , " he said .
a separate report by campaign group action on rights for children claimed truancy sweeps were an inefficient use of police time because two out of three children had legitimate reasons for not being in school .
the group surveyed 120 local education authorities and found more than 16,000 police hours were spent each year looking for truants , equivalent to a year 's work for 10 police officers , according to the group .
' parents ' responsibility ' but ruth kelly said measures such as fixed penalty notices were having a " marked effect " .
only a " tiny proportion " of the money which had been spent was on purely anti-truancy measures , with most spent on schemes such as learning mentors , to try to improve behaviour .
ruth kelly has defended the government 's record on truancy she said it was important to convey the message to parents that it was their responsibility to ensure their child attended school .
" where local councils have taken the powers that the government has given them , for instance to impose a fine on parents or to force a parent to attend a parenting class , we 've seen dramatic falls in the truancy levels , " she said .
a spokesman for the department of education and skills said overall school attendance was at record levels , and absences from secondary schools continued to fall with some 3,000 more pupils attending school each day compared to last year .
over 11,500 parents were placed on the fast track to prosecution scheme to improve their child 's attendance within a term or face prosecution , the spokesman said .

the cabinet said government offices will close on fridays and saturdays but the working day will be an hour longer .
government officials say the country 's fragile economy is under pressure because of soaring global oil prices and a shortfall in crop production .
private businesses in the country of 140 million people will continue to work a six-day week .
' growth threatened ' the decision to introduce the two-day weekend was taken at a cabinet meeting on monday , chaired by prime minister khaleda zia .
" introducing a five-day work week will reduce use of transport by both public and private sectors , thus saving costly fuel and easing pressure on foreign exchange required to import oil , " one energy official was quoted saying by reuters news agency .
economist abul barakat told the afp news agency that the government could save nearly $ 12m a year in fuel costs alone by introducing the five-day working week .
but garment manufacturers , bangladesh 's biggest private sector employers , oppose the shorter week .
" it comes at a time when we are witnessing growth in the garment sector .
a country like bangladesh can not afford this luxury , " the president of the bangladesh garments manufacturers and exporters association , anisul haq , told afp .

researchers surveyed drug prices in 15 towns and cities and found ketamine on sale in eight .
it did not feature at all in the same survey last year .
the drug is currently legal to possess but the government intends to make it class c before the end of 2005 .
drugscope also found ecstasy on sale from just 50p a pill .
' out of body ' effect spokeswoman for drugscope , petra maxwell , said the survey 's findings on ketamine highlighted a worrying trend : " it is a drug that is very easy to take a higher dosage than is intended , even for experienced users , " she said .
" you can get some unpleasant side effects , nausea , vomiting , and at the highest doses people can collapse and lose consciousness . "
ketamine is a general anaesthetic which has been used in hospitals and in veterinary medicine since the 1970s .
ketamine on sale survey found ketamine in : london manchester gloucester birmingham belfast cardiff nottingham portsmouth full survey results among recreational users it is also known as k or special k and can be in powder , tablet or liquid form .
effects depend on the dose but users report euphoria , hallucinations and " dissociative " feelings in which mind and body seem to separate .
it can be dangerous when taken in conjunction with alcohol or other depressants and users can be unable to move or feel pain while on the drug .
anecdotal evidence suggests that ketamine use has been gradually increasing for several years - particularly on the gay scene - but it has recently become popular among mainstream club-goers .
" ketamine has now established its place alongside the usual dance scene drugs like ecstasy , " nottingham drugs worker pete hurd told druglink magazine in which the findings were published .
crack deals the drugscope survey - in which researchers spoke to 40 frontline drugs agencies in a range of places from glasgow to torquay - also found new trends in the way drugs are sold .
portsmouth is a lovely city and there is not that much crime , but the drugs problem is massive jason roberts , drugs project worker city reels from cheap heroin one common development is heroin and crack being sold together in " two for one " or other discounted deals .
and in portsmouth the price of heroin has halved in the past year , a move accompanied by dealers advertising their wares with calling cards placed near needle exchanges .
jason roberts , a drugs project worker in the city , said : " we have seen a huge increase in clients -lsb- drug users -rsb- over the last 12 months .
" portsmouth is a lovely city and there is not that much crime , but the drugs problem is massive . "
regional differences ecstasy was also cheapest in portsmouth with pills costing from 50p to £ 2 .
however , the place with the cheapest heroin was sheffield at £ 25 a gram .
the survey also highlights regional differences such as the fact that crack is rarely sold in belfast and glasgow .
users in these cities prefer to buy cocaine powder and convert it to crack themselves , according to drugs workers on the ground .
" we are seeing significant regional variations in both drug usage and drug markets , " said harry shapiro , editor of druglink .
" the emergence of ketamine as a key substance of choice is and entirely new phenomenon since we last carried out the survey in 2004 when it did n't figure at all . "
