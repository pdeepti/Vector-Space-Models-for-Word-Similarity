he also said he may leave the team even if they lift the trophy in front of a home crowd . not yet ready to write off his team 's chances at winning next summer 's tournament in front of thousands of ecstatic german fans , klinsmann admitted germany is n't his top pick . " i think it will be possible for germany to win the world cup but we need luck , a lot of luck , " he said .
" the south americans are very strong , and i see brazil and argentina as the favorites . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto carlos , ronaldinho and adriano , left to right , are favorites again in 2006 even if he seems to lack a bit of self-confidence , klinsmann still has not backed away from his goal of winning the title . the extra spark that comes from playing on home turf can often push a team to unexpected highs .
in the last world cup the home field advantage helped underdog south korea into the semifinals . home turf n ot a guara n tee " it helped a favorite like france win the title in 1998 , and we also profited from it when we were the champions in 1974 , " said german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , who captained the 1974 german side .
" i find it courageous and correct that jürgen klinsmann has such a goal for his team . " despite the " kaiser 's " words of praise , hosting the world cup does n't necessarily translate to success : of the 17 finals so far , only seven have gone to the host nation . germa n y side struggles with youth sympathetic fans might be enough to perk up the german team after a series of lackluster friendly matches .
their best play came during last summer 's confederations cup , where the home fans were treated to a german side that scored a tournament high of 15 goals and finished third , tying argentina and losing to brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger players had much to celebrate during the confederations cup much like during the confederations cup , klinsmann has fielded young teams for germany 's most international matches .
he said it 's the team 's youth that keep them from claiming international glory . " we have a very , very young team , but our players are learning and getting better , " klinsmann said .
" they need more time to develop , and i think that in four or five years we 'll have a really strong team . " kli n sma n n 's future still u n clear klinsmann , however , has left a question mark on whether he 'll be around to guide a more experienced team .

a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .

pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .

it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience .

the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .

her brother and mother are n't struggling , either . susanne klatten , a 43-year-old mother of three , got her wealth the old-fashioned way : she inherited it .
her father was the legendary industrialist herbert quandt , the man who made bmw the luxury-car colossus it is today .
when he died , in 1982 , he left susanne , her younger brother stefan , and his third wife johanna quandt his bmw holdings and other assets . in addition to a 12.5-percent bmw stake , susanne got a controlling share in altana , one of europe 's most successful pharmaceutical and chemical concerns .
herbert quandt also left vast sums to the children from his first two marriages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan quandt is not quite as rich as his sister today , klatten is valued at around $ 9 billion -lrb- 7.8 billion euros -rrb- , which leaves her in fourth place on a list of the richest germans , as published in october by manager magazine .
her brother stefan quandt , worth $ 6.7 billion , is number 11 on that list .
while very private , the handsome 38-year-old billionaire often makes " germany 's most eligible bachelors " lists . comi n g up the ra n ks klatten 's mother , johanna , was herbert quandt 's longtime secretary and his third and last wife .
she has a fortune estimated at $ 5.4 billion .
on the roster of the world 's wealthiest women , klatten places eighth and johanna quandt places tenth . after she finished high school , susanne klatten studied business and economics in frankfurt and later earned an mba from the imd business school in lausanne , switzerland .
but much of what she learned was through the on-the-job training she got in a series of internships inside her family 's empire .
she held these positions under assumed names - understandable for someone who wants to be taken on her own terms . at the bmw factory in regensburg , quandt did a traineeship under the name susanne kant .
there she met the engineer jan klatten , who knew nothing of her extreme wealth . " i wanted to find out if he really loved me , " she is quoted as saying .
the pair married in 1990 . extreme wealth , extreme privacy klatten leads an exceptionally private life , is almost never interviewed and rarely seen in public .
the desire for privacy may be attributed to a near-miss kidnapping attempt on susanne when she was 16 . when she is out in public , observers often comment that klatten , a pretty woman with short hair and a wide smile , dresses in an elegant but low-key style .
very little is known of her personal life , except that she , her husband , and three children live in munich .
she has only given a single interview in her career , to quandt biographer rüdiger jungbluth .
according to bild tabloid , she told jungbluth her life is " multi-faceted . " from 1989 to 1990 , klatten worked as management board assistant at the hubert burda media concern .
after further study in boston , she began taking seats on various corporate boards .
in 1993 she joined the board of altana and is credited with helping transform the company into a world-class corporation , with $ 4 billion in revenue in 2004 . joi n i n g the bmw board in 1997 she and her brother assumed her mother 's place on the bmw board ; today she concentrates her energies almost exclusively on bmw .
as a member of the board there , klatten helped the company engineer the controversial 2000 buyback of rover .
when bmw consequently hit the skids , she oversaw the removal of bmw ceo bernd pischetsrieder . during world war ii , bmw 's fortunes boomed largely on the back of forced labor ; prisoners were often made to work in miserable conditions .
today , quandt foundations give money to charities for former forced laborers and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johanna quandt is the world 's 10th-richest woman susanne and her brother stefan will one day inherit the bmw shares of their mother , who is turning 80 next year .
they have made it their goal to secure bmw 's independence over the long term .
long ago their father saved the company from bankruptcy , and the heirs clearly feel an obligation .
bmw has developed superbly with the quandt family at its helm . " we are n't keeping our stake for the sake of our egos , " klatten once said , according to the magazine stern .
" we keep things peaceful , and people like that .

so far , only france and germany have such plants . ' two-way street ' humbert said the memorandum set the scene for the expected plane order on monday , saying that was " the other part of this two-way street : to have more contracts , to have more aircraft flying in china .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .

22 , should tell the legislature what he knew about the abduction . " we will question the government on this and push for a clarification , " beck said . according to a report published by the washi n gto n post - and contrary to berlin 's claims - the former german government had been informed about at least one case of a cia abduction of a terror suspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane that was allegedly used for transporting terror suspects in may last year , daniel coats , the then united states ambassador in berlin , told schily that khaled el-masri - a german citizen - had been wrongfully held by the cia but would soon be released , according to the report . el-masri was abducted by the american intelligence agency in 2003 and spent 5 months in a prison in afghanistan . german public prosecutors such as eberhard beyer have started to look into the case of khaled el-masri , issuing arrest warrants against 22 people allegedly involved in the abduction . " these agents were operating on german soil which automatically means they committed their crimes under german jurisdiction , " beyer said .
" that is why we 've started legal investigations on grounds of coercion and deprivation of liberty rights . " schily , a social democrat , has so far not commented on the case .

" in an interview with public broadcaster rbb , erler added that expected us officials to inform their german counterparts about allegations regarding secret cia flights transporting terror suspects across german air space .
the united states airbase in frankfurt allegedly was the hub of clandestine cia operations , which have triggered a public outcry in europe . but erler said it was n't clear whether such information would become available during us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit to berlin late monday and tuesday . hadley de n ies allegatio n s in an interview for cnn on sunday , us national security advisor stephen hadley gave a first impression of the type of answer europeans can expect . " the terrorists threaten all of us , " he said .
" this is a threat really to the civilized world .
we need to cooperate together to deal with this terrorist threat .
that cooperation is characterized by three things : one , we comply with us constitution , us laws and us treaty obligations .
secondly , we respect the sovereignty of those countries with whom we are cooperating , and three - we do not move people around the world so that they can be tortured . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with bush in february in mainz , germany german chancellor angela merkel , who is trying to get german-us relations back on a more friendly footing , has said that she believes the americans will clear up the case .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .
15-16 brussels summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- l . -rrb- and tony blair will likely meet in order to avoid another budget fiasco if the budget it not ratified by the end of britain 's presidency term in december , the job will fall to austria , which takes over the rotating presidency on jan .

" these agents were operating on german soil which automatically means they committed their crimes under german jurisdiction , " beyer said .

" in an interview with public broadcaster rbb , erler added that expected us officials to inform their german counterparts about allegations regarding secret cia flights transporting terror suspects across german air space .
the united states airbase in frankfurt allegedly was the hub of clandestine cia operations , which have triggered a public outcry in europe . but erler said it was n't clear whether such information would become available during us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit to berlin late monday and tuesday . hadley de n ies allegatio n s in an interview for cnn on sunday , us national security advisor stephen hadley gave a first impression of the type of answer europeans can expect . " the terrorists threaten all of us , " he said .
" this is a threat really to the civilized world .
we need to cooperate together to deal with this terrorist threat .
that cooperation is characterized by three things : one , we comply with us constitution , us laws and us treaty obligations .
secondly , we respect the sovereignty of those countries with whom we are cooperating , and three - we do not move people around the world so that they can be tortured .

a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .

they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .

her brother and mother are n't struggling , either . susanne klatten , a 43-year-old mother of three , got her wealth the old-fashioned way : she inherited it .
her father was the legendary industrialist herbert quandt , the man who made bmw the luxury-car colossus it is today .
when he died , in 1982 , he left susanne , her younger brother stefan , and his third wife johanna quandt his bmw holdings and other assets . in addition to a 12.5-percent bmw stake , susanne got a controlling share in altana , one of europe 's most successful pharmaceutical and chemical concerns .
herbert quandt also left vast sums to the children from his first two marriages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan quandt is not quite as rich as his sister today , klatten is valued at around $ 9 billion -lrb- 7.8 billion euros -rrb- , which leaves her in fourth place on a list of the richest germans , as published in october by manager magazine .
her brother stefan quandt , worth $ 6.7 billion , is number 11 on that list .
while very private , the handsome 38-year-old billionaire often makes " germany 's most eligible bachelors " lists . comi n g up the ra n ks klatten 's mother , johanna , was herbert quandt 's longtime secretary and his third and last wife .
she has a fortune estimated at $ 5.4 billion .
on the roster of the world 's wealthiest women , klatten places eighth and johanna quandt places tenth . after she finished high school , susanne klatten studied business and economics in frankfurt and later earned an mba from the imd business school in lausanne , switzerland .
but much of what she learned was through the on-the-job training she got in a series of internships inside her family 's empire .
she held these positions under assumed names - understandable for someone who wants to be taken on her own terms . at the bmw factory in regensburg , quandt did a traineeship under the name susanne kant .
there she met the engineer jan klatten , who knew nothing of her extreme wealth . " i wanted to find out if he really loved me , " she is quoted as saying .
the pair married in 1990 . extreme wealth , extreme privacy klatten leads an exceptionally private life , is almost never interviewed and rarely seen in public .
the desire for privacy may be attributed to a near-miss kidnapping attempt on susanne when she was 16 . when she is out in public , observers often comment that klatten , a pretty woman with short hair and a wide smile , dresses in an elegant but low-key style .
very little is known of her personal life , except that she , her husband , and three children live in munich .
she has only given a single interview in her career , to quandt biographer rüdiger jungbluth .
according to bild tabloid , she told jungbluth her life is " multi-faceted . " from 1989 to 1990 , klatten worked as management board assistant at the hubert burda media concern .
after further study in boston , she began taking seats on various corporate boards .
in 1993 she joined the board of altana and is credited with helping transform the company into a world-class corporation , with $ 4 billion in revenue in 2004 . joi n i n g the bmw board in 1997 she and her brother assumed her mother 's place on the bmw board ; today she concentrates her energies almost exclusively on bmw .
as a member of the board there , klatten helped the company engineer the controversial 2000 buyback of rover .
when bmw consequently hit the skids , she oversaw the removal of bmw ceo bernd pischetsrieder . during world war ii , bmw 's fortunes boomed largely on the back of forced labor ; prisoners were often made to work in miserable conditions .
today , quandt foundations give money to charities for former forced laborers and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johanna quandt is the world 's 10th-richest woman susanne and her brother stefan will one day inherit the bmw shares of their mother , who is turning 80 next year .
they have made it their goal to secure bmw 's independence over the long term .
long ago their father saved the company from bankruptcy , and the heirs clearly feel an obligation .
bmw has developed superbly with the quandt family at its helm . " we are n't keeping our stake for the sake of our egos , " klatten once said , according to the magazine stern .
" we keep things peaceful , and people like that .

so far , only france and germany have such plants .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .
another entry praised the " courage " of the youth group to produce something like this in " straitlaced bavaria . " church reactions the pastor of the church where the youth group is based does n't understand all the fuss , saying he finds it admirable " that young people are getting involved with bible history . "
the fierceness of the criticism shows , in his opinion , " how far removed many adults are from the reality of young people 's lives , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . while the bavarian protestant church had provided no official comment on the matter , the region 's catholic archdiocese is very clear where it stands on the matter . " it 's not ok to pose naked in a church , " winfried röhmel , spokesman for the archbishop of munich , friedrich wetter , told der spiegel .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

her brother and mother are n't struggling , either . susanne klatten , a 43-year-old mother of three , got her wealth the old-fashioned way : she inherited it .
her father was the legendary industrialist herbert quandt , the man who made bmw the luxury-car colossus it is today .
when he died , in 1982 , he left susanne , her younger brother stefan , and his third wife johanna quandt his bmw holdings and other assets . in addition to a 12.5-percent bmw stake , susanne got a controlling share in altana , one of europe 's most successful pharmaceutical and chemical concerns .
herbert quandt also left vast sums to the children from his first two marriages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan quandt is not quite as rich as his sister today , klatten is valued at around $ 9 billion -lrb- 7.8 billion euros -rrb- , which leaves her in fourth place on a list of the richest germans , as published in october by manager magazine .
her brother stefan quandt , worth $ 6.7 billion , is number 11 on that list .
while very private , the handsome 38-year-old billionaire often makes " germany 's most eligible bachelors " lists . comi n g up the ra n ks klatten 's mother , johanna , was herbert quandt 's longtime secretary and his third and last wife .
she has a fortune estimated at $ 5.4 billion .
on the roster of the world 's wealthiest women , klatten places eighth and johanna quandt places tenth . after she finished high school , susanne klatten studied business and economics in frankfurt and later earned an mba from the imd business school in lausanne , switzerland .
but much of what she learned was through the on-the-job training she got in a series of internships inside her family 's empire .
she held these positions under assumed names - understandable for someone who wants to be taken on her own terms . at the bmw factory in regensburg , quandt did a traineeship under the name susanne kant .
there she met the engineer jan klatten , who knew nothing of her extreme wealth . " i wanted to find out if he really loved me , " she is quoted as saying .
the pair married in 1990 . extreme wealth , extreme privacy klatten leads an exceptionally private life , is almost never interviewed and rarely seen in public .
the desire for privacy may be attributed to a near-miss kidnapping attempt on susanne when she was 16 . when she is out in public , observers often comment that klatten , a pretty woman with short hair and a wide smile , dresses in an elegant but low-key style .
very little is known of her personal life , except that she , her husband , and three children live in munich .
she has only given a single interview in her career , to quandt biographer rüdiger jungbluth .
according to bild tabloid , she told jungbluth her life is " multi-faceted . " from 1989 to 1990 , klatten worked as management board assistant at the hubert burda media concern .
after further study in boston , she began taking seats on various corporate boards .
in 1993 she joined the board of altana and is credited with helping transform the company into a world-class corporation , with $ 4 billion in revenue in 2004 . joi n i n g the bmw board in 1997 she and her brother assumed her mother 's place on the bmw board ; today she concentrates her energies almost exclusively on bmw .
as a member of the board there , klatten helped the company engineer the controversial 2000 buyback of rover .
when bmw consequently hit the skids , she oversaw the removal of bmw ceo bernd pischetsrieder . during world war ii , bmw 's fortunes boomed largely on the back of forced labor ; prisoners were often made to work in miserable conditions .
today , quandt foundations give money to charities for former forced laborers and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johanna quandt is the world 's 10th-richest woman susanne and her brother stefan will one day inherit the bmw shares of their mother , who is turning 80 next year .
they have made it their goal to secure bmw 's independence over the long term .
long ago their father saved the company from bankruptcy , and the heirs clearly feel an obligation .
bmw has developed superbly with the quandt family at its helm . " we are n't keeping our stake for the sake of our egos , " klatten once said , according to the magazine stern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .
another entry praised the " courage " of the youth group to produce something like this in " straitlaced bavaria . " church reactions the pastor of the church where the youth group is based does n't understand all the fuss , saying he finds it admirable " that young people are getting involved with bible history . "
the fierceness of the criticism shows , in his opinion , " how far removed many adults are from the reality of young people 's lives , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . while the bavarian protestant church had provided no official comment on the matter , the region 's catholic archdiocese is very clear where it stands on the matter . " it 's not ok to pose naked in a church , " winfried röhmel , spokesman for the archbishop of munich , friedrich wetter , told der spiegel .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .
another entry praised the " courage " of the youth group to produce something like this in " straitlaced bavaria . " church reactions the pastor of the church where the youth group is based does n't understand all the fuss , saying he finds it admirable " that young people are getting involved with bible history . "
the fierceness of the criticism shows , in his opinion , " how far removed many adults are from the reality of young people 's lives , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . while the bavarian protestant church had provided no official comment on the matter , the region 's catholic archdiocese is very clear where it stands on the matter . " it 's not ok to pose naked in a church , " winfried röhmel , spokesman for the archbishop of munich , friedrich wetter , told der spiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .
15-16 brussels summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- l . -rrb- and tony blair will likely meet in order to avoid another budget fiasco if the budget it not ratified by the end of britain 's presidency term in december , the job will fall to austria , which takes over the rotating presidency on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .
another entry praised the " courage " of the youth group to produce something like this in " straitlaced bavaria . " church reactions the pastor of the church where the youth group is based does n't understand all the fuss , saying he finds it admirable " that young people are getting involved with bible history . "
the fierceness of the criticism shows , in his opinion , " how far removed many adults are from the reality of young people 's lives , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . while the bavarian protestant church had provided no official comment on the matter , the region 's catholic archdiocese is very clear where it stands on the matter . " it 's not ok to pose naked in a church , " winfried röhmel , spokesman for the archbishop of munich , friedrich wetter , told der spiegel .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .

just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .
15-16 brussels summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- l . -rrb- and tony blair will likely meet in order to avoid another budget fiasco if the budget it not ratified by the end of britain 's presidency term in december , the job will fall to austria , which takes over the rotating presidency on jan .

when he died , in 1982 , he left susanne , her younger brother stefan , and his third wife johanna quandt his bmw holdings and other assets . in addition to a 12.5-percent bmw stake , susanne got a controlling share in altana , one of europe 's most successful pharmaceutical and chemical concerns .
herbert quandt also left vast sums to the children from his first two marriages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan quandt is not quite as rich as his sister today , klatten is valued at around $ 9 billion -lrb- 7.8 billion euros -rrb- , which leaves her in fourth place on a list of the richest germans , as published in october by manager magazine .
her brother stefan quandt , worth $ 6.7 billion , is number 11 on that list .
while very private , the handsome 38-year-old billionaire often makes " germany 's most eligible bachelors " lists . comi n g up the ra n ks klatten 's mother , johanna , was herbert quandt 's longtime secretary and his third and last wife .
she has a fortune estimated at $ 5.4 billion .
on the roster of the world 's wealthiest women , klatten places eighth and johanna quandt places tenth . after she finished high school , susanne klatten studied business and economics in frankfurt and later earned an mba from the imd business school in lausanne , switzerland .
but much of what she learned was through the on-the-job training she got in a series of internships inside her family 's empire .
she held these positions under assumed names - understandable for someone who wants to be taken on her own terms . at the bmw factory in regensburg , quandt did a traineeship under the name susanne kant .
there she met the engineer jan klatten , who knew nothing of her extreme wealth . " i wanted to find out if he really loved me , " she is quoted as saying .
the pair married in 1990 . extreme wealth , extreme privacy klatten leads an exceptionally private life , is almost never interviewed and rarely seen in public .
the desire for privacy may be attributed to a near-miss kidnapping attempt on susanne when she was 16 . when she is out in public , observers often comment that klatten , a pretty woman with short hair and a wide smile , dresses in an elegant but low-key style .
very little is known of her personal life , except that she , her husband , and three children live in munich .
she has only given a single interview in her career , to quandt biographer rüdiger jungbluth .
according to bild tabloid , she told jungbluth her life is " multi-faceted . " from 1989 to 1990 , klatten worked as management board assistant at the hubert burda media concern .
after further study in boston , she began taking seats on various corporate boards .
in 1993 she joined the board of altana and is credited with helping transform the company into a world-class corporation , with $ 4 billion in revenue in 2004 . joi n i n g the bmw board in 1997 she and her brother assumed her mother 's place on the bmw board ; today she concentrates her energies almost exclusively on bmw .
as a member of the board there , klatten helped the company engineer the controversial 2000 buyback of rover .
when bmw consequently hit the skids , she oversaw the removal of bmw ceo bernd pischetsrieder . during world war ii , bmw 's fortunes boomed largely on the back of forced labor ; prisoners were often made to work in miserable conditions .
today , quandt foundations give money to charities for former forced laborers and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johanna quandt is the world 's 10th-richest woman susanne and her brother stefan will one day inherit the bmw shares of their mother , who is turning 80 next year .
they have made it their goal to secure bmw 's independence over the long term .
long ago their father saved the company from bankruptcy , and the heirs clearly feel an obligation .
bmw has developed superbly with the quandt family at its helm . " we are n't keeping our stake for the sake of our egos , " klatten once said , according to the magazine stern .
" we keep things peaceful , and people like that .

germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .
juxtaposed to the pictures of german expellees are images taken in refugee camps in afghanistan and africa and central america . the exhibitio n ru n s u n til april 17 , 2006 . gaby reucher -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery .

a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .

its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .

a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .
here 's a short summary of the main highlights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .
here 's a short summary of the main highlights .

the deal came a day after an agreement that could see some airbus aircraft built in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president chirac welcomed chinese prime minister wen jiabao china is buying 150 a320 aircraft , the mid-range , 150-seat work horse of the airbus fleet . rivalry with boeing airbus is 80-percent owned by the european aeronautic , defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and 20 percent by britain 's bae systems .
it is very keen to improve its share of the civil aviation market in china , one of the world 's fastest growing regions . it currently has one-third of the market , with its us rival boeing holding some 60 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .
here 's a short summary of the main highlights .
-lrb- sept .
19 , 2005 -rrb- merkel : union will occupy the chancellery angela merkel appeared before the world 's media on monday in her first press conference as chancellor-designate and spoke of the coming grand coalition government as a " coalition of new possibilities . "

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .

dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .

the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .

a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in .

her brother and mother are n't struggling , either . susanne klatten , a 43-year-old mother of three , got her wealth the old-fashioned way : she inherited it .
her father was the legendary industrialist herbert quandt , the man who made bmw the luxury-car colossus it is today .
when he died , in 1982 , he left susanne , her younger brother stefan , and his third wife johanna quandt his bmw holdings and other assets . in addition to a 12.5-percent bmw stake , susanne got a controlling share in altana , one of europe 's most successful pharmaceutical and chemical concerns .
herbert quandt also left vast sums to the children from his first two marriages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan quandt is not quite as rich as his sister today , klatten is valued at around $ 9 billion -lrb- 7.8 billion euros -rrb- , which leaves her in fourth place on a list of the richest germans , as published in october by manager magazine .
her brother stefan quandt , worth $ 6.7 billion , is number 11 on that list .
while very private , the handsome 38-year-old billionaire often makes " germany 's most eligible bachelors " lists . comi n g up the ra n ks klatten 's mother , johanna , was herbert quandt 's longtime secretary and his third and last wife .
she has a fortune estimated at $ 5.4 billion .
on the roster of the world 's wealthiest women , klatten places eighth and johanna quandt places tenth . after she finished high school , susanne klatten studied business and economics in frankfurt and later earned an mba from the imd business school in lausanne , switzerland .
but much of what she learned was through the on-the-job training she got in a series of internships inside her family 's empire .
she held these positions under assumed names - understandable for someone who wants to be taken on her own terms . at the bmw factory in regensburg , quandt did a traineeship under the name susanne kant .
there she met the engineer jan klatten , who knew nothing of her extreme wealth . " i wanted to find out if he really loved me , " she is quoted as saying .
the pair married in 1990 . extreme wealth , extreme privacy klatten leads an exceptionally private life , is almost never interviewed and rarely seen in public .
the desire for privacy may be attributed to a near-miss kidnapping attempt on susanne when she was 16 . when she is out in public , observers often comment that klatten , a pretty woman with short hair and a wide smile , dresses in an elegant but low-key style .
very little is known of her personal life , except that she , her husband , and three children live in munich .
she has only given a single interview in her career , to quandt biographer rüdiger jungbluth .
according to bild tabloid , she told jungbluth her life is " multi-faceted . " from 1989 to 1990 , klatten worked as management board assistant at the hubert burda media concern .
after further study in boston , she began taking seats on various corporate boards .
in 1993 she joined the board of altana and is credited with helping transform the company into a world-class corporation , with $ 4 billion in revenue in 2004 . joi n i n g the bmw board in 1997 she and her brother assumed her mother 's place on the bmw board ; today she concentrates her energies almost exclusively on bmw .
as a member of the board there , klatten helped the company engineer the controversial 2000 buyback of rover .
when bmw consequently hit the skids , she oversaw the removal of bmw ceo bernd pischetsrieder . during world war ii , bmw 's fortunes boomed largely on the back of forced labor ; prisoners were often made to work in miserable conditions .
today , quandt foundations give money to charities for former forced laborers and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johanna quandt is the world 's 10th-richest woman susanne and her brother stefan will one day inherit the bmw shares of their mother , who is turning 80 next year .
they have made it their goal to secure bmw 's independence over the long term .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .
another entry praised the " courage " of the youth group to produce something like this in " straitlaced bavaria . " church reactions the pastor of the church where the youth group is based does n't understand all the fuss , saying he finds it admirable " that young people are getting involved with bible history . "
the fierceness of the criticism shows , in his opinion , " how far removed many adults are from the reality of young people 's lives , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . while the bavarian protestant church had provided no official comment on the matter , the region 's catholic archdiocese is very clear where it stands on the matter . " it 's not ok to pose naked in a church , " winfried röhmel , spokesman for the archbishop of munich , friedrich wetter , told der spiegel .

boeing secured a chinese deal for 70 of its mid-range 737s last month . airbus and boeing forecast china will be buying between 1,800 and 2,700 planes over the next two decades to keep up with the surge in air travel that is expected to make the country the second-biggest customer for aircraft after the united states . looking to manufacture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa uses this ' work horse ' airbus a320 for pilot training china , though , is not content to merely be on the buying end of the industry - it also wants major western companies to set up shop on its soil , with their technology , and show chinese workers how to make their complex products . to that end , on sunday wen oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding between airbus chief gustav humbert and the national development and reform commission of china as he kicked off his european tour with a visit to airbus 's headquarters in toulouse , southwestern france . the document called for " a further upgrade of the cooperation " between china 's civil aviation industry and airbus , and included the " possibility " of building an assembly plant for mid-range airbus planes in china .
so far , only france and germany have such plants . ' two-way street ' humbert said the memorandum set the scene for the expected plane order on monday , saying that was " the other part of this two-way street : to have more contracts , to have more aircraft flying in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.12.2005 british eu budget proposal shot down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso -lrb- r . -rrb- is none too happy with blair 's newest budget proposal the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .
15-16 brussels summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- l . -rrb- and tony blair will likely meet in order to avoid another budget fiasco if the budget it not ratified by the end of britain 's presidency term in december , the job will fall to austria , which takes over the rotating presidency on jan .

22 , should tell the legislature what he knew about the abduction . " we will question the government on this and push for a clarification , " beck said . according to a report published by the washi n gto n post - and contrary to berlin 's claims - the former german government had been informed about at least one case of a cia abduction of a terror suspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane that was allegedly used for transporting terror suspects in may last year , daniel coats , the then united states ambassador in berlin , told schily that khaled el-masri - a german citizen - had been wrongfully held by the cia but would soon be released , according to the report . el-masri was abducted by the american intelligence agency in 2003 and spent 5 months in a prison in afghanistan . german public prosecutors such as eberhard beyer have started to look into the case of khaled el-masri , issuing arrest warrants against 22 people allegedly involved in the abduction . " these agents were operating on german soil which automatically means they committed their crimes under german jurisdiction , " beyer said .
" that is why we 've started legal investigations on grounds of coercion and deprivation of liberty rights . " schily , a social democrat , has so far not commented on the case .

the united states airbase in frankfurt allegedly was the hub of clandestine cia operations , which have triggered a public outcry in europe . but erler said it was n't clear whether such information would become available during us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit to berlin late monday and tuesday . hadley de n ies allegatio n s in an interview for cnn on sunday , us national security advisor stephen hadley gave a first impression of the type of answer europeans can expect .

we need to cooperate together to deal with this terrorist threat .

he also said he may leave the team even if they lift the trophy in front of a home crowd . not yet ready to write off his team 's chances at winning next summer 's tournament in front of thousands of ecstatic german fans , klinsmann admitted germany is n't his top pick . " i think it will be possible for germany to win the world cup but we need luck , a lot of luck , " he said .
" the south americans are very strong , and i see brazil and argentina as the favorites . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto carlos , ronaldinho and adriano , left to right , are favorites again in 2006 even if he seems to lack a bit of self-confidence , klinsmann still has not backed away from his goal of winning the title . the extra spark that comes from playing on home turf can often push a team to unexpected highs .
in the last world cup the home field advantage helped underdog south korea into the semifinals . home turf n ot a guara n tee " it helped a favorite like france win the title in 1998 , and we also profited from it when we were the champions in 1974 , " said german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , who captained the 1974 german side .
" i find it courageous and correct that jürgen klinsmann has such a goal for his team . " despite the " kaiser 's " words of praise , hosting the world cup does n't necessarily translate to success : of the 17 finals so far , only seven have gone to the host nation . germa n y side struggles with youth sympathetic fans might be enough to perk up the german team after a series of lackluster friendly matches .
their best play came during last summer 's confederations cup , where the home fans were treated to a german side that scored a tournament high of 15 goals and finished third , tying argentina and losing to brazil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's younger players had much to celebrate during the confederations cup much like during the confederations cup , klinsmann has fielded young teams for germany 's most international matches .
he said it 's the team 's youth that keep them from claiming international glory . " we have a very , very young team , but our players are learning and getting better , " klinsmann said .
" they need more time to develop , and i think that in four or five years we 'll have a really strong team . " kli n sma n n 's future still u n clear klinsmann , however , has left a question mark on whether he 'll be around to guide a more experienced team .
his contract is set to expire after the 2006 finals , which run from june 9 to july 9 , and he has said he would n't commit to a new deal until after the tournament . " even if we are crowned world champions that alone will not decide my future with the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , " klinsmann informed the weekly die zeit newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann , in red , spent much of his time integrating new players into the team klinsmann , 41 , took over from rudi völler after germany 's disastrous performance during the euro 2004 finals .
dfb chiefs were so impressed by his work they wanted to discuss a contract extension before the finals to ensure a period of stability . since the departure of berti vogts in 1998 , the german team has had three different managers with erich ribbeck sacked after a nightmare euro 2000 and völler resigning after euro 2004 . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de clear world cup favorites yet to emerge seven months before the world cup gets underway , the pressure is already rising for some teams to put on a good show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

22 , should tell the legislature what he knew about the abduction . " we will question the government on this and push for a clarification , " beck said . according to a report published by the washi n gto n post - and contrary to berlin 's claims - the former german government had been informed about at least one case of a cia abduction of a terror suspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane that was allegedly used for transporting terror suspects in may last year , daniel coats , the then united states ambassador in berlin , told schily that khaled el-masri - a german citizen - had been wrongfully held by the cia but would soon be released , according to the report . el-masri was abducted by the american intelligence agency in 2003 and spent 5 months in a prison in afghanistan . german public prosecutors such as eberhard beyer have started to look into the case of khaled el-masri , issuing arrest warrants against 22 people allegedly involved in the abduction . " these agents were operating on german soil which automatically means they committed their crimes under german jurisdiction , " beyer said .
" that is why we 've started legal investigations on grounds of coercion and deprivation of liberty rights . " schily , a social democrat , has so far not commented on the case .
a spokeswoman for the interior ministry , which is now led by conservative wolfgang schäuble , said she could not speak for the previous regime . will rice talk i n berli n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler deputy foreign minister gernot erler -lrb- spd -rrb- said he understood that governments do not want to reveal details about the fight against terror , but added that the public has a right to " at least know what the legal situation was and whether national and international laws were adhered to . " in an interview with public broadcaster rbb , erler added that expected us officials to inform their german counterparts about allegations regarding secret cia flights transporting terror suspects across german air space .
the united states airbase in frankfurt allegedly was the hub of clandestine cia operations , which have triggered a public outcry in europe . but erler said it was n't clear whether such information would become available during us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit to berlin late monday and tuesday . hadley de n ies allegatio n s in an interview for cnn on sunday , us national security advisor stephen hadley gave a first impression of the type of answer europeans can expect . " the terrorists threaten all of us , " he said .
" this is a threat really to the civilized world .
we need to cooperate together to deal with this terrorist threat .
that cooperation is characterized by three things : one , we comply with us constitution , us laws and us treaty obligations .
secondly , we respect the sovereignty of those countries with whom we are cooperating , and three - we do not move people around the world so that they can be tortured . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with bush in february in mainz , germany german chancellor angela merkel , who is trying to get german-us relations back on a more friendly footing , has said that she believes the americans will clear up the case . " the new german government will do everything in its power to work for close , genuine and trusting relations with the united states , " she said .
" that 's why i 'm also fully convinced that the american administration will do everything to dispel european concern and clear up allegations of illegal cia activities as quickly as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .
juxtaposed to the pictures of german expellees are images taken in refugee camps in afghanistan and africa and central america . the exhibitio n ru n s u n til april 17 , 2006 . gaby reucher -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new chancellor gives new hope to german expellees a controversial center aiming to acknowledge the postwar plight of german expellees could be closer to reality since angela merkel took over the chancellery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .
here 's a short summary of the main highlights .

he also said he may leave the team even if they lift the trophy in front of a home crowd . not yet ready to write off his team 's chances at winning next summer 's tournament in front of thousands of ecstatic german fans , klinsmann admitted germany is n't his top pick .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roberto carlos , ronaldinho and adriano , left to right , are favorites again in 2006 even if he seems to lack a bit of self-confidence , klinsmann still has not backed away from his goal of winning the title . the extra spark that comes from playing on home turf can often push a team to unexpected highs .

22 , should tell the legislature what he knew about the abduction . " we will question the government on this and push for a clarification , " beck said . according to a report published by the washi n gto n post - and contrary to berlin 's claims - the former german government had been informed about at least one case of a cia abduction of a terror suspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane that was allegedly used for transporting terror suspects in may last year , daniel coats , the then united states ambassador in berlin , told schily that khaled el-masri - a german citizen - had been wrongfully held by the cia but would soon be released , according to the report . el-masri was abducted by the american intelligence agency in 2003 and spent 5 months in a prison in afghanistan . german public prosecutors such as eberhard beyer have started to look into the case of khaled el-masri , issuing arrest warrants against 22 people allegedly involved in the abduction . " these agents were operating on german soil which automatically means they committed their crimes under german jurisdiction , " beyer said .
" that is why we 've started legal investigations on grounds of coercion and deprivation of liberty rights . " schily , a social democrat , has so far not commented on the case .
a spokeswoman for the interior ministry , which is now led by conservative wolfgang schäuble , said she could not speak for the previous regime . will rice talk i n berli n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gernot erler deputy foreign minister gernot erler -lrb- spd -rrb- said he understood that governments do not want to reveal details about the fight against terror , but added that the public has a right to " at least know what the legal situation was and whether national and international laws were adhered to . " in an interview with public broadcaster rbb , erler added that expected us officials to inform their german counterparts about allegations regarding secret cia flights transporting terror suspects across german air space .
the united states airbase in frankfurt allegedly was the hub of clandestine cia operations , which have triggered a public outcry in europe . but erler said it was n't clear whether such information would become available during us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit to berlin late monday and tuesday . hadley de n ies allegatio n s in an interview for cnn on sunday , us national security advisor stephen hadley gave a first impression of the type of answer europeans can expect . " the terrorists threaten all of us , " he said .
" this is a threat really to the civilized world .
we need to cooperate together to deal with this terrorist threat .
that cooperation is characterized by three things : one , we comply with us constitution , us laws and us treaty obligations .
secondly , we respect the sovereignty of those countries with whom we are cooperating , and three - we do not move people around the world so that they can be tortured . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with bush in february in mainz , germany german chancellor angela merkel , who is trying to get german-us relations back on a more friendly footing , has said that she believes the americans will clear up the case . " the new german government will do everything in its power to work for close , genuine and trusting relations with the united states , " she said .
" that 's why i 'm also fully convinced that the american administration will do everything to dispel european concern and clear up allegations of illegal cia activities as quickly as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.12.2005 british eu budget proposal shot down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso -lrb- r . -rrb- is none too happy with blair 's newest budget proposal the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .
15-16 brussels summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac -lrb- l . -rrb- and tony blair will likely meet in order to avoid another budget fiasco if the budget it not ratified by the end of britain 's presidency term in december , the job will fall to austria , which takes over the rotating presidency on jan .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said he was n't sure the eu would reach a compromise on the budget at all this year . german finance minister peer steinbrück is demanding a reduction in the fees paid by wealthier nations like germany , the netherlands and sweden . later this week , blair plans to hold talks with no fewer than eight fellow eu leaders , in an effort to break the deadlock .
in meetings on thursday and friday , blair will meet with prime ministers of portugal , finland , slovenia , sweden , the netherlands , ireland , greece and spain . chirac and blair will meet a spokesman for blair did not rule out discussions with other eu leaders , notably french president jacques chirac , in the run-up to the dec .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.12.2005 british eu budget proposal shot down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso -lrb- r . -rrb- is none too happy with blair 's newest budget proposal the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .

her brother and mother are n't struggling , either . susanne klatten , a 43-year-old mother of three , got her wealth the old-fashioned way : she inherited it .
her father was the legendary industrialist herbert quandt , the man who made bmw the luxury-car colossus it is today .
when he died , in 1982 , he left susanne , her younger brother stefan , and his third wife johanna quandt his bmw holdings and other assets . in addition to a 12.5-percent bmw stake , susanne got a controlling share in altana , one of europe 's most successful pharmaceutical and chemical concerns .
herbert quandt also left vast sums to the children from his first two marriages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan quandt is not quite as rich as his sister today , klatten is valued at around $ 9 billion -lrb- 7.8 billion euros -rrb- , which leaves her in fourth place on a list of the richest germans , as published in october by manager magazine .
her brother stefan quandt , worth $ 6.7 billion , is number 11 on that list .
while very private , the handsome 38-year-old billionaire often makes " germany 's most eligible bachelors " lists . comi n g up the ra n ks klatten 's mother , johanna , was herbert quandt 's longtime secretary and his third and last wife .
she has a fortune estimated at $ 5.4 billion .
on the roster of the world 's wealthiest women , klatten places eighth and johanna quandt places tenth . after she finished high school , susanne klatten studied business and economics in frankfurt and later earned an mba from the imd business school in lausanne , switzerland .
but much of what she learned was through the on-the-job training she got in a series of internships inside her family 's empire .
she held these positions under assumed names - understandable for someone who wants to be taken on her own terms . at the bmw factory in regensburg , quandt did a traineeship under the name susanne kant .
there she met the engineer jan klatten , who knew nothing of her extreme wealth . " i wanted to find out if he really loved me , " she is quoted as saying .
the pair married in 1990 . extreme wealth , extreme privacy klatten leads an exceptionally private life , is almost never interviewed and rarely seen in public .
the desire for privacy may be attributed to a near-miss kidnapping attempt on susanne when she was 16 . when she is out in public , observers often comment that klatten , a pretty woman with short hair and a wide smile , dresses in an elegant but low-key style .
very little is known of her personal life , except that she , her husband , and three children live in munich .
she has only given a single interview in her career , to quandt biographer rüdiger jungbluth .
according to bild tabloid , she told jungbluth her life is " multi-faceted . " from 1989 to 1990 , klatten worked as management board assistant at the hubert burda media concern .
after further study in boston , she began taking seats on various corporate boards .
in 1993 she joined the board of altana and is credited with helping transform the company into a world-class corporation , with $ 4 billion in revenue in 2004 . joi n i n g the bmw board in 1997 she and her brother assumed her mother 's place on the bmw board ; today she concentrates her energies almost exclusively on bmw .
as a member of the board there , klatten helped the company engineer the controversial 2000 buyback of rover .
when bmw consequently hit the skids , she oversaw the removal of bmw ceo bernd pischetsrieder . during world war ii , bmw 's fortunes boomed largely on the back of forced labor ; prisoners were often made to work in miserable conditions .
today , quandt foundations give money to charities for former forced laborers and their families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johanna quandt is the world 's 10th-richest woman susanne and her brother stefan will one day inherit the bmw shares of their mother , who is turning 80 next year .
they have made it their goal to secure bmw 's independence over the long term .
long ago their father saved the company from bankruptcy , and the heirs clearly feel an obligation .
bmw has developed superbly with the quandt family at its helm . " we are n't keeping our stake for the sake of our egos , " klatten once said , according to the magazine stern .
" we keep things peaceful , and people like that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.12.2005 explaining the expellee experience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees arriving from poland in germany in 1950 after world war ii , germans were expelled from eastern europe and sent to a divided germany .
a new exhibition in bonn recounts their stories and lets expellees share their memories . emma schukies clearly remembers her flight from lithuania . " i came down the entire baltic sea coastline , " she recounted in a video documentary that forms part of the new exhibition in bonn .
" for 14 days , i traveled by train or car - sometimes soldiers gave me a ride . " schukies is one of about 12 million people , who had to leave their homeland after world war ii .
their fate is now the focus of an exhibition called " flight , expulsion , integration " at bonn 's house of history . the timing could n't be better .
just last week , chancellor angela merkel traveled to poland to stress the positive working relationship with germany 's neighbor following heated discussions over establishing a center for german expellees .
the exhibit is part of a nation-wide effort to raise awareness - both at home and abroad - of the fate of millions of refugees in the aftermath of world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chest used by expellees to transport personal goods the show , which is designed to travel to berlin and leipzig after bonn , opens by presenting the sheer dimension of the post-war expulsions - the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
pictures and slides show people traveling on foot while carrying their luggage on their backs or being transported in crowded trains . while the first part of the exhibition looks at their journey across europe from the furthest corners of eastern europe - poland , the czech republic , romania , ukraine and russia to various relocation centers in east and west germany - the main area of the exhibition tells the story of arrival in their new home .
to help " experience " the situation , museum visitors enter a former barrack where expellees were housed .
its primative outfittings consisting of a wooden bed , closet and a simple stove make vivid the hardship the refugees faced upon arriving in germany . pictures also help to document life in the expellee camps ; and items such as a communion dress made out of gauze bandages give an idea of how people desperately clung to tradition during times of need . east vs. west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees were called " umsiedler , " or re-settlers , in east germany the exhibit also draws attention to the contrasting plight of expellees in the east and west .
in communist east germany , expellees , who were called " re-settlers " in an effort to de-politize the nature of their plight , found it impossible to keep memories of their fate alive , said petra wohlfahrt , who works at the museum .
the government avoided addressing the contentious issue and liturature and other art that looked critically at the subject was shunned . only after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989 were researchers able to retrace these stories .
" people breathed a sigh of relief in the former east germany , because they were finally able to talk about it again , " she explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " divided into three ?
never ! " reads the poster in west germany , expellee associations , such as those representing sudeten germans and volga germans , formed much earlier and continue to voice their political demands to this day . the exhibition tries to look at this complicated situation from different angles .
while conflicts between various groups usually make headlines , the exhibition 's organizers were trying to focus on cooperations instead , said hans-joachim westholt , who curated the show . questio n s about the prese nt but the exhibition does not only recount the past .
it also includes present-day documents , such as posters advertising literary competitions around expellee topics or plays that deal with the issue . videos like the one with schukies also help to give visitors a more concrete idea of the expulsion experience . " you can ' ask ' witnesses about various things such as their origin , their past , their departure , flight and expulsion , " westholt said .
" these people accompany you during your visit and you can enter the present with them , asking them things like how they discuss their history with their grandchildren and how they feel about it today . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese refugees waiting for food the exhibition also makes clear that expulsions did n't end in 1945 and are not exclusive to post-war europe .

22 , should tell the legislature what he knew about the abduction . " we will question the government on this and push for a clarification , " beck said . according to a report published by the washi n gto n post - and contrary to berlin 's claims - the former german government had been informed about at least one case of a cia abduction of a terror suspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cia plane that was allegedly used for transporting terror suspects in may last year , daniel coats , the then united states ambassador in berlin , told schily that khaled el-masri - a german citizen - had been wrongfully held by the cia but would soon be released , according to the report . el-masri was abducted by the american intelligence agency in 2003 and spent 5 months in a prison in afghanistan . german public prosecutors such as eberhard beyer have started to look into the case of khaled el-masri , issuing arrest warrants against 22 people allegedly involved in the abduction . " these agents were operating on german soil which automatically means they committed their crimes under german jurisdiction , " beyer said .
" that is why we 've started legal investigations on grounds of coercion and deprivation of liberty rights . " schily , a social democrat , has so far not commented on the case .

" in an interview with public broadcaster rbb , erler added that expected us officials to inform their german counterparts about allegations regarding secret cia flights transporting terror suspects across german air space .
the united states airbase in frankfurt allegedly was the hub of clandestine cia operations , which have triggered a public outcry in europe . but erler said it was n't clear whether such information would become available during us secretary of state condoleezza rice 's visit to berlin late monday and tuesday . hadley de n ies allegatio n s in an interview for cnn on sunday , us national security advisor stephen hadley gave a first impression of the type of answer europeans can expect . " the terrorists threaten all of us , " he said .
" this is a threat really to the civilized world .
we need to cooperate together to deal with this terrorist threat .
that cooperation is characterized by three things : one , we comply with us constitution , us laws and us treaty obligations .
secondly , we respect the sovereignty of those countries with whom we are cooperating , and three - we do not move people around the world so that they can be tortured . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with bush in february in mainz , germany german chancellor angela merkel , who is trying to get german-us relations back on a more friendly footing , has said that she believes the americans will clear up the case . " the new german government will do everything in its power to work for close , genuine and trusting relations with the united states , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2005 cdu analyzes election disaster , shifts tone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was some fingerpointing going on after the election on monday , the conservatives took stock of their poor performance in this fall 's elections .
they admitted mistakes that led to their third-worst result ever , but spared party leader and new chancellor angela merkel . the conservative cdu said it was eager to examine why what was widely expected to be a sure-fire victory on sept .
18 turned into a near debacle .
they only garnered 35.2 percent of the popular vote and narrowly edged out gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the same time , they were intent on avoiding a public bout of self-flagellation that could have weakened their party and merkel , germany 's new chancellor as of nov .
22 . " the cdu and csu fell well short of their goal in the election because they talked too much about flat tax and too little about people , " jürgen rüttgers , the powerful cdu premier of north rhine-westphalia , said in a column in the german daily die welt on monday .
just months before the election , the conservatives had held a 20-point lead over the spd and some opinion polls suggested they would win enough votes to control parliament on their own .
but a series of missteps came soon thereafter , the biggest of which may have been merkel 's naming of academic paul kirchhof , an advocate of a 25 percent flat tax , as her designated finance minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder made kirchhof the focus of a late campaign drive , whipping up public fears that " the professor from heidelberg " would soak the working class to cut taxes for the rich . in the end , merkel 's conservatives beat the spd by just one percentage point and had to abandon their preferred plans of forming a coalition with the free-market liberals , the fdp .
they had no choice but to forge a " grand coalition " with the spd . no vision peter müller , the premier of the state of saarland , said the party had to forge a closer connection to the people .
he said the campaign had been too technocratic and had lacked a larger vision that voters could relate to . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little softer , a little more cheerful some senior members of the party are clamoring for a makeover that would give the party a more caring image and a less reform-focused message , and show that they have an overarching strategy on where the country should be headed , not just ideas about tinkering with tax rates and subsidies . but the cdu members meeting on monday did not blame merkel , who is facing a host of foreign policy challenges in her first weeks , including the kidnapping of a german in iraq and tuesday 's politically sensitive visit by us secretary of state condoleezza rice . in exchange for treading softer , the party leadership appears to have won her support for a wholesale shift in tone that brings the cdu much closer to its centre-left coalition partners the spd and , the party hopes , to german voters . " angela merkel wants to shed the image of the cold cdu reformer and present herself as the chancellor for all germans - partly to counter the internal criticism of her miserable election result , " the german weekly der spiegel wrote on sunday . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election night highlights as the results began pouring in on election night , dw-world followed the ups and downs and the early stages of coalition negotiations in a live ticker .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in . " some people may ask for a ban on foreign vehicles to launch satellites , " rachel villain , the director of space and communications and the paris-based euroconsult agency , told the bbc . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's venus express takes off europe 's first mission to venus was successfully launched wednesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan and emitted a first signal at the start of its 163-day journey to the turbulent planet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.12.2005 british eu budget proposal shot down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose barroso -lrb- r . -rrb- is none too happy with blair 's newest budget proposal the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .

the reaction was anything but warm . britain on monday put forth an eu budget proposal that signalled willingness to compromise on its controversial rebate if the organization 's newest members would agree to less development aid .
the 846.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 998 billion -rrb- spending blueprint outlined by foreign minister jack straw , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , was 24.2 billion euros less than the budget proposed by previous president luxembourg . the u.k. suggested cutting aid to the eu 's ten new members in eastern and southern europe by 14 billion euros over seven years and stood firm on its demand that the eu 's generous agricultural subsidy system be revamped . though not willing to completely eliminate the eu budget rebate it negotiated it for itself when it was a poor nation in 1984 , britain offered either to pay more into the budget or to get back less , without giving figures .
" these proposals ensure that there can be no fundamental change in the rebate without fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy , " straw said . eu commission president jose manuel barroso shot down the british proposal later in the day , calling it " simply not realistic " .
barroso said it was unfair to the new , and substantially poorer , member states in eastern europe . " the proposal needs to become fairer for the new member states , " he said . budget talks failed in june the eu budget for 2007 to 2013 ought to have been finalized at a summit in june , but the meeting broke up after a bitter dispute between britain and france .
london had refused to surrender its rebate while paris opposed the british plan to reform the eu 's farm subsidy system , of which it is the major beneficiary . blair had tried to force france to accept fundamental reforms to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- - which takes up 42 percent of eu spending - in return for a renegotiation of the rebate .
france reaps the most from eu farm subsidies while britain enjoys an eu rebate - amounting to 5.3 billion euros in 2004 - to compensate for the little it draws from the cap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current agricultural policy is a boon to french farmers outlook for compromise grim leaders hope to find a way out of this dead-end situation at an eu summit planned dec 15 to the 16th in brussels , but those interviewed sounded less than hopeful . britain 's eu minister , douglas alexander , said he saw no way to bridge the gap between the eu 's net givers and net receivers .

one church group has decided change all that by spicing up the bible stories in a monthly format . in one picture , dark-haired delilah is about to cut the hair of a sleeping samson .
just under the pair of scissors she has poised near a lock of samson 's hair , her naked left breast is clearly visible .
another photograph depicts eve holding out an apple to the viewer .
she stands in the aisle of a church , the altar visible in the background , wearing nothing but her long flowing hair and a strategically placed fig leaf . those are just two of the photographs in the new erotic calendar that went on sale this past weekend in a protestant church in nuremberg .
others depict the baptism of jesus , lot 's daughters , the dance of salome and the sacrifice of isaac . the calendar is a project of the church 's youth group , which said on a web site that its goal is to bring the stories of the bible closer to today 's people by putting them in a contemporary context .
each of the photographs is accompanied by a theological text explaining the story depicted . the youth group members also wanted to bring in a little cash .
due to budget cuts , the financing of many of the group 's activities is in danger .
members hope that the calendars , which they 're selling at 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 14.66 -rrb- a piece , can help fill up empty coffers . gone too far ? but for some , having naked people posing in a house of god is beyond the pale .
a wave of protest broke out on the comments page of the calendar 's website before it was taken down . " what you are doing is uncivilized !
this is a church , " wrote one anonymous critic .
" i find it shameless to abuse the bible as a motive for nude photos , " said another .
" confess your sin and leave it behind . " others , however , threw their support behind the controversial project .
" finally , a little pep in a protestant church , " wrote one admirer .
another entry praised the " courage " of the youth group to produce something like this in " straitlaced bavaria . " church reactions the pastor of the church where the youth group is based does n't understand all the fuss , saying he finds it admirable " that young people are getting involved with bible history . "
the fierceness of the criticism shows , in his opinion , " how far removed many adults are from the reality of young people 's lives , " he told the newsmagazine der spiegel . while the bavarian protestant church had provided no official comment on the matter , the region 's catholic archdiocese is very clear where it stands on the matter . " it 's not ok to pose naked in a church , " winfried röhmel , spokesman for the archbishop of munich , friedrich wetter , told der spiegel .

the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- gathers in berlin monday to talk about the focus of european space exploration in coming years .
germany 's space lobby meanwhile wants more government money . esa 's ministerial meeting will be headed by german economics minister michael glos , who currently heads the body . " this high-tech sector is important for germany and europe , " glos said ahead of the talks , adding that space exploration was an important economic factor and had clear benefits for people such as helping with protection against catastrophes and monitoring climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael glos glos will be closely watched by germany 's space lobby , which is hoping that the new government of christian democrats and social democrats will increase germany 's financial contribution both to the european and german space sectors . hans-joachim gante , the executive director of the federal association of german air and space industries , said the government should increase its annual contribution to esa by 50 million euros -lrb- $ 58.5 million -rrb- to 600 million euros and add another 50 million to national space programs , which would then come to 200 million euros . " this is the only way to prevent the downfall of germany 's space industry , " gante told journalists , adding that he hoped the country would now be governed by a " rocket chancelloress " angela merkel after " car chancellor " gerhard schröder . however , german representatives are likely to tell other esa member countries that berlin contributes too much while the country 's space industry is not considered enough for contracts .
" the principle of recycling the money back into the industry has got skewed , " said matthias gründer of flugrevue magazine .
" germany is paying more into esa than it is getting in the way of contracts . " billio n s for n ew programs at the berlin meeting , glos and his colleagues will focus on the basic direction esa is meant to take in coming years . esa officials are asking member states , which include 17 european nations and canada , to contribute 8.8 billion euros for programs , according to a bbc report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans dream of sending someone to the moon some of the programs under discussion are the so-called exomars mission , which would take off in 2011 and put a lander on the planet ; preparation programs for later manned missions to the moon and mars ; more funding for a satellite program that monitors the state of earth ; and the so-called global monitoring for environment and security -lrb- gmes -rrb- program . rockets used in space programs such as those used for launching satellites are also expected to become a hotly contested issue during the meeting , with germany , france and italy pushing for ariane 5 and new vega rockets , which they have invested in .

the violence , which lasted less than three weeks , was not regarded as a religious intifada .
but the anger that fuelled it is also driving a rise of muslim militancy in french ghettos .
take venissieux - a town that is only a short ride away from lyon but feels like another country .
the venissieux market could be mistaken for a middle eastern bazaar .
arabic is spoken everywhere .
stalls offer copies of the koran .
men in white robes collect money for new mosques .
the town 's foreign appearance has added to its rotten reputation .
taxis refuse to come here .
the overwhelming majority of residents are law-abiding citizens .
but because of the radical few among them the place is widely seen as a den of islamic extremism . "
they are told they are french but they are not given the same rights as the french - necessarily some become radicals " farid khelifi abdelkader bouziane , a fundamentalist imam recently expelled to algeria , preached in venissieux .
two of the seven frenchmen once held at the guantanamo base also came from here .
although france opposed the iraq war , police are under no illusion that the country is immune from the worldwide jihad .
they say venissieux and hundreds of similar immigrant suburbs around french cities are fertile ground for al-qaeda .
" muslim extremists have in recent years deeply penetrated the suburbs , " says stephane berthomet , a former anti-terrorist investigator who now works for the synergie police union .
rude awakening france had an early wake-up call to the presence of jihadis on its soil .
in 1995 local muslims helped carry out a wave of attacks that killed eight and injured hundreds in paris .
in 2000 police uncovered a bomb plot in strasbourg during christmas festivities .
muslims in europe a week of special bbc features come back daily for more features and muslim voices not normally heard the main recruiting cause at the time was algeria 's civil war , in which paris sided with a repressive , anti-islamist government .
many argue that nowadays radicals are able to tap into the alienation felt by many ghetto youths .
" they have no jobs , no future , " says farid khelifi , a youth worker in villeurbanne , another suburb of lyon .
" they do not know who they are .
they are told they are french but they are not given the same rights as the french .
necessarily some become radicals . "
this views is shared by many - even among police .
" immigrants have been parked in estates and excluded , " says mr berthomet .
" youths ca n't see a way out of their condition and become the ideal recruits for radical preachers . "
rootless writer olivier roy , author of globalised islam , says the main problem is not so much social deprivation as lack of a clear cultural identity .
" they have been uprooted , " he says .
" they are alienated from traditional islam and their parents . "
the young men who carried out the london bombings did not view themselves as members of the pakistani community but as members of a radical muslim umma , mr roy notes .
" the same is happening in france , " he says .
no one knows exactly how many french muslims have gone down the same route .
yacine , a 17-year-old from saint-denis near paris , reckons that five " out of more than 100 kids i know " have become radical .
this percentage seems in line with estimates from police , who believe that about 50 of france 's 1,600 mosques or prayer halls are under the influence of extremists .
of course , not all radicals are prepared to take up arms .
mr roy says the number of jihadis in france could be around 1,000 .
zero tolerance the numbers may be small , mr berthomet says , but they are rising .
" youths who a while back would become criminals are now increasingly attracted to radical ideologies like salafism , " he says .
french islam second largest religion five million muslims -lrb- estimate -rrb- 1,600 places of worship 35 % algerian origin -lrb- estimate -rrb- 25 % moroccan origin -lrb- estimate -rrb- 10 % tunisian origin -lrb- estimate -rrb- concentrated in poor suburbs of paris , lille , lyon , marseille and other cities to deal with the danger , france has enacted tough anti-terror laws .
under the charge of " association related to a terrorist enterprise " , anyone with the remotest link to a suspect can be placed under lengthy preventive detention .
france has also clamped down on radical speech .
agents keeps close tabs on mosques and groups gravitating around them .
imams who step out of line are expelled .
venissieux preacher abdelkader bouziane fell foul of the authorities not for advocating violence , but for saying the koran condoned the beating of unfaithful wives .
does the zero-tolerance approach work ?
police point out that it has attracted attention from countries , like britain , who were slow in realising the domestic threat .
but many in the suburbs feel that all muslims are being placed under suspicion .
" mosques are not dens of terrorism , " says azzedine gaci , who heads the regional muslim council in lyon .
" youths are not potential bin ladens . "
staying on top ?
according to christophe deloire , author of the islamists are already here , the tough line can be self-defeating . "
in the 1970s -lsb- youths -rsb- would have joined the radical left - today they join radical islam because ... it is the main violent ideology available " olivier roy " when the government decides to expel an imam , many mainstream muslims regard this as an attack on all muslims , " he says .
olivier roy argues that the government is wrong to regard the global jihad primarily as a religious phenomenon .
some disaffected youths , he says , are attracted to al-qaeda simply because of its fighting image .
" in the 1970s they would have joined the radical left .
today they join radical islam , both because they often have muslim roots and because it is the main violent ideology available . "
if militants do not draw their force from islam itself , putting muslims under suspicion may not be the best strategy , mr roy argues .
french police , however , feel they have no option but to continue monitoring the islamic pool from which militants draw their recruits .
" in this field , either you are on top on things and then you barely manage to stop attacks , or you are not on top and then it is even harder to avert them , " mr berthomet says .

the violence , which lasted less than three weeks , was not regarded as a religious intifada .
but the anger that fuelled it is also driving a rise of muslim militancy in french ghettos .
take venissieux - a town that is only a short ride away from lyon but feels like another country .
the venissieux market could be mistaken for a middle eastern bazaar .
arabic is spoken everywhere .
stalls offer copies of the koran .
men in white robes collect money for new mosques .
the town 's foreign appearance has added to its rotten reputation .
taxis refuse to come here .
the overwhelming majority of residents are law-abiding citizens .
but because of the radical few among them the place is widely seen as a den of islamic extremism .
they are told they are french but they are not given the same rights as the french - necessarily some become radicals farid khelifi abdelkader bouziane , a fundamentalist imam recently expelled to algeria , preached in venissieux .
two of the seven frenchmen once held at the guantanamo base also came from here .
although france opposed the iraq war , police are under no illusion that the country is immune from the worldwide jihad .
they say venissieux and hundreds of similar immigrant suburbs around french cities are fertile ground for al-qaeda .
" muslim extremists have in recent years deeply penetrated the suburbs , " says stephane berthomet , a former anti-terrorist investigator who now works for the synergie police union .
rude awakening france had an early wake-up call to the presence of jihadis on its soil .
in 1995 local muslims helped carry out a wave of attacks that killed eight and injured hundreds in paris .
in 2000 police uncovered a bomb plot in strasbourg during christmas festivities .
muslims in europe a week of special bbc features come back daily for more features and muslim voices not normally heard click here for full coverage the main recruiting cause at the time was algeria 's civil war , in which paris sided with a repressive , anti-islamist government .
many argue that nowadays radicals are able to tap into the alienation felt by many ghetto youths .
" they have no jobs , no future , " says farid khelifi , a youth worker in villeurbanne , another suburb of lyon .
" they do not know who they are .
they are told they are french but they are not given the same rights as the french .
necessarily some become radicals . "
this views is shared by many - even among police .
" immigrants have been parked in estates and excluded , " says mr berthomet .
" youths ca n't see a way out of their condition and become the ideal recruits for radical preachers . "
rootless writer olivier roy , author of globalised islam , says the main problem is not so much social deprivation as lack of a clear cultural identity .
" they have been uprooted , " he says .
" they are alienated from traditional islam and their parents . "
french police frequently arrest suspected radicals in the suburbs the young men who carried out the london bombings did not view themselves as members of the pakistani community but as members of a radical muslim umma , mr roy notes .
" the same is happening in france , " he says .
no one knows exactly how many french muslims have gone down the same route .
yacine , a 17-year-old from saint-denis near paris , reckons that five " out of more than 100 kids i know " have become radical .
this percentage seems in line with estimates from police , who believe that about 50 of france 's 1,600 mosques or prayer halls are under the influence of extremists .
of course , not all radicals are prepared to take up arms .
mr roy says the number of jihadis in france could be around 1,000 .
zero tolerance the numbers may be small , mr berthomet says , but they are rising .
" youths who a while back would become criminals are now increasingly attracted to radical ideologies like salafism , " he says .

friends of the earth cymru has written to all welsh assembly members saying it should be rejected as an energy option because it is unsafe and uneconomic .
the assembly government said it did not see a commercial need for nuclear power , but welcomed " an open debate .
prime minister tony blair has launched an energy review which could pave the way for new nuclear plants .
the scottish executive has already made it clear that it would not accept new stations until the issue of waste disposal was solved .
friends of the earth cymru -lrb- foec -rrb- wants a similar declaration from the welsh assembly government .
the wag has made it clear that it supports the use of renewable energy sources , particularly wind power .
the aim is to increase the amount of energy from renewable sources by 10 % over the next five years .
a wag spokeswoman said it had recently published details of how it would continue to meet the energy needs of wales " whilst minimising the impact on the environment " .
she added : " we believe we have identified the right mix of energy sources and with substantial new energy investments coming on stream over the next three to five years we do not see a commercial need for new nuclear energy installations - quite apart from the perennial issues associated with nuclear power i.e. costs , waste and security .
" however we welcome an open debate in this important area . "
gordon james of foec said : " nuclear power has had 50 years to prove itself , but has failed to deliver economic , safe or clean energy and has left a legacy of hazardous waste and financial costs for future generations .
" it is once again being promoted as a quick-fix solution to an energy challenge , but in reality amounts to no more than an expensive fig leaf to cover the embarrassment of failed attempts to make adequate reductions in carbon dioxide emissions . "
foec argues that , within wales , nuclear power could not fill the gap left by the closure of wylfa nuclear power station in five years time .
it claims it would , take at least 10 years to build a new nuclear power station and that the gap could be filled by renewable energy sources .
alternatives include using onshore and offshore windfarms , wave power and solar power .
the environmental organisation said many other options were also available for filling this gap cost-effectively while reducing emissions of carbon dioxide .
these include new gas-fired power stations and combined heat and power -lrb- chp -rrb- systems , which use the heat normally wasted in electricity generation .
fitting the coal-fired power stations at aberthaw and uskmouth with modern technology to reduce carbon dioxide emissions was also an option , it said .

barrister grant algie told the northern territory supreme court a number of factors " do n't quite add up " .
mr murdoch , 47 , denies murdering the british backpacker and kidnapping and attacking his girlfriend , joanne lees .
mr algie said no blood was found in mr falconio 's camper van and questioned why his body was never found .
" the absence of a body is a legitimate basis for serious concern when you are asked to return a verdict of murder , " he said .
why would you possibly pick up a dead body , complete with blood presumably , and put it in your car ?
you would have to be nuts grant algie defence barrister the prosecution alleges mr murdoch killed mr falconio after flagging down the couple 's orange camper van on a remote stretch of the stuart highway , near barrow creek , about 200 miles north of alice springs on 14 july , 2001 .
but mr algie suggested his client may have been " set up " by police .
referring to mr murdoch 's dna which was found on a set of makeshift handcuffs , mr algie asked the jury : " could they have been contaminated intentionally ?
could it be to attempt , in the vernacular , a set up , a fit up ?
" is it possible that police or somebody who had access to these items could have fitted him up ? "
the court also heard that miss lees used a piece of lip balm to try to ease the handcuffs off her wrists after escaping from her attacker 's vehicle .
its lid was found under a bush , but the lip balm itself and two pieces of black tape which miss lees said she bit off the handcuffs were not found until three months later in october when police returned to the scene on an " orientation " exercise - even though they were discovered in the same place .
mr algie said : " it 's almost embarrassing to suggest that two crime scene officers in these circumstances would not have searched around the area . "
the defence lawyer said the most obvious explanation was that " somebody has played around with the evidence to make it look like the lid and the tape was there when it was not .
" or is it , as has been suggested in cross examination , that some kangaroo came along and took it away for a few months , and later brought it back - or perhaps it was a dingo ? "
mr algie concluded : " it 's yet another example of police manipulating the evidence to perhaps better the case to make it look a little better , with no harm done . "
the lawyer also said there was " absolutely no rational explanation " why anyone would kill the backpacker in such a remote spot and then move the body .
" why would you possibly pick up a dead body , complete with blood presumably , and put it in your car ?

barrister grant algie told the northern territory supreme court a number of factors " do n't quite add up " .
mr murdoch , 47 , denies murdering the british backpacker and kidnapping and attacking his girlfriend , joanne lees .
mr algie said no blood was found in mr falconio 's camper van and questioned why his body was never found .
" the absence of a body is a legitimate basis for serious concern when you are asked to return a verdict of murder , " he said .
why would you possibly pick up a dead body , complete with blood presumably , and put it in your car ?
you would have to be nuts grant algie defence barrister the prosecution alleges mr murdoch killed mr falconio after flagging down the couple 's orange camper van on a remote stretch of the stuart highway , near barrow creek , about 200 miles north of alice springs on 14 july , 2001 .
but mr algie suggested his client may have been " set up " by police .
referring to mr murdoch 's dna which was found on a set of makeshift handcuffs , mr algie asked the jury : " could they have been contaminated intentionally ?
could it be to attempt , in the vernacular , a set up , a fit up ?
" is it possible that police or somebody who had access to these items could have fitted him up ? "
the court also heard that miss lees used a piece of lip balm to try to ease the handcuffs off her wrists after escaping from her attacker 's vehicle .
its lid was found under a bush , but the lip balm itself and two pieces of black tape which miss lees said she bit off the handcuffs were not found until three months later in october when police returned to the scene on an " orientation " exercise - even though they were discovered in the same place .
mr algie said : " it 's almost embarrassing to suggest that two crime scene officers in these circumstances would not have searched around the area . "
the defence lawyer said the most obvious explanation was that " somebody has played around with the evidence to make it look like the lid and the tape was there when it was not .
" or is it , as has been suggested in cross examination , that some kangaroo came along and took it away for a few months , and later brought it back - or perhaps it was a dingo ? "
mr algie concluded : " it 's yet another example of police manipulating the evidence to perhaps better the case to make it look a little better , with no harm done . "
the lawyer also said there was " absolutely no rational explanation " why anyone would kill the backpacker in such a remote spot and then move the body .
" why would you possibly pick up a dead body , complete with blood presumably , and put it in your car ?
