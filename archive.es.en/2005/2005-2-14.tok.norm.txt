20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .
but with spain comprising 17 highly autonomous regions , the national trend in favor of the constitution does not apply across the board . moderate basque and catalan nationalists stand firmly behind the ruling socialist party and the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
but the united left , the catalan republican left - which is in a coalition government in the catalan regional parliament alongside mainstream socialists - and the galician nationalist party have called on their voters to reject the treaty .
also in the no camp is former prime minister jose maria aznar , who believes the treaty relegates spain to a " small " player with little influence on the eu stage . a significant minority of basques and catalans , while favoring ties to brussels , at the same time want to see such ties managed in the context of looser links with madrid . the two main spanish unions , the pro-socialist ugt and the pro-communist ccoo , favor the text in the belief it would uphold worker 's professional and social rights .
" spanish workers are convinced that the eu is a constant source of social progress , " said ugt secretary general candido mendez . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the biggest reform in the history of the european union .

it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too . " the anonymity works perfectly because the concept affords them a kind of protection , " she said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by .

with closest rivals schalke 04 dispensing of vfl wolfsburg on saturday , the 3-1 defeat leaves bayern on top on goal difference only . bayern could have opened up a three-point lead over second-place schalke with victory but are now level on 41 points with the royal blues after two goals from buckley and one from massimilano porcello . bielefeld had not won against bayern for eight years but took advantage of a snow-covered pitch to record a historic win .
after porcello crashed a volley past oliver kahn in the 23rd minute , bayern were on the ropes .
despite a spirited comeback , the league leaders were caught by a rapid counter-attack midway through the second half which was finished in style by buckley 's left boot as munich chased parity . hope for bayern came in the form of a sweetly struck free-kick by the brazilian lucio on 80 minutes but the day belonged to buckley .

five minutes later the points were sealed with pole jacek krzynowek drilling home a left-footed shot . bvb on the up , elevators look grounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund 's jan koller borussia dortmund continue to put daylight between themselves and the relegation zone after a dismal season to date .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way .

" in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .

rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .
the introduction of screens featuring events , advertisements and news flashes in subways in berlin has also meant that commuters now increasingly stare at them rather than peruse the paper . continue reading to find out how literature is getting cheaper and cooler 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too .

it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too . " the anonymity works perfectly because the concept affords them a kind of protection , " she said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .

it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too . " the anonymity works perfectly because the concept affords them a kind of protection , " she said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .
the introduction of screens featuring events , advertisements and news flashes in subways in berlin has also meant that commuters now increasingly stare at them rather than peruse the paper . continue reading to find out how literature is getting cheaper and cooler 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .
and companies could easily engage in nasty marketing battles , leaving disparaging virtual comments about the competition throughout town . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .
but with spain comprising 17 highly autonomous regions , the national trend in favor of the constitution does not apply across the board . moderate basque and catalan nationalists stand firmly behind the ruling socialist party and the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
but the united left , the catalan republican left - which is in a coalition government in the catalan regional parliament alongside mainstream socialists - and the galician nationalist party have called on their voters to reject the treaty .
also in the no camp is former prime minister jose maria aznar , who believes the treaty relegates spain to a " small " player with little influence on the eu stage . a significant minority of basques and catalans , while favoring ties to brussels , at the same time want to see such ties managed in the context of looser links with madrid . the two main spanish unions , the pro-socialist ugt and the pro-communist ccoo , favor the text in the belief it would uphold worker 's professional and social rights .
" spanish workers are convinced that the eu is a constant source of social progress , " said ugt secretary general candido mendez . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the biggest reform in the history of the european union .

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .
and companies could easily engage in nasty marketing battles , leaving disparaging virtual comments about the competition throughout town . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .

to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .

the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .
but with spain comprising 17 highly autonomous regions , the national trend in favor of the constitution does not apply across the board . moderate basque and catalan nationalists stand firmly behind the ruling socialist party and the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
but the united left , the catalan republican left - which is in a coalition government in the catalan regional parliament alongside mainstream socialists - and the galician nationalist party have called on their voters to reject the treaty .
also in the no camp is former prime minister jose maria aznar , who believes the treaty relegates spain to a " small " player with little influence on the eu stage . a significant minority of basques and catalans , while favoring ties to brussels , at the same time want to see such ties managed in the context of looser links with madrid . the two main spanish unions , the pro-socialist ugt and the pro-communist ccoo , favor the text in the belief it would uphold worker 's professional and social rights .

20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .
but with spain comprising 17 highly autonomous regions , the national trend in favor of the constitution does not apply across the board . moderate basque and catalan nationalists stand firmly behind the ruling socialist party and the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
but the united left , the catalan republican left - which is in a coalition government in the catalan regional parliament alongside mainstream socialists - and the galician nationalist party have called on their voters to reject the treaty .
also in the no camp is former prime minister jose maria aznar , who believes the treaty relegates spain to a " small " player with little influence on the eu stage . a significant minority of basques and catalans , while favoring ties to brussels , at the same time want to see such ties managed in the context of looser links with madrid . the two main spanish unions , the pro-socialist ugt and the pro-communist ccoo , favor the text in the belief it would uphold worker 's professional and social rights .
" spanish workers are convinced that the eu is a constant source of social progress , " said ugt secretary general candido mendez . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european constitution with the creation of a president , foreign minister and new powers centralized in brussels , the eu constitution proposes the biggest reform in the history of the european union .

but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution .

it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .
the introduction of screens featuring events , advertisements and news flashes in subways in berlin has also meant that commuters now increasingly stare at them rather than peruse the paper . continue reading to find out how literature is getting cheaper and cooler 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too . " the anonymity works perfectly because the concept affords them a kind of protection , " she said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .
the introduction of screens featuring events , advertisements and news flashes in subways in berlin has also meant that commuters now increasingly stare at them rather than peruse the paper . continue reading to find out how literature is getting cheaper and cooler 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2005 bringing people back to the book back to first page back 2/2 chocolates , chips and novels to counter the trend , the berlin publishing company sukultur hit upon the idea of putting literature within the economic and practical reach of people .
it began placing small books costing € 1 -lrb- $ 1.28 -rrb- in candy vending machines at railway stations across germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vending machines with the small sukultur novels the tiny yellow books , reminiscent of the famous reclam series featuring works by literary greats like goethe , kant and shakespeare , compete with chocolate bars , chips and gummi bears .
unlike the school-book series the texts in the vending machines feature largely unknown , young authors and journalists who write offbeat short stories and poems no longer than 24 pages . " we want to make good literature more accessible to the common man , " said frank maleu , head of sukultur .
" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .
the company , which tries to publish four new books each month , has sold some 10,000 of them since they launched the idea at the end of 2003 . frank bartschel , a 36-year-old engineer who bought one of the books - his second so far - along with a candy bar at berlin 's main zoo railway station , said it made perfect reading for his daily 40-minute commute to work . " there are days when i do n't want to read the latest unemployment figures in the paper and it 's great instead to throw myself into a good story , " he said .
" and i 'm always finished just before my stop arrives . " " fun and original " good and cheap and even smaller seems to be munich-based publishing company blumenbar 's mantra .
last year , the tiny company unveiled the so-called cigarette novel - available for € 2 at bookstores - just months after the eu issued directives that cigarette packs must carry dire and prominent warnings such as " smokers die earlier " or " smoking leads to impotence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cigarette novels the concept involves very short stories printed on two sides of a tiny cardboard cover that can be slipped over a cigarette packet and cover up the health warnings .
the publishing company has recruited famous names like " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer and filmmaker doris dörrie to write the stories . " it 's not a statement about smoking but rather against an aesthetically repulsive health warning in typical governmental fashion , " said wolfgang farkas , head of blumenbar .
" we thought the idea was fun and original and provided ordinary people with a good , cheap read . " platform for budding authors there 's also a positive fallout to the unconventional initiatives to popularize literature : it allows a much-needed platform for young , budding writers and playwrights to get their works across to a larger audience .
blumenbar , for instance , last year held a competition for young authors to write their cigarette novels in the future .
some 700 people entered . frimmer of the " door speakers " project said some of their authors were first timers , too . " the anonymity works perfectly because the concept affords them a kind of protection , " she said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the " white rose " 60 years ago , on feb .
22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of .

" i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .

part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way .

rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the " white rose " 60 years ago , on feb .
22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .

" we want to strip it of its hallowed status and give a person the feeling that it 's just another consumer product like a chocolate bar . " maleu 's calculation that the concept would draw on a pool of untapped readers - commuters and people on the move - seems to be working .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .

when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

a report suggests 2004 was another bad year for the minicar . it was heralded as the future of urban personal transport when it was launched in 1998 ; the car which was environmentally-friendly , ergonomically appealing and space efficient .
but in its seventh year of production , the smart , daimlerchrysler 's unique minicar , has been revealed in the german media as a costly failure with 2004 losses recorded at around € 600 million -lrb- $ 771.6 million -rrb- , taking the overall dent in its creators pocket to the tune of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . quoting a senior daimlerchrysler executive who wished to remain anonymous , the german news magazine der spiegel carried a report on monday that revealed the extent of smart 's financial hemorrhaging and the confusion surrounding the project 's immediate future . with its parent company posting heavy losses year-on-year and subsidiaries being bailed like buckets of sea water from a listing ship , the smart looks to be the latest albatross around the neck of the ailing german auto giant .
daimlerchrysler seems to be at a loss as to what it can do to save its minicar brand . source suggests future models to be scrapped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although there has been no official response to the size of smart 's losses in 2004 , the spiegel report stated that the daimlerchrysler source thought it likely that the company would most likely reduce the scale of the project , dropping plans for a sport-utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- while continuing with development of the next generation of its original two-seater fortwo . however , as recently as last week jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive , stated that fixing smart was one part of repairing the damage done to mercedes-benz group 's profitability , which fell dramatically in 2004 .
" i am not promising too much when i say that we will be in control of the challenging situation at mercedes-benz passenger cars within the next 12 months , " schrempp said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp added that losses had been substantial and that the issue of smart 's profitability would have to be addressed sooner rather than later .
the company hoped to have a new plan in place by april or may .
schrempp also ruled out any move to shut down smart permanently . partnerships a way to save smart the daimlerchrysler ceo said in the interview that mercedes-benz was working on a " long-term business model " for smart which included " reviewing possible partnerships " . no other automaker , however , has expressed much interest in smart , schrempp added , except for mitsubishi which is itself in dire financial straits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news of such huge losses comes at a time when mercedes plans to bring the smart to the united states although no firm date for the official introduction has been announced .
during a conference call interview with analysts and journalists last week , eckhard cordes , the new chief executive of the mercedes-benz group , said the company was still considering the export of smart cars to the united states despite the ill-health of the brand . suv future in severe doubt meanwhile , the suv concept model was pulled from the 2005 north american international auto show at the last minute , adding to the confusion about daimlerchrysler 's intentions .
the official line was that the vehicle was pulled because it was n't ready but other reports also suggested the suv , supposed to be the cornerstone of the marketing effort in the united states , had become a victim of some last-minute cost cutting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

after defeat at bielefeld , only goal difference seperates bayern from schalke 04 . they may be the club at the summit of the bundesliga at the moment but bayern munich are hanging onto that honor by the skin of their collective teeth after the bavarian giants were gunned down in spectacular style by arminia bielefeld 's south african international striker delron buckley on sunday .
with closest rivals schalke 04 dispensing of vfl wolfsburg on saturday , the 3-1 defeat leaves bayern on top on goal difference only . bayern could have opened up a three-point lead over second-place schalke with victory but are now level on 41 points with the royal blues after two goals from buckley and one from massimilano porcello . bielefeld had not won against bayern for eight years but took advantage of a snow-covered pitch to record a historic win .
after porcello crashed a volley past oliver kahn in the 23rd minute , bayern were on the ropes .
despite a spirited comeback , the league leaders were caught by a rapid counter-attack midway through the second half which was finished in style by buckley 's left boot as munich chased parity . hope for bayern came in the form of a sweetly struck free-kick by the brazilian lucio on 80 minutes but the day belonged to buckley .
it certainly was n't oli kahn 's as the bielefeld striker compounded munich 's misery by slotting the ball through the bayern keeper 's to clinch the spoils . listing schalke steady with win over wolves the shock defeat heaped the pressure on felix magath 's side and added championship importance to schalke 's 3-0 defeat of wolfsburg on saturday .
the royal blues steadied their listing ship at the weekend to end a run of bad form that had seen them win just one point from the last two games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah they could have been four goals to the good by the end of the first half in the arena aufschalke but had to settle for just one , from german international gerald asamoah , by the break . an ebbe sand header and mike hanke 's icing on the cake sent the wolves crashing to their seventh defeat in eight games , a run which has seen their championship aspirations turn into nightmares of what could have been .
as for schalke , even ailton missed penalty in the 50th minute could n't dampen the spirits of a campaign which has so far been a reverse of the one suffered by their woeful opponents ' . bremen out but not down werder bremen manager thomas schaaf may have conceded that their championship defense is all but over but saturday 's 2-0 over borussia monchengladbach , and vfb stuttgart 's 2-1 reverse at sv hamburg , saw his title holders move up to third . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's strikers mirolav klose , left , and mohamed zidan .
an injury-ravaged bremen were forced into fielding 18-year-old aaron hunt in the starting line-up but the teenager repaid the vote of confidence with the first goal .
on his full bundesliga debut hunt popped up to score in the 29 minute .
substitute mohammed zidan added a second late on to calm the nerves at the weserstadion and severely dent gladbach coach dick advocaat 's revolution . comical stuttgart blow title in hamburg it looks increasingly like another season of " close but no cigar " for vfb stuttgart .
another year of exciting soccer at the gottlieb daimler stadium is ending like a damp squib and saturday 's defeat to hamburg epitomized the south german club 's lack of concentration and staying power . despite imre szabics putting vfb ahead on the quarter hour mark , comical defending helped hamburg equalize through sergei barbarez two minutes later in front of their home crowd at the aol arena . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb stuttgart 's coach matthias sammer was furious at his side 's defensive blunders .
stuttgart could not find the spark to reply and belgian international daniel van buyten scored the winner for hsv on 54 minutes as stuttgart manager matthias sammer was left cursing more defensive lapses .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .

many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

a report suggests 2004 was another bad year for the minicar . it was heralded as the future of urban personal transport when it was launched in 1998 ; the car which was environmentally-friendly , ergonomically appealing and space efficient .
but in its seventh year of production , the smart , daimlerchrysler 's unique minicar , has been revealed in the german media as a costly failure with 2004 losses recorded at around € 600 million -lrb- $ 771.6 million -rrb- , taking the overall dent in its creators pocket to the tune of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . quoting a senior daimlerchrysler executive who wished to remain anonymous , the german news magazine der spiegel carried a report on monday that revealed the extent of smart 's financial hemorrhaging and the confusion surrounding the project 's immediate future . with its parent company posting heavy losses year-on-year and subsidiaries being bailed like buckets of sea water from a listing ship , the smart looks to be the latest albatross around the neck of the ailing german auto giant .
daimlerchrysler seems to be at a loss as to what it can do to save its minicar brand . source suggests future models to be scrapped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although there has been no official response to the size of smart 's losses in 2004 , the spiegel report stated that the daimlerchrysler source thought it likely that the company would most likely reduce the scale of the project , dropping plans for a sport-utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- while continuing with development of the next generation of its original two-seater fortwo . however , as recently as last week jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive , stated that fixing smart was one part of repairing the damage done to mercedes-benz group 's profitability , which fell dramatically in 2004 .
" i am not promising too much when i say that we will be in control of the challenging situation at mercedes-benz passenger cars within the next 12 months , " schrempp said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp added that losses had been substantial and that the issue of smart 's profitability would have to be addressed sooner rather than later .
the company hoped to have a new plan in place by april or may .
schrempp also ruled out any move to shut down smart permanently . partnerships a way to save smart the daimlerchrysler ceo said in the interview that mercedes-benz was working on a " long-term business model " for smart which included " reviewing possible partnerships " . no other automaker , however , has expressed much interest in smart , schrempp added , except for mitsubishi which is itself in dire financial straits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news of such huge losses comes at a time when mercedes plans to bring the smart to the united states although no firm date for the official introduction has been announced .
during a conference call interview with analysts and journalists last week , eckhard cordes , the new chief executive of the mercedes-benz group , said the company was still considering the export of smart cars to the united states despite the ill-health of the brand . suv future in severe doubt meanwhile , the suv concept model was pulled from the 2005 north american international auto show at the last minute , adding to the confusion about daimlerchrysler 's intentions .
the official line was that the vehicle was pulled because it was n't ready but other reports also suggested the suv , supposed to be the cornerstone of the marketing effort in the united states , had become a victim of some last-minute cost cutting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .

when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way .

" in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .

rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

a report suggests 2004 was another bad year for the minicar . it was heralded as the future of urban personal transport when it was launched in 1998 ; the car which was environmentally-friendly , ergonomically appealing and space efficient .
but in its seventh year of production , the smart , daimlerchrysler 's unique minicar , has been revealed in the german media as a costly failure with 2004 losses recorded at around € 600 million -lrb- $ 771.6 million -rrb- , taking the overall dent in its creators pocket to the tune of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . quoting a senior daimlerchrysler executive who wished to remain anonymous , the german news magazine der spiegel carried a report on monday that revealed the extent of smart 's financial hemorrhaging and the confusion surrounding the project 's immediate future . with its parent company posting heavy losses year-on-year and subsidiaries being bailed like buckets of sea water from a listing ship , the smart looks to be the latest albatross around the neck of the ailing german auto giant .
daimlerchrysler seems to be at a loss as to what it can do to save its minicar brand . source suggests future models to be scrapped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although there has been no official response to the size of smart 's losses in 2004 , the spiegel report stated that the daimlerchrysler source thought it likely that the company would most likely reduce the scale of the project , dropping plans for a sport-utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- while continuing with development of the next generation of its original two-seater fortwo . however , as recently as last week jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive , stated that fixing smart was one part of repairing the damage done to mercedes-benz group 's profitability , which fell dramatically in 2004 .
" i am not promising too much when i say that we will be in control of the challenging situation at mercedes-benz passenger cars within the next 12 months , " schrempp said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp added that losses had been substantial and that the issue of smart 's profitability would have to be addressed sooner rather than later .
the company hoped to have a new plan in place by april or may .
schrempp also ruled out any move to shut down smart permanently . partnerships a way to save smart the daimlerchrysler ceo said in the interview that mercedes-benz was working on a " long-term business model " for smart which included " reviewing possible partnerships " . no other automaker , however , has expressed much interest in smart , schrempp added , except for mitsubishi which is itself in dire financial straits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news of such huge losses comes at a time when mercedes plans to bring the smart to the united states although no firm date for the official introduction has been announced .
during a conference call interview with analysts and journalists last week , eckhard cordes , the new chief executive of the mercedes-benz group , said the company was still considering the export of smart cars to the united states despite the ill-health of the brand . suv future in severe doubt meanwhile , the suv concept model was pulled from the 2005 north american international auto show at the last minute , adding to the confusion about daimlerchrysler 's intentions .
the official line was that the vehicle was pulled because it was n't ready but other reports also suggested the suv , supposed to be the cornerstone of the marketing effort in the united states , had become a victim of some last-minute cost cutting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carmakers pin us hopes on new models as the north american international auto show gets underway in detroit this week , german carmakers are hoping new models will increase their market share in america despite the strong euro .

a report suggests 2004 was another bad year for the minicar . it was heralded as the future of urban personal transport when it was launched in 1998 ; the car which was environmentally-friendly , ergonomically appealing and space efficient .
but in its seventh year of production , the smart , daimlerchrysler 's unique minicar , has been revealed in the german media as a costly failure with 2004 losses recorded at around € 600 million -lrb- $ 771.6 million -rrb- , taking the overall dent in its creators pocket to the tune of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . quoting a senior daimlerchrysler executive who wished to remain anonymous , the german news magazine der spiegel carried a report on monday that revealed the extent of smart 's financial hemorrhaging and the confusion surrounding the project 's immediate future . with its parent company posting heavy losses year-on-year and subsidiaries being bailed like buckets of sea water from a listing ship , the smart looks to be the latest albatross around the neck of the ailing german auto giant .
daimlerchrysler seems to be at a loss as to what it can do to save its minicar brand . source suggests future models to be scrapped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although there has been no official response to the size of smart 's losses in 2004 , the spiegel report stated that the daimlerchrysler source thought it likely that the company would most likely reduce the scale of the project , dropping plans for a sport-utility vehicle -lrb- suv -rrb- while continuing with development of the next generation of its original two-seater fortwo . however , as recently as last week jürgen schrempp , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive , stated that fixing smart was one part of repairing the damage done to mercedes-benz group 's profitability , which fell dramatically in 2004 .
" i am not promising too much when i say that we will be in control of the challenging situation at mercedes-benz passenger cars within the next 12 months , " schrempp said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp added that losses had been substantial and that the issue of smart 's profitability would have to be addressed sooner rather than later .
the company hoped to have a new plan in place by april or may .
schrempp also ruled out any move to shut down smart permanently . partnerships a way to save smart the daimlerchrysler ceo said in the interview that mercedes-benz was working on a " long-term business model " for smart which included " reviewing possible partnerships " . no other automaker , however , has expressed much interest in smart , schrempp added , except for mitsubishi which is itself in dire financial straits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news of such huge losses comes at a time when mercedes plans to bring the smart to the united states although no firm date for the official introduction has been announced .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .
but with spain comprising 17 highly autonomous regions , the national trend in favor of the constitution does not apply across the board . moderate basque and catalan nationalists stand firmly behind the ruling socialist party and the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
but the united left , the catalan republican left - which is in a coalition government in the catalan regional parliament alongside mainstream socialists - and the galician nationalist party have called on their voters to reject the treaty .
also in the no camp is former prime minister jose maria aznar , who believes the treaty relegates spain to a " small " player with little influence on the eu stage . a significant minority of basques and catalans , while favoring ties to brussels , at the same time want to see such ties managed in the context of looser links with madrid . the two main spanish unions , the pro-socialist ugt and the pro-communist ccoo , favor the text in the belief it would uphold worker 's professional and social rights .

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .
but with spain comprising 17 highly autonomous regions , the national trend in favor of the constitution does not apply across the board . moderate basque and catalan nationalists stand firmly behind the ruling socialist party and the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- .
but the united left , the catalan republican left - which is in a coalition government in the catalan regional parliament alongside mainstream socialists - and the galician nationalist party have called on their voters to reject the treaty .
also in the no camp is former prime minister jose maria aznar , who believes the treaty relegates spain to a " small " player with little influence on the eu stage . a significant minority of basques and catalans , while favoring ties to brussels , at the same time want to see such ties managed in the context of looser links with madrid . the two main spanish unions , the pro-socialist ugt and the pro-communist ccoo , favor the text in the belief it would uphold worker 's professional and social rights .

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .
and companies could easily engage in nasty marketing battles , leaving disparaging virtual comments about the competition throughout town . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.02.2005 virtual graffiti - a sign of the future ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists can leave their mark without a spray can in the future possibly inspired by those yellow " post-it " notes ubiquitous in workplaces , researchers for german cell phone manufacturer siemens have developed technology that lets users leave virtual graffiti in their wake . far from encouraging mobile phone users to deface public property , " digital graffito , " as siemens had dubbed the technology , would allow people to affix virtual information to locations .
tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .
and companies could easily engage in nasty marketing battles , leaving disparaging virtual comments about the competition throughout town . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .

according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .
and companies could easily engage in nasty marketing battles , leaving disparaging virtual comments about the competition throughout town . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de umts ...

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .
" this panel should submit a report to the heads of state and government of nato and the european union by the beginning of 2006 on the basis of its analysis and proposals .
the necessary conclusions could then be drawn , " he said . schröder 's unusually strong remarks , less than two weeks before a nato summit , follow a visit to germany this month by us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who invited berlin to demonstrate that it is willing to improve its relations with washington .
rice , whose visit will be followed by us president george w. bush on february 23 , urged germany to play a greater role in iraq following the landmark elections there last month . schröder , who vehemently opposed the us-led war to oust saddam hussein , appears likely to expand germany 's role in training iraq 's overwhelmed police and military forces within the framework of nato . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debating nato 's future in munich the us and europe agreed in munich saturday on a need to renew their transatlantic security vows to confront islamic extremism , but said they did not yet know how to adapt their alliance to new dangers .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .

" the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .

" i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .
the introduction of screens featuring events , advertisements and news flashes in subways in berlin has also meant that commuters now increasingly stare at them rather than peruse the paper . continue reading to find out how literature is getting cheaper and cooler 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .

the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .

" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .

a report suggests 2004 was another bad year for the minicar . it was heralded as the future of urban personal transport when it was launched in 1998 ; the car which was environmentally-friendly , ergonomically appealing and space efficient .
but in its seventh year of production , the smart , daimlerchrysler 's unique minicar , has been revealed in the german media as a costly failure with 2004 losses recorded at around € 600 million -lrb- $ 771.6 million -rrb- , taking the overall dent in its creators pocket to the tune of € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- . quoting a senior daimlerchrysler executive who wished to remain anonymous , the german news magazine der spiegel carried a report on monday that revealed the extent of smart 's financial hemorrhaging and the confusion surrounding the project 's immediate future . with its parent company posting heavy losses year-on-year and subsidiaries being bailed like buckets of sea water from a listing ship , the smart looks to be the latest albatross around the neck of the ailing german auto giant .

" i am not promising too much when i say that we will be in control of the challenging situation at mercedes-benz passenger cars within the next 12 months , " schrempp said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp added that losses had been substantial and that the issue of smart 's profitability would have to be addressed sooner rather than later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2005 anti-nazi film gets warm reception großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia jentsch portrays resistance heroine sophie scholl the first of three german films in competition at the berlinale opened to warm applause and more than a few tears on sunday .
" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

" javier solana , the european union 's top foreign policy representative , soundly rejected the chancellor 's initiative .
" nato has not lost any of its relevance .
one should n't dramatize things that are n't dramatic , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper on monday . in an interview with german broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected the criticism that the alliance was not an appropriate forum for political matters .
" the alliance is both militarily and politically active in order to tackle present challenges , " he said , adding nato would remain the primary place for transatlantic consultations .
" that was the case in the past , is the case now and should , in my opinion , stay that way . " the german press acknowledged that schröder had been ill , but said struck had been ill-prepared , unable to say whether the chancellor wanted the military alliance dissolved , and that german aides were surprised and disappointed . new transatlantic tension ? the daily die welt headlined with " schröder alienates his nato partners " and puts new strains on relations with washington , which were already badly frayed by germany 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq .
" if europe 's most important nato partner starts questioning the alliance , a new atlantic crisis will erupt , " the country 's most widely-read newspaper , bild , said in an editorial . " in the way he conveyed the idea he has done serious if not irreparable damage , " the süddeutsche zeitung wrote , adding that the chancellor had " left the nato secretary general thinking he is doing a bad job . " in his speech , schröder also urged the european union and the united states to set up a panel of senior and independent officials to analyze new ways to boost transatlantic relations .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.02.2005 anti-nazi film gets warm reception großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia jentsch portrays resistance heroine sophie scholl the first of three german films in competition at the berlinale opened to warm applause and more than a few tears on sunday .
" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

22 , 1943 , three students of the munich-based resistance group “ white rose ” were executed for inciting young people to rise against hitler - a fact that many young germans today are unaware of .

" sophie scholl - the final days " tells the story of a young anti-nazi resistance fighter . sophie scholl 's story is a familiar one .
she and her brother were among the members of the white rose student movement , which printed and distributed flyers inciting germans to " passive resistance " against hitler and the nazis .
the siblings were arrested when a janitor spotted them placing stacks of leaflets around the main hall of munich 's ludwig-maximilian university . following their interrogation by the gestapo , sophie and hans scholl were tried for treason along with fellow white rose member christoph probst .
all three were executed on feb .
22 , 1943 .
further trials and executions of other white rose members followed . german directors have brought the story to the screen before .
in 1982 , percy adlon made " five last days , " while four years later , michael verhoeven made " the white rose . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc rothemund but the director of " sophie scholl - the final days , " marc rothemund -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he was inspired to look at the story again when , following the 60th anniversary of sophie 's death , he read the transcripts of her interrogation and trial , which had been preserved over the decades in an archive of the east german secret police . " the transcripts had an unbelievable effect on me , " rothemund said .
" she lied so well for five hours to the gestapo that they almost believed her and let her go .
and then , when the gestapo found more evidence , sophie and hans made such an effort to convince everybody that they were the only ones involved .
it was so new for me , and so dramatic , that it was perfect for a film . " new breed of filmmaker rothemund 's film picks up where verhoeven 's left off - with the arrest and interrogation of the scholl siblings .
throughout , we experience the events leading up to the execution from the perspective of sophie , movingly portrayed by germany 's new rising star , julia jentsch . bildunterschrift : scene from " sophie scholl - the final days " " we wanted the audience to bind themselves to a single character and identify with her , " rothemund said . his decision to keep the focus on sophie 's emotional journey is partly what helps give the film its mainstream appeal .
with " sophie scholl - the final days " rothemund joins the ranks of a new breed of german filmmaker - young directors who are able to look at the nazi era and make dramatic , almost hollywood-style films without the ponderous , edifying dynamic that characterized past films on the topic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as adolf hitler in the film " downfall " german audiences are still adjusting to the change .
when oliver hirschbiegel 's oscar-nominated film about hitler 's final days , " the downfall " was released , movie-goers complained that the film showed too much of the dictator 's human side . in the same vein is dennis gansel 's " napola , " a typical coming-of-age story about a working-class boy attending a private school - except that the school in question is the nazis ' elite training facility for future leaders of the third reich . " i think it 's a question of a new generation looking at this history from a new perspective , " said fred breinersdorf , who wrote the " sophie scholl " screenplay .
" the first generation who lived through the war felt guilty and hopeless .
the second generation was more analytical and pedagogical .
but the new generation sees the nazi period in more personal terms , and they ask things like , ' what would i have done in that situation ?
would i have had the courage to resist ? " sending the right message ? critics of the new , personal approach of these films claim that they only serve to glorify the third reich - a claim rothemund denies . speaking to reporters after his film was screened at the berlinale , he said the reactions the film got from eyewitnesses to the events surrounding the members of the white rose prove the opposite .
people who knew sophie and hans scholl told him of their shock and dismay each time they open the newspaper and read about the activities of neo-nazis in germany . " the fact that this danger is still present shows how important it is to make these films , " rothemund said .
" we have to make such films to show young people today , to affect them emotionally , as long as the threat of neo-nazis still exists .

but he denied the government was encouraging criminality . fischer told reporters staked outside his greens party headquarters that he accepted the blame for any " mistakes " made after his ministry in 1999 eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas . " i carry the political responsibility for possible oversights or mistakes by my staff , " said fischer , who is also deputy chancellor .
" that is the responsibility of a minister . " but he lashed out at the conservative opposition , which he accused of launching a campaign against him , saying that the initial liberalization of the visa rules had been introduced on their watch .
chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and greens came to power in 1998 . the opposition says the 1999 edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe to enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , many of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected to be drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue three million visas each year on average .
however , fischer said the edict had nothing to do with criminal activity at the embassy in kiev . parliamentary investigation following the resignation friday of his deputy , ludger volmer , over the scandal , conservatives over the weekend called for fischer , often rated germany 's most popular politician , to step down .
christian democratic leader angela merkel said the opposition would go over the charges " piece by piece " in parliamentary investigative hearings . " he talks of political responsibility but instead of taking it he pushes it off on his employees , " merkel said . but the greens member of the parliamentary investigation , jerzy montag , said an earlier easing of visa requirement was more responsible for the abuse by criminals , rather than the latest edict from the foreign ministry .
he said in the early 1990s a so-called " travel agency " policy that did away with personal visa approval by embassy personnel was to blame . and schröder , who owes his re-election in 2002 to the strong showing of fischer 's greens party , said he would stand by his minister .
" joschka fischer has my full trust and my full support , " schröder told reporters before a meeting of his social democrats . fischer returned early saturday from a nine-day tour of australia , new zealand and southeast asia during which he refused to comment on the brewing affair in berlin . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

tourists would be the most obvious benefactors of the new technology that could send historical information to their mobile phones , notebooks or pdas as they make their way past city landmarks . users can access a city map marked with nearby locations where they can pick up the digital messages - text , sound or images .
and when they 're on or near the spot , they can receive the digital graffiti directly on their displays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will mobiles replace post-its ?
the difference between the new technology and text messaging is that the digital graffiti is n't sent to a particular address .
instead it can be received by one or more people when they reach the physical location defined by the person who sent the message .
to set a message , one merely sends it to a server , where it is saved and affixed to the location . invisible guides siemens developers have shown it works with a prototype completed at the university of linz and the ars electronica center in austria . " in two or three years digital graffito will be ready for the market , " according to project head gerd kölb said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not your traditional graffiti but will users be ready ?
digital graffito can only locate messages with mobile devices outfitted with global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which is n't quite the industry standard .
and it will still be more than a few years before all mobile phones have gps , andreas tasch of munich 's technical university told the süddeutsche zeitung daily . in a year-long trial involving 100 people , the munich paper tested the technology , and although the testers were able to locate each other , they were n't able to leave their own virtual graffito for others to receive .
they also criticized the system for frequently being slow . " the testers all found the principle of the technology great , but the technology just is n't polished , " tasch said . the süddeutsche zeitung identified other potential problems that will need resolving : in order to show people where to find the invisible messages , the server must retrace their position every 30 seconds , a nightmare in terms of data protection .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .

20 referendum .
but with opposition spread through disparate parties , spain reflects a wider climate of uncertainty in the eu . after spending four decades in the cold under military dictator general francisco franco , who ruled with an iron fist since the nation 's civil war , spain expects to become the first country to ratify the eu constitution by popular vote in a feb .
20 referendum . a continental backwater before it joined the eu club along with neighbor portugal in 1986 , spain has modernized its economy and society since accession and its leaders are hoping the electorate will show their political maturity by enthusiastically backing the constitutional project . spain , the first of around a dozen countries planning a referendum , is set to give the wider eu ' yes ' camp an early boost with the bulk of voters here expressing an opinion saying they are in favor . with the eu bloc having grown last year to 25 member states , the constitution , which in theory requires the approval of each , is designed to simplify the body 's decision-making process . among those countries preferring the parliamentary route , slovenia , lithuania and hungary have already ratified the text , as has the lower house of the italian parliament , though the italian upper chamber still has to ratify it . zapatero an enthusiastic advocate spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has embarked on a punishing schedule of rallies to push for a vote for the constitution . " this referendum consolidates the idea of living together , " zapatero told a madrid rally to open his campaign .
" a ' yes ' sends out a message to all europeans and to ourselves as spaniards that we wish to proclaim the foremost values of -lrb- european -rrb- cohabitation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish government hopes the people will raise their hands and vote in favor .
hailing the substantial aid the eu has handed out to spain since its accession , zapatero said voters should vote yes " in gratitude to all that europe has done to foster our well-being , " with the bloc having set in train and nurtured " the process of european construction to which we owe so much . " javier valenzuela , a spokesman for zapatero , has also stressed that " it is important that the first country to vote in a referendum sends out a strong message backing europe . " socialist party secretary general jose blanco said spaniards should recognize the benefits accruing from membership and that a no vote would produce " a europe more divided and weaker , and a weaker spain . " spanish citizens asked for approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu constitution was draften in 2003 spanish voters are called upon to answer the question : " do you approve the treaty instituting a constitution for europe ? "
according to opinion polls , around 45.3 percent of spain 's 34.6 million voters will back the text and only seven are pledging open opposition .
but more than a third have not made up their minds and fears abound of a low turnout . more than three quarters of the electorate profess to know little about the proposed constitution and the socialist government and other mainstream parties have been bombarding them with information in recent days in an attempt to rectify such ignorance . government polls show four in five spaniards back strong links with the eu , which has distributed some $ 100 billion in development aid to madrid since 1986 .
as a result , spain 's gdp now lags the eu average by barely 10 percent , compared to a third on entry . a divided spain divided over europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of the basque region , some of whose citizens are in favor and some are not .

according to an article in the newsmagazine der spiegel , the ham on german pizzas is often nothing but poor quality meat imitations .
according to the report , researchers from the bavarian institute of health and food safety tested 108 pizza samples from different sources and rejected two-thirds of them as substandard .
the ham imitations found by investigators often consisted primarily of gelatine to which had been added pieces of muscle , soy and whey protein combined with water .
the report said that the quality of pizza ingredients has been in decline since 1993 .
investigators found no appreciable difference between frozen pizzas from the supermarket and those made in restaurants . dw-world.de dw-world : frozen fondness not exactly known for their refined cuisine , a majority of germans turn to their freezers first even when wooing a potential partner on a first date , according to a new study .

with literature in vending machines , on cigarette packs and even broadcast over apartment intercoms , several initiatives are aiming to popularize the written word as germans read fewer books , preferring tv instead . a group of people on a street standing around the intercom of an apartment building might seem like nothing out of the ordinary .
but , if they 're all intently listening to a dramatic voice from the speaker reciting a love poem or raging about a political issue , then it 's not your everyday occurrence . the brainchild of a berlin-based artist and literary group , which calls itself the " door speakers , " the above scene has been played out all over the german capital since last summer .
the concept involves the nine authors of the group sitting in an apartment and taking turns at reading their prepared texts into the intercom every time the buzzer rings .
the authors and their audience outside never actually see each other . the works , ranging from stories , plays , texts and poems , are always just a few minutes long .
the author hangs up once he 's finished .
to hear more , all the listener on the street has to do is to push the buzzer again and another " door speaker " begins a recitation . " our main aim is to bring literature to the street , " said mia frimmer , a group member who pens essays and plays .
" it 's about taking it away from high-brow readings and the mainstream book business and making it accessible and fun to the passer-by . " the readings are free and those interested learn about them from flyers on lampposts or by word of mouth . " it 's fun not to know who and how many people are down there listening , " frimmer said .
" in a way it 's a subversive way of presenting literature .
it stimulates the imagination of the listener who 's trying to picture the person behind the voice . " germans turning their backs on books the " door speaker " readings are just the latest in a slew of ingenious initiatives attempting to make the written word cool and cheap at a time when germans are buying fewer books and spending even less time reading the ones they do get .
at the same time , the amount of time spent in front of the television is on the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight becoming rarer in germany germany 's book industry has recorded continually falling profits for the past few years .
part of the blame might be the sluggish economy , but statistics show that germans are simply reading less .
a recent study by the reading foundation together with the german ministry for education and research found that only 6 percent of a representative cross-section of 2,530 germans reached for a book every day and 45 percent said they hardly had anything to do with books . at the same time television viewing has risen dramatically .
in 2004 , the average german spent three and a half hours daily in front of the telly - a new record .
the introduction of screens featuring events , advertisements and news flashes in subways in berlin has also meant that commuters now increasingly stare at them rather than peruse the paper . continue reading to find out how literature is getting cheaper and cooler 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the reluctance to read the literary world has its eyes on frankfurt this week during the world 's largest book fair .

about half of england is served by gp co-operatives - groups of doctors and nurses who cover nights and weekends .
the co-operatives say they are being under-funded by about 10 % a year and want primary care trusts ' -lrb- pcts -rrb- spending on them to be investigated .
the nhs alliance , representing pcts , said it had warned previously they were short of money to fund co-operatives .
' late payments ' the co-operatives took on the out of hours service last year after most gps opted out of providing cover under a new contract .
the national association of gp co-operatives -lrb- nagpc -rrb- said that it costs between £ 5 and £ 15 a head each year to provide the service run by the teams , which are operated on a not-for-profit basis .
the association also claimed some co-operatives were being paid late . "
we are bound to have teething problems but this is an issue we need to address " dr michael dixon , nhs alliance nagpc chairman dr mark reynolds said : " there are a number of co-operatives which are suffering cash problems - either they are going to have to cut back on the quality of services or they are going to fold .
" it is important to remember we are providing a service of remarkably good value and if we ca n't provide the cover , people will use accident and emergency departments and that will cost the health service more . "
one co-operative in north yorkshire has already folded after having a request for more money rejected .
dr reynolds said he was going to write to the national audit office to ask for an investigation into the way co-operatives are funded .
the rest of the country is served mainly by internal pct teams , although there are a small number of private firms which provide out-of-hours cover .
difficulties dr michael dixon , chairman of the nhs alliance , which represents pcts , said difficulties were to be expected following change .
" we are bound to have teething problems but this is an issue we need to address , " he said .
" we warned at the start of this process that pcts were on average £ 250,000 short to fund the service . "
but he said the problems should be sorted out over the coming years as the government is increasing funding for pcts and he also expected more pcts to rely on nurses and paramedics , which cost less than gps .
chris town , a negotiator for nhs employers , which also represents pcts , added : " primary care trusts have a balancing act .
they need to make sure that out-of-hours services are high quality and they have to make sure that they get the best value for money . "
health minister john hutton said the government was committed to ensuring " every patient in the nhs has access to round-the-clock , 24-hour cover . "
he said pcts had sufficient money for out-of-hours cover as the government had increased funding by £ 300m .
and he added : " i do not see evidence that it -lsb- the new system -rsb- is not providing a quality service for patients . "
the nao said it would consider the co-operatives ' request for an investigation .

about half of england is served by gp co-operatives - groups of doctors and nurses who cover nights and weekends .
the co-operatives say they are being under-funded by about 10 % a year and want primary care trusts ' -lrb- pcts -rrb- spending on them to be investigated .
the nhs alliance , representing pcts , said it had warned previously they were short of money to fund co-operatives .
' late payments ' the co-operatives took on the out of hours service last year after most gps opted out of providing cover under a new contract .
the national association of gp co-operatives -lrb- nagpc -rrb- said that it costs between £ 5 and £ 15 a head each year to provide the service run by the teams , which are operated on a not-for-profit basis .
the association also claimed some co-operatives were being paid late .
we are bound to have teething problems but this is an issue we need to address dr michael dixon , nhs alliance nagpc chairman dr mark reynolds said : " there are a number of co-operatives which are suffering cash problems - either they are going to have to cut back on the quality of services or they are going to fold .
" it is important to remember we are providing a service of remarkably good value and if we ca n't provide the cover , people will use accident and emergency departments and that will cost the health service more . "
one co-operative in north yorkshire has already folded after having a request for more money rejected .
dr reynolds said he was going to write to the national audit office to ask for an investigation into the way co-operatives are funded .
the rest of the country is served mainly by internal pct teams , although there are a small number of private firms which provide out-of-hours cover .
difficulties dr michael dixon , chairman of the nhs alliance , which represents pcts , said difficulties were to be expected following change .
" we are bound to have teething problems but this is an issue we need to address , " he said .
" we warned at the start of this process that pcts were on average £ 250,000 short to fund the service . "
but he said the problems should be sorted out over the coming years as the government is increasing funding for pcts and he also expected more pcts to rely on nurses and paramedics , which cost less than gps .
chris town , a negotiator for nhs employers , which also represents pcts , added : " primary care trusts have a balancing act .
they need to make sure that out-of-hours services are high quality and they have to make sure that they get the best value for money . "
health minister john hutton said the government was committed to ensuring " every patient in the nhs has access to round-the-clock , 24-hour cover . "
he said pcts had sufficient money for out-of-hours cover as the government had increased funding by £ 300m .
and he added : " i do not see evidence that it -lsb- the new system -rsb- is not providing a quality service for patients . "
the nao said it would consider the co-operatives ' request for an investigation .

unison said around 1,500 employees of north cumbria acute nhs trust would get between £ 35,000 and £ 200,000 each .
the women , including nurses and clerical officers , complained they were paid less than men in equivalent posts .
the trust said a final deal had not been reached and unison claims of a £ 300m payout were " wildly exaggerated " .
' pay discrimination ' equal value claims were lodged in august 1997 for 14 different working categories , comparing women 's salaries against those of men .
unison general secretary dave prentis hailed a " fantastic result " after a " long , hard struggle " . "
this decision means that we will now press our claim for back pay for other health service staff , who may have suffered from an unfair pay system " unison " this demonstrates what we have always argued , that there has been historic , widespread pay discrimination in the health service against women .
" this decision means that we will now press our claim for back pay for other health service staff , who may have suffered from an unfair pay system . "
the women compared their pay with that of craftsmen and joiners , building labourers and all washers , works officers and maintenance assistants .
unison said pay rates , hours of work , pensions , weekend working rates and sick pay were all included in the comparisons .
' long wait ' two years ago , a panel of experts found in favour of the union 's claim .
unison said around 1,500 workers could now claim back pay for up to six years , with some receiving 14 years pay .
interest of between 50 % and 60 % will also be paid , the union claims .
linda weightman , 56 , a nurse at cumberland infirmary , said the " long wait " had been worth it .
" there will be some smiling faces ... and a few shocked ones as well .
" it will mean a lot to members who have had to retire through ill health . "
" it is premature to state that a deal has been agreed and financial estimates of the settlement , as quoted by unison , are wildly exaggerated " north cumbria acute nhs trust but in a statement , the trust denied a pay-out had been agreed .
it said : " although much progress has been made an overall agreement has not been reached .
" until such a time it would be inappropriate to prejudge the outcome .
" therefore , it is premature to state that a deal has been agreed and financial estimates of the settlement , as quoted by unison , are wildly exaggerated . "

chlamydia can cause infertility among women and can lead to disability among men .
wales already has the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in europe .

the latest figures for sexual infections in wales will be published by the british association for sexual health and hiv .

the family planning association has called for better access to education and information for young people because existing messages were failing to protect them .
dr marion lyons of the national public health service has been appointed by the welsh assembly to start to tackle the scale of the problem .
dr lyons agreed services had to be overhauled if teenagers were to be protected from life-threatening diseases such as hiv and syphilis .

the figures , from the scottish council for voluntary organisations , are being highlighted to coincide with the start of a voluntary sector fair in glasgow .
public confidence in charities fell after the scandals surrounding breast cancer research scotland and moonbeams .
but the new research found that people in scotland are giving a greater proportion of their income .
a typical scottish household will give £ 7.40 per week and 43 % of all adults in scotland do charity work , giving nine million hours every month .
these figures were compiled before the tsunami disaster and the unprecedented response from throughout the uk .
more people donating more time and money to good causes can only be good for scotland martin sime scvo charity giving remains strong , despite bad publicity in 2003 when it was revealed that only a fraction of the money raised for the breast cancer research scotland and moonbeams organisations actually went towards good causes .
on monday , a voluntary sector fair , called the gathering 2005 , will take place at the secc in glasgow .
it will run through to wednesday and organisers are hoping to attract more than 4,500 people .
scottish council for voluntary organisations -lrb- scvo -rrb- believes there is evidence of the increasing success that voluntary organisations are having in winning public sector funding for service delivery .
it says the average size of public sector contracts has risen by 16 % in the last year .
' vote of confidence ' martin sime , chief executive of the scvo , said : " this is good news for the voluntary sector and the people they serve .
" more people donating more time and money to good causes can only be good for scotland .
" more government support is yet another vote of confidence .
" we have long argued that voluntary organisations are a dynamic force for good in scotland and these survey findings demonstrate that the sector is having a growing impact across every area of public life .
" it is vital we capitalise on these trends and take advantage of the new charity law and support framework now being put in place . "

bp has a global spread of production assets the british energy giant has 13 oil fields in the region , and is thought to have about 18 billion barrels of proven oil and gas reserves worldwide .
it is a far cry from the old quip about bp - that their geologists were brilliant at finding oil , but , once found , did not know what to do with it .
bp has reported a 26 % rise in annual profits to $ 16.2bn -lrb- £ 8.7bn -rrb- , after benefiting from high oil prices .

the british energy giant has 13 oil fields in the region , and is thought to have about 18 billion barrels of proven oil and gas reserves worldwide .
it is a far cry from the old quip about bp - that their geologists were brilliant at finding oil , but , once found , did not know what to do with it .
bp has reported a 26 % rise in annual profits to $ 16.2bn -lrb- £ 8.7bn -rrb- , after benefiting from high oil prices .
takeover drive " ten years ago the company was producing about 1.5 million barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- of oil and gas , " says jj traynor , an independent oil analyst who has been watching bp for years .
" it was very much based on fields in the uk and north america .
today the company is producing about 4 million bpd - with a truly global spread of production assets . "
so how did this happen ?
deals and takeovers were the main driver of change .
bp doubled its production in 1998 by merging with amoco , a us gas company .
a tie-up with another us firm , arco , and then the russian oil company , tnk , followed .
but earlier attempts to go into russia had failed .
strong partner " the mistake they made was that they had a -lsb- russian -rsb- partner who was not as strong as they thought it would be , not fighting their cause , " says mike richey , editor of the magazine neftecompass which examines russia 's oil industry " that 's the key to operating in russia , you need a good strong partner - or ' krycha ' .
it literally means ' roof ' .
that was a bad experience .
bp had to write down a lot of losses on that . "
" if they -lsb- bp -rsb- do n't voluntarily cough up some of these profits , then government should have a look at whether there should be a windfall profits tax " martin o 'neill , mp but ultimately the lure of russia 's vast oil reserves proved too powerful to resist , and bp 's second attempt to break into the market is beginning to pay off .

but villagers are angered by moves to prevent them cutting down trees in recently created nature reserves .
dozens of species of lemurs inhabit the island the huge indian ocean island is home to some 200,000 plant and animal species - three-quarters of which are found nowhere else and are the product of millions of years of separate evolution since it broke away from africa when the continents first formed .
rolling hills cushioned with thick green forest stretch for miles in every direction .
coniferous trees rub branches with weird , spidery plants .
the sky is awash with multi-coloured tropical birds .
the trees echo with the high pitched squeal of the indri lemur .
but it is not long before the scene gives way to barren , eroded grassland .
in places , the soil erosion is so bad as to leave deep earth-red gashes on the hillsides .
very little grows here and there are no wild animals .
' this has to stop ' environmentalists say traditional " slash-and-burn " farming - where forests are cut down and set ablaze to clear land for planting subsistence crops - is destroying its unique rainforest cover and threatens to kill off its endangered wildlife altogether .
this is our way of life .
if we ca n't cut the forests , we ca n't feed ourselves dimanche dimasy mahatsara chief elder the island 's treasures include dozens of species of lemurs - a family of primates older than the monkey and a distant relative of humans - as well as several endemic birds and a colourful cast of chameleons .
at the world parks congress in south africa in 2003 , president marc ravalomanana delighted conservationists when he pledged to more than triple the size of madagascar 's nature reserves from 1.7m hectares to 6m hectares by the end of 2008 .
" -lsb- there is -rsb- a very strong mandate from the government and from the president himself who is following this through and is setting milestones , " says helen crowley , country director of the new york-based wildlife conservation society .
" he 's been likened to -lsb- former u.s. president -rsb- teddy roosevelt at the start of the last century , who saw his country 's wilderness getting decimated and said : ' this has to stop ' . "
' burning for generations ' but aid workers say putting the plan into action on an island in which three-quarters of people live in abject poverty will be tough .
the government has drawn up a map of the areas it wants to target and has started negotiating with local communities before enforcing any bans on chopping trees .
protecting the land of lemurs a number of steps have been taken to sensitise rural communities about the need to preserve the forests , it says .
but when i went to visit a recently-created forest reserve , in which slash-and-burn farming has been strictly banned , i did n't see too much evidence of locals being consulted .
" our village has been burning forests to plant rice here for generations .
then suddenly they come and tell us we no longer have the right to do this , " said dimanche dimasy , chief elder of mahatsara village , which lies deep inside the eastern mantadia forest reserve .
" this is our way of life .
if we ca n't cut the forests , we ca n't feed ourselves .
" the government want to protect the forests but nobody cares about protecting the peasants who live here . "
conservationists say there are long-term benefits to the poor if they conserve the forests , as the land retains water and nutrients .
soil on land where trees have been cut down quickly erodes away , rendering it useless , so more land soon has to be cleared .
day-to-day needs but government officials say persuading poor farming communities of the value of preserving madagascar 's wild forest needs a fundamental shift in ways of thinking .
it is n't easy to change how people think in the countryside sylvain rabotoarison environment minister " when people are poor they are only thinking of their immediate day-to-day needs , " says environment minister sylvain rabotoarison .
" we need to educate people on why it is important to preserve the environment .
but it is n't easy to change how people think in the countryside - it means changing some very old habits . "
it might also mean finding something else for them to do .
plans are underway to teach better rice growing techniques that increase yields using less land and conservation groups are handing out energy efficient stoves to reduce the need for chopping trees for firewood .

but villagers are angered by moves to prevent them cutting down trees in recently created nature reserves .
dozens of species of lemurs inhabit the island the huge indian ocean island is home to some 200,000 plant and animal species - three-quarters of which are found nowhere else and are the product of millions of years of separate evolution since it broke away from africa when the continents first formed .
rolling hills cushioned with thick green forest stretch for miles in every direction .
coniferous trees rub branches with weird , spidery plants .
the sky is awash with multi-coloured tropical birds .
the trees echo with the high pitched squeal of the indri lemur .
but it is not long before the scene gives way to barren , eroded grassland .
in places , the soil erosion is so bad as to leave deep earth-red gashes on the hillsides .
very little grows here and there are no wild animals .
' this has to stop ' environmentalists say traditional " slash-and-burn " farming - where forests are cut down and set ablaze to clear land for planting subsistence crops - is destroying its unique rainforest cover and threatens to kill off its endangered wildlife altogether .
this is our way of life .
if we ca n't cut the forests , we ca n't feed ourselves dimanche dimasy mahatsara chief elder the island 's treasures include dozens of species of lemurs - a family of primates older than the monkey and a distant relative of humans - as well as several endemic birds and a colourful cast of chameleons .
at the world parks congress in south africa in 2003 , president marc ravalomanana delighted conservationists when he pledged to more than triple the size of madagascar 's nature reserves from 1.7m hectares to 6m hectares by the end of 2008 .
" -lsb- there is -rsb- a very strong mandate from the government and from the president himself who is following this through and is setting milestones , " says helen crowley , country director of the new york-based wildlife conservation society .

' burning for generations ' but aid workers say putting the plan into action on an island in which three-quarters of people live in abject poverty will be tough .
the government has drawn up a map of the areas it wants to target and has started negotiating with local communities before enforcing any bans on chopping trees .
protecting the land of lemurs a number of steps have been taken to sensitise rural communities about the need to preserve the forests , it says .
but when i went to visit a recently-created forest reserve , in which slash-and-burn farming has been strictly banned , i did n't see too much evidence of locals being consulted .
" our village has been burning forests to plant rice here for generations .
then suddenly they come and tell us we no longer have the right to do this , " said dimanche dimasy , chief elder of mahatsara village , which lies deep inside the eastern mantadia forest reserve .
" this is our way of life .
if we ca n't cut the forests , we ca n't feed ourselves .
" the government want to protect the forests but nobody cares about protecting the peasants who live here . "
conservationists say there are long-term benefits to the poor if they conserve the forests , as the land retains water and nutrients .
soil on land where trees have been cut down quickly erodes away , rendering it useless , so more land soon has to be cleared .
day-to-day needs but government officials say persuading poor farming communities of the value of preserving madagascar 's wild forest needs a fundamental shift in ways of thinking .
it is n't easy to change how people think in the countryside sylvain rabotoarison environment minister " when people are poor they are only thinking of their immediate day-to-day needs , " says environment minister sylvain rabotoarison .
" we need to educate people on why it is important to preserve the environment .
but it is n't easy to change how people think in the countryside - it means changing some very old habits . "
it might also mean finding something else for them to do .
plans are underway to teach better rice growing techniques that increase yields using less land and conservation groups are handing out energy efficient stoves to reduce the need for chopping trees for firewood .

i do n't know why .
i wonder if one of them might have frightened him . "

sophie scholl - the final days portrays the final days of the member of the white rose movement .
scholl , 21 , was arrested and beheaded with her brother , hans , in 1943 for distributing leaflets condemning the " abhorrent tyranny " of adolf hitler .
director marc rothemund said : " i have a feeling of responsibility to keep the legacy of the scholls going . "

scholl and other members of the white rose resistance group first started distributing anti-nazi leaflets in the summer of 1942 .
they were arrested as they dropped leaflets at munich university calling for a " day of reckoning " with adolf hitler 's regime .
the film focuses on the six days from scholl 's arrest to the intense trial which saw scholl initially deny the charges and ended with a defiant appearance .
it is one of three german films vying for a top prize at the festival .

asking for forgiveness is not usually the sun 's style .
britain 's top-selling tabloid is more likely to be crowing about its successes than drawing attention to its mistakes .
but in an extraordinary turnabout , executives at the newspaper have spent the past six months on their knees , trying to win forgiveness for what they describe as the biggest mistake in the paper 's history .
on 19 april 1989 , the sun published a front page article claiming to have the real story about what happened during the hillsborough stadium disaster , when 96 liverpool fans were crushed to death during an fa cup semi-final .
called the truth , the article quoted unnamed police to say " some fans " had urinated on the dead , pick pocketed bodies and beat up police officers giving the kiss of life .
but the article was not the truth .
boycott in liverpool , grief over the tragedy turned to hatred .
a boycott of the sun was launched on merseyside and sales of the paper plummeted .
it 's a boycott that has now lasted more than 15 years and cost the paper tens of millions of pounds in lost sales .
james did n't even have a drink that day or been near a pub .
but that 's what we heard ... because mud sticks margaret aspinall many newsagents in the city still refuse to stock it .
" if countries can go to war and be friends in 15 years , then ca n't the sun and the people of merseyside do that as well ? " asks sun managing editor graham dudman .
last summer , mr dudman met in secret with relatives from four hillsborough families in a bid to win their forgiveness .
the meeting was part of a series of delicate negotiations between the paper and the hillsborough family support group that was followed by a bbc documentary crew .
mr dudman 's secret meeting came after the sun 's deal to tell liverpudlian wayne rooney 's life story saw it attacked once again in the city .
' blackest of days ' rooney was slammed for having betrayed his home town by speaking to " the scum " - as the paper is known to many scousers .
" he -lsb- rooney -rsb- was being vilified locally in the papers , on the web and on the radio stations and having abuse hurled at him all for talking to the sun .
" and we thought , ' well , this is getting ridiculous now , so we 'll apologise ' , " says mr dudman .
if countries can go to war and be friends in 15 years , then ca n't the sun and the people of merseyside do that as well ?
graham dudman for the first time since publishing its article , the sun printed a full page apology describing it as the most terrible mistake in its history .
in an editorial last july , it added " our carelessness and thoughtlessness following that blackest of days made the grief of their families and friends even harder to bear . "
but after 15 years , it was time for the city to " move on " .
on merseyside , the apology failed to make any headway .
' mud sticks ' it was widely attacked as insincere and seen simply as a ploy to sell more papers .
moreover , many of the hillsborough families feel they have never got justice for the death of their loved ones and blame the sun for having turned public opinion against them .
" people believe what they read .
when we had the trial all we heard was drink , drink , drink , " says margaret aspinall , whose 18-year-old son james died at hillsborough .
" james did n't even have a drink that day or been near a pub .
but that 's what we heard . because mud sticks .
that article made me have to defend my son . "
liverpudlian wayne rooney was vilified for talking to the sun undeterred , mr dudman travelled to liverpool to try to put his case in person to the hillsborough family support group .
margaret aspinall and members of three other hillsborough families agreed to meet with him informally .
his appeal for forgiveness included an offer to campaign for justice on their behalf - but only if the group would accept the apology .
after much persuasion , the four family members agreed to put his appeal to the group as a whole .
six weeks later , mr dudman travelled again to liverpool to wait in a nearby hotel room while the support group met at anfield .

asking for forgiveness is not usually the sun 's style .
britain 's top-selling tabloid is more likely to be crowing about its successes than drawing attention to its mistakes .
but in an extraordinary turnabout , executives at the newspaper have spent the past six months on their knees , trying to win forgiveness for what they describe as the biggest mistake in the paper 's history .
on 19 april 1989 , the sun published a front page article claiming to have the real story about what happened during the hillsborough stadium disaster , when 96 liverpool fans were crushed to death during an fa cup semi-final .
called the truth , the article quoted unnamed police to say " some fans " had urinated on the dead , pick pocketed bodies and beat up police officers giving the kiss of life .
but the article was not the truth .
boycott in liverpool , grief over the tragedy turned to hatred .
a boycott of the sun was launched on merseyside and sales of the paper plummeted .
it 's a boycott that has now lasted more than 15 years and cost the paper tens of millions of pounds in lost sales .
james did n't even have a drink that day or been near a pub .
but that 's what we heard ... because mud sticks margaret aspinall many newsagents in the city still refuse to stock it .
" if countries can go to war and be friends in 15 years , then ca n't the sun and the people of merseyside do that as well ? " asks sun managing editor graham dudman .
last summer , mr dudman met in secret with relatives from four hillsborough families in a bid to win their forgiveness .
the meeting was part of a series of delicate negotiations between the paper and the hillsborough family support group that was followed by a bbc documentary crew .
mr dudman 's secret meeting came after the sun 's deal to tell liverpudlian wayne rooney 's life story saw it attacked once again in the city .
' blackest of days ' rooney was slammed for having betrayed his home town by speaking to " the scum " - as the paper is known to many scousers .
" he -lsb- rooney -rsb- was being vilified locally in the papers , on the web and on the radio stations and having abuse hurled at him all for talking to the sun .
" and we thought , ' well , this is getting ridiculous now , so we 'll apologise ' , " says mr dudman .
if countries can go to war and be friends in 15 years , then ca n't the sun and the people of merseyside do that as well ?
graham dudman for the first time since publishing its article , the sun printed a full page apology describing it as the most terrible mistake in its history .
in an editorial last july , it added " our carelessness and thoughtlessness following that blackest of days made the grief of their families and friends even harder to bear . "
but after 15 years , it was time for the city to " move on " .
on merseyside , the apology failed to make any headway .
' mud sticks ' it was widely attacked as insincere and seen simply as a ploy to sell more papers .
moreover , many of the hillsborough families feel they have never got justice for the death of their loved ones and blame the sun for having turned public opinion against them .
" people believe what they read .
when we had the trial all we heard was drink , drink , drink , " says margaret aspinall , whose 18-year-old son james died at hillsborough .
" james did n't even have a drink that day or been near a pub .
but that 's what we heard . because mud sticks .
that article made me have to defend my son . "
liverpudlian wayne rooney was vilified for talking to the sun undeterred , mr dudman travelled to liverpool to try to put his case in person to the hillsborough family support group .
margaret aspinall and members of three other hillsborough families agreed to meet with him informally .
his appeal for forgiveness included an offer to campaign for justice on their behalf - but only if the group would accept the apology .
after much persuasion , the four family members agreed to put his appeal to the group as a whole .
six weeks later , mr dudman travelled again to liverpool to wait in a nearby hotel room while the support group met at anfield .
but they voted to refuse him an audience .
the rejection of its apology is a major setback for the sun 's attempts to rehabilitate itself in liverpudlian eyes and to win back lost sales on merseyside .
and it 's clear that it has a considerable way to go to convince many merseysiders of its sincerity .

curators and other workers at the science museum in london will take part in the protest over a below-inflation wage offer and cost-cutting measures .
the national railway museum in york and the national museum of photography , film and television in bradford will also be hit by the action .
the strike comes midway during school half-term holidays .
staff have rejected a 2.5 % pay offer , which unions say was below inflation and " derisory " .
catherine craig , negotiations officer for the public and commercial services union , said : " our members are left with no option but to strike .
" any inconvenience caused is regrettable and we would advise people planning visits to the museums affected to visit on an alternative day . "
' financial crisis ' prospect union negotiator emily boase said : " our members care passionately about the museum and having a real-terms cut in their wages is bad enough .
" but they feel this derisory offer , which reneges on previous pay promises , is indicative of the wider financial crisis facing the museum which threatens the fabric of the exhibits and the services that the public have a right to expect .
" world-class museums do not come on the cheap but simply relying on the goodwill of staff is no longer an option . "
the national museum of science and industry -lrb- nmsi -rrb- runs the three museums , and said that while the science museum would close , the other two would remain open on wednesday .
dr lindsay sharp , nmsi director , said : " we are disappointed at the decision to take strike action .
" at the same time , we are sympathetic to the circumstances which have led many to consider this action necessary .
however , nmsi simply can not afford to improve upon the offer of 2.5 % .
" the science museum , nrm and nmpft are not art galleries .
looking at paintings does n't wear them out but intensive use of interactives to inspire and involve children and families costs a very great deal to maintain and repair .
" we have invested heavily in our staff over the past few years to raise their pay from near the bottom to the median for our sector . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- warcraft sets gaming standards home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 14 february , 2005 , 10:49 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version warcraft sets gaming standards by phil elliott bbc news technology staff take your character out into the world of warcraft massively multiplayer roleplaying games - or mmorpgs - have been around for a while now , but recent releases have demonstrated that they are making the crucial transition from a niche to a mass-market audience .
in late 2004 when world of warcraft was released in north america it broke a number of records for the genre - including first day sales and concurrent users .
now it is europe 's turn to experience azeroth on developer blizzard 's new set of region-dedicated servers .
the first thing that strikes you about world of warcraft is just how easy it is to pick up and play .
most games of this type tend to require a great deal of attention and dedication to play , but in this case it is possible to enjoy the game in relatively short bursts - perfect for the more casual gamer .
read a selection of your views on world of warcraft you play the game through your on-screen character - or avatar - and as usual your overriding task in the game is to " level up " - in other words improve your character by gaining experience .
world of warcraft format : pc graphics : 9 sound : 8 game play : 10 enduring appeal : 10 overall : 9.5 designing that character is very simple and you do not need to worry about statistic points for strength , dexterity , etc .
instead you simply choose which side of the moral divide you wish to be on - the alliance or the horde - and then one of the four available races in each side .
plus there are a host of different professions as well -lrb- warrior , shaman , hunter , etc -rrb- , each with different attributes .
once you are in , the world around you is impressive .
the graphics are not what you would call realistic , but the quality and consistency of the artwork around you , as well as the attention to detail , renders that immaterial .
there are a whole range of different types of countryside , from icy mountains to barren deserts , thick rainforests to grassy savannahs .
each has its own consistent palette and each is sumptuous to look at .
graphics are impressive for a mmorpg an issue common to mmorpgs is scope .
when you are confronted by an entire virtual world , with few limitations on where and what you can go and do , it is difficult to know where to begin .
world or warcraft does a very good job of giving your time in azeroth some structure , without making the experience linear .
available quests are clearly marked , and these quests do a very good job of guiding you to suitable areas of content , which expand and develop along with your character .
as a result you do not feel out of your depth , unless you intentionally wander off into high level areas both solo and group quests play a big part of world of warcraft , and whilst the different servers are dedicated to different types of action -lrb- pve : player vs environment - and pvp : player vs player -rrb- the majority of battles take place against computer-controlled monsters .
the player vs player elements are effectively restricted to alliance vs horde encounters , but it is possible to fight anybody in a duel , although there are no ill effects sustained from losing such a bout .
combat forms a core part of the game play overall world of warcraft is very difficult to sum up in such a short space .
it is a joy to behold , and a joy to play .
the usual monotony of " grinding " experience points in order to level up is very rarely to be seen as new areas and challenges are being uncovered all the time .
and with the exception of specific high-level dungeons , or cross-continent travel , there are no loading times to speak of .
if you are a casual gamer in need of a new challenge , or an experienced mmorpg-er wanting another world to sink your teeth into , world of warcraft could very well be exactly what you 're looking for .
it is the best mmorpg to date , and could well be for some time .
read a selection of your views on the game .
if your idea of fun , is clicking the same button all day to defeat a predictable computer controlled opponent , then this game is for you .
if you like that kind of thing but do n't want to pay a subscription then try neverwinter nights .
if you want actual team competition then you are better off trying shadowbane , quake or counter strike .
nick , london , uk i 'm starting to crack up here !
whilst i played -lrb- and loved the beta -rrb- i 'm rapidly loosing patience with the official release .
i 've been trying to register for over four hours now .
this is so far from professional it 's beyond a joke .
a fact that is only compounded after the problems encountered back when the game was launched in the us .
surely blizzard should have learned ?
chris , belfast i 've been hooked up to that game since late december and i must say it is really amazing .
as a somewhat hardcore online rpg player who grew up on muds , i found myself " at home " with wow .
my wife got sucked into the wow 's world as well , and she enjoys playing it as much as i do .
vaza , uldum realm almost everyone who purchased this game today has been left with an unusable product thanks to the account creation servers being taken down .
the servers were not able to handle the amount of incoming traffic .
this happened when the game was released in america , and blizzard should have been prepared for it happening here too .
alasdair mackenzie , cumbernauld , scotland i was on the beta of this and loved every minute .
i received my pre order today and guess what ?
the servers are down and i ca n't create and account .
the lucky few who managed to create an account this morning are also having problems with lag ! adam graham , sunderland unfortunately , it is certain at this point that blizzard has learned little from it 's american experience .
as we speak , world of warcraft account creation pages are down ; they went down even before peak hours on the first day of release .
further , there are queues to enter all servers , meaning that even if you manage to give blizzard your credit card details , you have to wait to play the game you purchased .
at this point it is a given that the game will be a hit , but blizzard will need to make massive changes to maintain it 's reputation .
alex , cambridge before world of warcraft i had naver played any other mmorpgs mostly due to the pricy monthly subscription fees , but after taking a chance with world of warcraft i would say that the monthly fee is well worth it .
i first got the game for christmas and being a sixteen year old i must say that it has beed severely detrimental to my social life .
zach , chicago , illinois , usa since around 2pm nobody who purchased the game can actually register to play ! !
john smoth , east midlands happy to see europe is now getting their turn with this game .
world of warcraft will keep you hooked hard , however , so i would n't recommend picking it up if you 're on a tight schedule . ; -rrb- garrett walters , colorado , usa the account creating servers have been down nearly all day and it is impossible to start the game without creating one .
blizzard knew how many people were wanting to play this game but they were too cheap to set up a system to cope with the influx of players .
robert sutton , halifax , england i played the beta , which closed on monday evening and have been like a big kid waiting for christmas ever since .
got the retail game today and ca n't wait to finish work .
this game is the best and sets a new high for other developers to aim for .
paul slade , bournemouth , england a friend of mine got world of warcraft in the post this morning , he disapeared into his room and i have n't seen him since ! !
but the person i really do feel sorry for is his girlfriend .
who scheduled the release of this wretched game three days before valentines day ?
becky , london what i 've seen has been a massive improvement on other mmorpg 's including npc traders that give a sample price for trading so prices dont go crazy in the player economy .
mine will be arriving tomorrow and i 'm definitely playing an orc .
neil shaw , doncaster , uk this game is addictive .
seriously .
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair .
you 'll love this game so much that you will hate what it does with your spare time .
just a warning to those with a strict time schedule who are interested in this game : keep track of time .
travis anderson , mcallen , texas it 's not for serious mmorpgers in my opinion - i 've simply bought the game for when everquest 2 is offline .
everquest 2 is by far a more complete package .
mike bowling , leeds this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it .
charles macintyre , england i love world of warcraft .
i 'm a long time fan of everquest and later planetside but neither compare to the playability and sheer joy of this game .
all races and classes can be played solo and grinding is at a minimum .
as a 50-something clergyman i have to keep my new passion somewhat of a secret at work but in my time off i am openly a gnome magician ! -lrb- lvl 35 -rrb- who could ask for more .
david boyer , boston massachusetts , usa i was really excited about world of warcraft until i learnt that it would be subscription based .
blizzard and the other mmorpg game manufacturers need to seriously look at their pricing if they ever want to truly go mass market .
where is the pay as you go pricing model ? david , london , england i was really impressed with the look , detail and the little things like when you walk through a thick forest it is actually a thick forest , not just a handful of tress visible at any one time .
the game was straight forward without the abiguity i 've seen in others and when you went to do something in did n't turn into final fantasy -lrb- which is a good thing unless you 're an account and love stats -rrb- .
i wo n't play this but if more of this type comes out i might get tempted away from counter-strike for minutes at a time .
richard , brighton normally i stick to first person shooters , but i must say after participating in the european beta , world of warcraft definitely hooked me enough to buy it .
the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .
it 's an absolutely fantastic game , and is about the only mmorpg which has managed to hold my interest for more than a week or two .
i think it works so well simply becasue the world it 's based on has almost evolved instead of being written in a week or so .
warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .
as a seasoned gamer i can honestly say i have n't found anything that i would change .
it is amazing .
well done blizzard you 've got another hit on your hands ! !
vanella mead , southampton uk i have been playing in the closed european beta and i expect my copy to arrive this morning .
world of warcraft is a extremely fun game to play .

in late 2004 when world of warcraft was released in north america it broke a number of records for the genre - including first day sales and concurrent users .
now it is europe 's turn to experience azeroth on developer blizzard 's new set of region-dedicated servers .
the first thing that strikes you about world of warcraft is just how easy it is to pick up and play .
most games of this type tend to require a great deal of attention and dedication to play , but in this case it is possible to enjoy the game in relatively short bursts - perfect for the more casual gamer .
read a selection of your views on world of warcraft you play the game through your on-screen character - or avatar - and as usual your overriding task in the game is to " level up " - in other words improve your character by gaining experience .
world of warcraft format : pc graphics : 9 sound : 8 game play : 10 enduring appeal : 10 overall : 9.5 designing that character is very simple and you do not need to worry about statistic points for strength , dexterity , etc .
instead you simply choose which side of the moral divide you wish to be on - the alliance or the horde - and then one of the four available races in each side .
plus there are a host of different professions as well -lrb- warrior , shaman , hunter , etc -rrb- , each with different attributes .
once you are in , the world around you is impressive .
the graphics are not what you would call realistic , but the quality and consistency of the artwork around you , as well as the attention to detail , renders that immaterial .
there are a whole range of different types of countryside , from icy mountains to barren deserts , thick rainforests to grassy savannahs .
each has its own consistent palette and each is sumptuous to look at .
graphics are impressive for a mmorpg an issue common to mmorpgs is scope .
when you are confronted by an entire virtual world , with few limitations on where and what you can go and do , it is difficult to know where to begin .
world or warcraft does a very good job of giving your time in azeroth some structure , without making the experience linear .
available quests are clearly marked , and these quests do a very good job of guiding you to suitable areas of content , which expand and develop along with your character .
as a result you do not feel out of your depth , unless you intentionally wander off into high level areas both solo and group quests play a big part of world of warcraft , and whilst the different servers are dedicated to different types of action -lrb- pve : player vs environment - and pvp : player vs player -rrb- the majority of battles take place against computer-controlled monsters .
the player vs player elements are effectively restricted to alliance vs horde encounters , but it is possible to fight anybody in a duel , although there are no ill effects sustained from losing such a bout .
combat forms a core part of the game play overall world of warcraft is very difficult to sum up in such a short space .
it is a joy to behold , and a joy to play .
the usual monotony of " grinding " experience points in order to level up is very rarely to be seen as new areas and challenges are being uncovered all the time .
and with the exception of specific high-level dungeons , or cross-continent travel , there are no loading times to speak of .
if you are a casual gamer in need of a new challenge , or an experienced mmorpg-er wanting another world to sink your teeth into , world of warcraft could very well be exactly what you 're looking for .
it is the best mmorpg to date , and could well be for some time .
read a selection of your views on the game .
if your idea of fun , is clicking the same button all day to defeat a predictable computer controlled opponent , then this game is for you .
if you like that kind of thing but do n't want to pay a subscription then try neverwinter nights .
if you want actual team competition then you are better off trying shadowbane , quake or counter strike .
nick , london , uk i 'm starting to crack up here !
whilst i played -lrb- and loved the beta -rrb- i 'm rapidly loosing patience with the official release .
i 've been trying to register for over four hours now .
this is so far from professional it 's beyond a joke .
a fact that is only compounded after the problems encountered back when the game was launched in the us .
surely blizzard should have learned ?
chris , belfast i 've been hooked up to that game since late december and i must say it is really amazing .
as a somewhat hardcore online rpg player who grew up on muds , i found myself " at home " with wow .
my wife got sucked into the wow 's world as well , and she enjoys playing it as much as i do .
vaza , uldum realm almost everyone who purchased this game today has been left with an unusable product thanks to the account creation servers being taken down .
the servers were not able to handle the amount of incoming traffic .
this happened when the game was released in america , and blizzard should have been prepared for it happening here too .
alasdair mackenzie , cumbernauld , scotland i was on the beta of this and loved every minute .
i received my pre order today and guess what ?
the servers are down and i ca n't create and account .
the lucky few who managed to create an account this morning are also having problems with lag ! adam graham , sunderland unfortunately , it is certain at this point that blizzard has learned little from it 's american experience .
as we speak , world of warcraft account creation pages are down ; they went down even before peak hours on the first day of release .
further , there are queues to enter all servers , meaning that even if you manage to give blizzard your credit card details , you have to wait to play the game you purchased .
at this point it is a given that the game will be a hit , but blizzard will need to make massive changes to maintain it 's reputation .
alex , cambridge before world of warcraft i had naver played any other mmorpgs mostly due to the pricy monthly subscription fees , but after taking a chance with world of warcraft i would say that the monthly fee is well worth it .
i first got the game for christmas and being a sixteen year old i must say that it has beed severely detrimental to my social life .
zach , chicago , illinois , usa since around 2pm nobody who purchased the game can actually register to play ! !
john smoth , east midlands happy to see europe is now getting their turn with this game .
world of warcraft will keep you hooked hard , however , so i would n't recommend picking it up if you 're on a tight schedule . ; -rrb- garrett walters , colorado , usa the account creating servers have been down nearly all day and it is impossible to start the game without creating one .
blizzard knew how many people were wanting to play this game but they were too cheap to set up a system to cope with the influx of players .
robert sutton , halifax , england i played the beta , which closed on monday evening and have been like a big kid waiting for christmas ever since .
got the retail game today and ca n't wait to finish work .
this game is the best and sets a new high for other developers to aim for .
paul slade , bournemouth , england a friend of mine got world of warcraft in the post this morning , he disapeared into his room and i have n't seen him since ! !
but the person i really do feel sorry for is his girlfriend .
who scheduled the release of this wretched game three days before valentines day ?
becky , london what i 've seen has been a massive improvement on other mmorpg 's including npc traders that give a sample price for trading so prices dont go crazy in the player economy .
mine will be arriving tomorrow and i 'm definitely playing an orc .
neil shaw , doncaster , uk this game is addictive .
seriously .
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair .
you 'll love this game so much that you will hate what it does with your spare time .
just a warning to those with a strict time schedule who are interested in this game : keep track of time .
travis anderson , mcallen , texas it 's not for serious mmorpgers in my opinion - i 've simply bought the game for when everquest 2 is offline .
everquest 2 is by far a more complete package .
mike bowling , leeds this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it .
charles macintyre , england i love world of warcraft .
i 'm a long time fan of everquest and later planetside but neither compare to the playability and sheer joy of this game .
all races and classes can be played solo and grinding is at a minimum .
as a 50-something clergyman i have to keep my new passion somewhat of a secret at work but in my time off i am openly a gnome magician ! -lrb- lvl 35 -rrb- who could ask for more .
david boyer , boston massachusetts , usa i was really excited about world of warcraft until i learnt that it would be subscription based .
blizzard and the other mmorpg game manufacturers need to seriously look at their pricing if they ever want to truly go mass market .
where is the pay as you go pricing model ? david , london , england i was really impressed with the look , detail and the little things like when you walk through a thick forest it is actually a thick forest , not just a handful of tress visible at any one time .
the game was straight forward without the abiguity i 've seen in others and when you went to do something in did n't turn into final fantasy -lrb- which is a good thing unless you 're an account and love stats -rrb- .
i wo n't play this but if more of this type comes out i might get tempted away from counter-strike for minutes at a time .
richard , brighton normally i stick to first person shooters , but i must say after participating in the european beta , world of warcraft definitely hooked me enough to buy it .
the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .
it 's an absolutely fantastic game , and is about the only mmorpg which has managed to hold my interest for more than a week or two .
i think it works so well simply becasue the world it 's based on has almost evolved instead of being written in a week or so .
warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .

fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .
as a seasoned gamer i can honestly say i have n't found anything that i would change .
it is amazing .
well done blizzard you 've got another hit on your hands ! !
vanella mead , southampton uk i have been playing in the closed european beta and i expect my copy to arrive this morning .

in late 2004 when world of warcraft was released in north america it broke a number of records for the genre - including first day sales and concurrent users .
now it is europe 's turn to experience azeroth on developer blizzard 's new set of region-dedicated servers .
the first thing that strikes you about world of warcraft is just how easy it is to pick up and play .
most games of this type tend to require a great deal of attention and dedication to play , but in this case it is possible to enjoy the game in relatively short bursts - perfect for the more casual gamer .
read a selection of your views on world of warcraft you play the game through your on-screen character - or avatar - and as usual your overriding task in the game is to " level up " - in other words improve your character by gaining experience .
world of warcraft format : pc graphics : 9 sound : 8 game play : 10 enduring appeal : 10 overall : 9.5 designing that character is very simple and you do not need to worry about statistic points for strength , dexterity , etc .
instead you simply choose which side of the moral divide you wish to be on - the alliance or the horde - and then one of the four available races in each side .
plus there are a host of different professions as well -lrb- warrior , shaman , hunter , etc -rrb- , each with different attributes .
once you are in , the world around you is impressive .
the graphics are not what you would call realistic , but the quality and consistency of the artwork around you , as well as the attention to detail , renders that immaterial .
there are a whole range of different types of countryside , from icy mountains to barren deserts , thick rainforests to grassy savannahs .
each has its own consistent palette and each is sumptuous to look at .
graphics are impressive for a mmorpg an issue common to mmorpgs is scope .
when you are confronted by an entire virtual world , with few limitations on where and what you can go and do , it is difficult to know where to begin .
world or warcraft does a very good job of giving your time in azeroth some structure , without making the experience linear .
available quests are clearly marked , and these quests do a very good job of guiding you to suitable areas of content , which expand and develop along with your character .
as a result you do not feel out of your depth , unless you intentionally wander off into high level areas both solo and group quests play a big part of world of warcraft , and whilst the different servers are dedicated to different types of action -lrb- pve : player vs environment - and pvp : player vs player -rrb- the majority of battles take place against computer-controlled monsters .
the player vs player elements are effectively restricted to alliance vs horde encounters , but it is possible to fight anybody in a duel , although there are no ill effects sustained from losing such a bout .
combat forms a core part of the game play overall world of warcraft is very difficult to sum up in such a short space .
it is a joy to behold , and a joy to play .
the usual monotony of " grinding " experience points in order to level up is very rarely to be seen as new areas and challenges are being uncovered all the time .
and with the exception of specific high-level dungeons , or cross-continent travel , there are no loading times to speak of .
if you are a casual gamer in need of a new challenge , or an experienced mmorpg-er wanting another world to sink your teeth into , world of warcraft could very well be exactly what you 're looking for .
it is the best mmorpg to date , and could well be for some time .
read a selection of your views on the game .
if your idea of fun , is clicking the same button all day to defeat a predictable computer controlled opponent , then this game is for you .
if you like that kind of thing but do n't want to pay a subscription then try neverwinter nights .
if you want actual team competition then you are better off trying shadowbane , quake or counter strike .
nick , london , uk i 'm starting to crack up here !
whilst i played -lrb- and loved the beta -rrb- i 'm rapidly loosing patience with the official release .
i 've been trying to register for over four hours now .
this is so far from professional it 's beyond a joke .
a fact that is only compounded after the problems encountered back when the game was launched in the us .
surely blizzard should have learned ?
chris , belfast i 've been hooked up to that game since late december and i must say it is really amazing .
as a somewhat hardcore online rpg player who grew up on muds , i found myself " at home " with wow .
my wife got sucked into the wow 's world as well , and she enjoys playing it as much as i do .
vaza , uldum realm almost everyone who purchased this game today has been left with an unusable product thanks to the account creation servers being taken down .
the servers were not able to handle the amount of incoming traffic .
this happened when the game was released in america , and blizzard should have been prepared for it happening here too .
alasdair mackenzie , cumbernauld , scotland i was on the beta of this and loved every minute .
i received my pre order today and guess what ?
the servers are down and i ca n't create and account .
the lucky few who managed to create an account this morning are also having problems with lag ! adam graham , sunderland unfortunately , it is certain at this point that blizzard has learned little from it 's american experience .
as we speak , world of warcraft account creation pages are down ; they went down even before peak hours on the first day of release .
further , there are queues to enter all servers , meaning that even if you manage to give blizzard your credit card details , you have to wait to play the game you purchased .
at this point it is a given that the game will be a hit , but blizzard will need to make massive changes to maintain it 's reputation .
alex , cambridge before world of warcraft i had naver played any other mmorpgs mostly due to the pricy monthly subscription fees , but after taking a chance with world of warcraft i would say that the monthly fee is well worth it .
i first got the game for christmas and being a sixteen year old i must say that it has beed severely detrimental to my social life .
zach , chicago , illinois , usa since around 2pm nobody who purchased the game can actually register to play ! !
john smoth , east midlands happy to see europe is now getting their turn with this game .
world of warcraft will keep you hooked hard , however , so i would n't recommend picking it up if you 're on a tight schedule . ; -rrb- garrett walters , colorado , usa the account creating servers have been down nearly all day and it is impossible to start the game without creating one .
blizzard knew how many people were wanting to play this game but they were too cheap to set up a system to cope with the influx of players .
robert sutton , halifax , england i played the beta , which closed on monday evening and have been like a big kid waiting for christmas ever since .
got the retail game today and ca n't wait to finish work .
this game is the best and sets a new high for other developers to aim for .
paul slade , bournemouth , england a friend of mine got world of warcraft in the post this morning , he disapeared into his room and i have n't seen him since ! !
but the person i really do feel sorry for is his girlfriend .
who scheduled the release of this wretched game three days before valentines day ?
becky , london what i 've seen has been a massive improvement on other mmorpg 's including npc traders that give a sample price for trading so prices dont go crazy in the player economy .
mine will be arriving tomorrow and i 'm definitely playing an orc .
neil shaw , doncaster , uk this game is addictive .
seriously .
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair .
you 'll love this game so much that you will hate what it does with your spare time .
just a warning to those with a strict time schedule who are interested in this game : keep track of time .
travis anderson , mcallen , texas it 's not for serious mmorpgers in my opinion - i 've simply bought the game for when everquest 2 is offline .
everquest 2 is by far a more complete package .
mike bowling , leeds this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it .
charles macintyre , england i love world of warcraft .
i 'm a long time fan of everquest and later planetside but neither compare to the playability and sheer joy of this game .
all races and classes can be played solo and grinding is at a minimum .
as a 50-something clergyman i have to keep my new passion somewhat of a secret at work but in my time off i am openly a gnome magician ! -lrb- lvl 35 -rrb- who could ask for more .
david boyer , boston massachusetts , usa i was really excited about world of warcraft until i learnt that it would be subscription based .
blizzard and the other mmorpg game manufacturers need to seriously look at their pricing if they ever want to truly go mass market .
where is the pay as you go pricing model ? david , london , england i was really impressed with the look , detail and the little things like when you walk through a thick forest it is actually a thick forest , not just a handful of tress visible at any one time .
the game was straight forward without the abiguity i 've seen in others and when you went to do something in did n't turn into final fantasy -lrb- which is a good thing unless you 're an account and love stats -rrb- .
i wo n't play this but if more of this type comes out i might get tempted away from counter-strike for minutes at a time .
richard , brighton normally i stick to first person shooters , but i must say after participating in the european beta , world of warcraft definitely hooked me enough to buy it .
the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .
it 's an absolutely fantastic game , and is about the only mmorpg which has managed to hold my interest for more than a week or two .
i think it works so well simply becasue the world it 's based on has almost evolved instead of being written in a week or so .
warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .

the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .
as a seasoned gamer i can honestly say i have n't found anything that i would change .
it is amazing .
well done blizzard you 've got another hit on your hands ! !
vanella mead , southampton uk i have been playing in the closed european beta and i expect my copy to arrive this morning .
world of warcraft is a extremely fun game to play .

in late 2004 when world of warcraft was released in north america it broke a number of records for the genre - including first day sales and concurrent users .
now it is europe 's turn to experience azeroth on developer blizzard 's new set of region-dedicated servers .
the first thing that strikes you about world of warcraft is just how easy it is to pick up and play .
most games of this type tend to require a great deal of attention and dedication to play , but in this case it is possible to enjoy the game in relatively short bursts - perfect for the more casual gamer .
read a selection of your views on world of warcraft you play the game through your on-screen character - or avatar - and as usual your overriding task in the game is to " level up " - in other words improve your character by gaining experience .
world of warcraft format : pc graphics : 9 sound : 8 game play : 10 enduring appeal : 10 overall : 9.5 designing that character is very simple and you do not need to worry about statistic points for strength , dexterity , etc .
instead you simply choose which side of the moral divide you wish to be on - the alliance or the horde - and then one of the four available races in each side .
plus there are a host of different professions as well -lrb- warrior , shaman , hunter , etc -rrb- , each with different attributes .
once you are in , the world around you is impressive .
the graphics are not what you would call realistic , but the quality and consistency of the artwork around you , as well as the attention to detail , renders that immaterial .
there are a whole range of different types of countryside , from icy mountains to barren deserts , thick rainforests to grassy savannahs .
each has its own consistent palette and each is sumptuous to look at .
graphics are impressive for a mmorpg an issue common to mmorpgs is scope .
when you are confronted by an entire virtual world , with few limitations on where and what you can go and do , it is difficult to know where to begin .
world or warcraft does a very good job of giving your time in azeroth some structure , without making the experience linear .
available quests are clearly marked , and these quests do a very good job of guiding you to suitable areas of content , which expand and develop along with your character .
as a result you do not feel out of your depth , unless you intentionally wander off into high level areas both solo and group quests play a big part of world of warcraft , and whilst the different servers are dedicated to different types of action -lrb- pve : player vs environment - and pvp : player vs player -rrb- the majority of battles take place against computer-controlled monsters .
the player vs player elements are effectively restricted to alliance vs horde encounters , but it is possible to fight anybody in a duel , although there are no ill effects sustained from losing such a bout .
combat forms a core part of the game play overall world of warcraft is very difficult to sum up in such a short space .
it is a joy to behold , and a joy to play .
the usual monotony of " grinding " experience points in order to level up is very rarely to be seen as new areas and challenges are being uncovered all the time .
and with the exception of specific high-level dungeons , or cross-continent travel , there are no loading times to speak of .
if you are a casual gamer in need of a new challenge , or an experienced mmorpg-er wanting another world to sink your teeth into , world of warcraft could very well be exactly what you 're looking for .
it is the best mmorpg to date , and could well be for some time .
read a selection of your views on the game .
if your idea of fun , is clicking the same button all day to defeat a predictable computer controlled opponent , then this game is for you .
if you like that kind of thing but do n't want to pay a subscription then try neverwinter nights .
if you want actual team competition then you are better off trying shadowbane , quake or counter strike .
nick , london , uk i 'm starting to crack up here !
whilst i played -lrb- and loved the beta -rrb- i 'm rapidly loosing patience with the official release .
i 've been trying to register for over four hours now .
this is so far from professional it 's beyond a joke .
a fact that is only compounded after the problems encountered back when the game was launched in the us .
surely blizzard should have learned ?
chris , belfast i 've been hooked up to that game since late december and i must say it is really amazing .
as a somewhat hardcore online rpg player who grew up on muds , i found myself " at home " with wow .
my wife got sucked into the wow 's world as well , and she enjoys playing it as much as i do .
vaza , uldum realm almost everyone who purchased this game today has been left with an unusable product thanks to the account creation servers being taken down .
the servers were not able to handle the amount of incoming traffic .
this happened when the game was released in america , and blizzard should have been prepared for it happening here too .
alasdair mackenzie , cumbernauld , scotland i was on the beta of this and loved every minute .
i received my pre order today and guess what ?
the servers are down and i ca n't create and account .
the lucky few who managed to create an account this morning are also having problems with lag ! adam graham , sunderland unfortunately , it is certain at this point that blizzard has learned little from it 's american experience .
as we speak , world of warcraft account creation pages are down ; they went down even before peak hours on the first day of release .
further , there are queues to enter all servers , meaning that even if you manage to give blizzard your credit card details , you have to wait to play the game you purchased .
at this point it is a given that the game will be a hit , but blizzard will need to make massive changes to maintain it 's reputation .
alex , cambridge before world of warcraft i had naver played any other mmorpgs mostly due to the pricy monthly subscription fees , but after taking a chance with world of warcraft i would say that the monthly fee is well worth it .
i first got the game for christmas and being a sixteen year old i must say that it has beed severely detrimental to my social life .
zach , chicago , illinois , usa since around 2pm nobody who purchased the game can actually register to play ! !
john smoth , east midlands happy to see europe is now getting their turn with this game .
world of warcraft will keep you hooked hard , however , so i would n't recommend picking it up if you 're on a tight schedule . ; -rrb- garrett walters , colorado , usa the account creating servers have been down nearly all day and it is impossible to start the game without creating one .
blizzard knew how many people were wanting to play this game but they were too cheap to set up a system to cope with the influx of players .
robert sutton , halifax , england i played the beta , which closed on monday evening and have been like a big kid waiting for christmas ever since .
got the retail game today and ca n't wait to finish work .
this game is the best and sets a new high for other developers to aim for .
paul slade , bournemouth , england a friend of mine got world of warcraft in the post this morning , he disapeared into his room and i have n't seen him since ! !
but the person i really do feel sorry for is his girlfriend .
who scheduled the release of this wretched game three days before valentines day ?
becky , london what i 've seen has been a massive improvement on other mmorpg 's including npc traders that give a sample price for trading so prices dont go crazy in the player economy .
mine will be arriving tomorrow and i 'm definitely playing an orc .
neil shaw , doncaster , uk this game is addictive .
seriously .
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair .
you 'll love this game so much that you will hate what it does with your spare time .
just a warning to those with a strict time schedule who are interested in this game : keep track of time .
travis anderson , mcallen , texas it 's not for serious mmorpgers in my opinion - i 've simply bought the game for when everquest 2 is offline .
everquest 2 is by far a more complete package .
mike bowling , leeds this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it .
charles macintyre , england i love world of warcraft .
i 'm a long time fan of everquest and later planetside but neither compare to the playability and sheer joy of this game .
all races and classes can be played solo and grinding is at a minimum .
as a 50-something clergyman i have to keep my new passion somewhat of a secret at work but in my time off i am openly a gnome magician ! -lrb- lvl 35 -rrb- who could ask for more .
david boyer , boston massachusetts , usa i was really excited about world of warcraft until i learnt that it would be subscription based .
blizzard and the other mmorpg game manufacturers need to seriously look at their pricing if they ever want to truly go mass market .
where is the pay as you go pricing model ? david , london , england i was really impressed with the look , detail and the little things like when you walk through a thick forest it is actually a thick forest , not just a handful of tress visible at any one time .
the game was straight forward without the abiguity i 've seen in others and when you went to do something in did n't turn into final fantasy -lrb- which is a good thing unless you 're an account and love stats -rrb- .
i wo n't play this but if more of this type comes out i might get tempted away from counter-strike for minutes at a time .
richard , brighton normally i stick to first person shooters , but i must say after participating in the european beta , world of warcraft definitely hooked me enough to buy it .
the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .
it 's an absolutely fantastic game , and is about the only mmorpg which has managed to hold my interest for more than a week or two .
i think it works so well simply becasue the world it 's based on has almost evolved instead of being written in a week or so .
warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .

warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .
as a seasoned gamer i can honestly say i have n't found anything that i would change .
it is amazing .
well done blizzard you 've got another hit on your hands ! !
vanella mead , southampton uk i have been playing in the closed european beta and i expect my copy to arrive this morning .
world of warcraft is a extremely fun game to play .

in late 2004 when world of warcraft was released in north america it broke a number of records for the genre - including first day sales and concurrent users .
now it is europe 's turn to experience azeroth on developer blizzard 's new set of region-dedicated servers .
the first thing that strikes you about world of warcraft is just how easy it is to pick up and play .
most games of this type tend to require a great deal of attention and dedication to play , but in this case it is possible to enjoy the game in relatively short bursts - perfect for the more casual gamer .
read a selection of your views on world of warcraft you play the game through your on-screen character - or avatar - and as usual your overriding task in the game is to " level up " - in other words improve your character by gaining experience .
world of warcraft format : pc graphics : 9 sound : 8 game play : 10 enduring appeal : 10 overall : 9.5 designing that character is very simple and you do not need to worry about statistic points for strength , dexterity , etc .
instead you simply choose which side of the moral divide you wish to be on - the alliance or the horde - and then one of the four available races in each side .
plus there are a host of different professions as well -lrb- warrior , shaman , hunter , etc -rrb- , each with different attributes .
once you are in , the world around you is impressive .
the graphics are not what you would call realistic , but the quality and consistency of the artwork around you , as well as the attention to detail , renders that immaterial .
there are a whole range of different types of countryside , from icy mountains to barren deserts , thick rainforests to grassy savannahs .
each has its own consistent palette and each is sumptuous to look at .
graphics are impressive for a mmorpg an issue common to mmorpgs is scope .
when you are confronted by an entire virtual world , with few limitations on where and what you can go and do , it is difficult to know where to begin .
world or warcraft does a very good job of giving your time in azeroth some structure , without making the experience linear .
available quests are clearly marked , and these quests do a very good job of guiding you to suitable areas of content , which expand and develop along with your character .
as a result you do not feel out of your depth , unless you intentionally wander off into high level areas both solo and group quests play a big part of world of warcraft , and whilst the different servers are dedicated to different types of action -lrb- pve : player vs environment - and pvp : player vs player -rrb- the majority of battles take place against computer-controlled monsters .
the player vs player elements are effectively restricted to alliance vs horde encounters , but it is possible to fight anybody in a duel , although there are no ill effects sustained from losing such a bout .
combat forms a core part of the game play overall world of warcraft is very difficult to sum up in such a short space .
it is a joy to behold , and a joy to play .
the usual monotony of " grinding " experience points in order to level up is very rarely to be seen as new areas and challenges are being uncovered all the time .
and with the exception of specific high-level dungeons , or cross-continent travel , there are no loading times to speak of .
if you are a casual gamer in need of a new challenge , or an experienced mmorpg-er wanting another world to sink your teeth into , world of warcraft could very well be exactly what you 're looking for .
it is the best mmorpg to date , and could well be for some time .
read a selection of your views on the game .
if your idea of fun , is clicking the same button all day to defeat a predictable computer controlled opponent , then this game is for you .
if you like that kind of thing but do n't want to pay a subscription then try neverwinter nights .
if you want actual team competition then you are better off trying shadowbane , quake or counter strike .
nick , london , uk i 'm starting to crack up here !
whilst i played -lrb- and loved the beta -rrb- i 'm rapidly loosing patience with the official release .
i 've been trying to register for over four hours now .
this is so far from professional it 's beyond a joke .
a fact that is only compounded after the problems encountered back when the game was launched in the us .
surely blizzard should have learned ?
chris , belfast i 've been hooked up to that game since late december and i must say it is really amazing .
as a somewhat hardcore online rpg player who grew up on muds , i found myself " at home " with wow .
my wife got sucked into the wow 's world as well , and she enjoys playing it as much as i do .
vaza , uldum realm almost everyone who purchased this game today has been left with an unusable product thanks to the account creation servers being taken down .
the servers were not able to handle the amount of incoming traffic .
this happened when the game was released in america , and blizzard should have been prepared for it happening here too .
alasdair mackenzie , cumbernauld , scotland i was on the beta of this and loved every minute .
i received my pre order today and guess what ?
the servers are down and i ca n't create and account .
the lucky few who managed to create an account this morning are also having problems with lag ! adam graham , sunderland unfortunately , it is certain at this point that blizzard has learned little from it 's american experience .
as we speak , world of warcraft account creation pages are down ; they went down even before peak hours on the first day of release .
further , there are queues to enter all servers , meaning that even if you manage to give blizzard your credit card details , you have to wait to play the game you purchased .
at this point it is a given that the game will be a hit , but blizzard will need to make massive changes to maintain it 's reputation .
alex , cambridge before world of warcraft i had naver played any other mmorpgs mostly due to the pricy monthly subscription fees , but after taking a chance with world of warcraft i would say that the monthly fee is well worth it .
i first got the game for christmas and being a sixteen year old i must say that it has beed severely detrimental to my social life .
zach , chicago , illinois , usa since around 2pm nobody who purchased the game can actually register to play ! !
john smoth , east midlands happy to see europe is now getting their turn with this game .
world of warcraft will keep you hooked hard , however , so i would n't recommend picking it up if you 're on a tight schedule . ; -rrb- garrett walters , colorado , usa the account creating servers have been down nearly all day and it is impossible to start the game without creating one .
blizzard knew how many people were wanting to play this game but they were too cheap to set up a system to cope with the influx of players .
robert sutton , halifax , england i played the beta , which closed on monday evening and have been like a big kid waiting for christmas ever since .
got the retail game today and ca n't wait to finish work .
this game is the best and sets a new high for other developers to aim for .
paul slade , bournemouth , england a friend of mine got world of warcraft in the post this morning , he disapeared into his room and i have n't seen him since ! !
but the person i really do feel sorry for is his girlfriend .
who scheduled the release of this wretched game three days before valentines day ?
becky , london what i 've seen has been a massive improvement on other mmorpg 's including npc traders that give a sample price for trading so prices dont go crazy in the player economy .
mine will be arriving tomorrow and i 'm definitely playing an orc .
neil shaw , doncaster , uk this game is addictive .
seriously .
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair .
you 'll love this game so much that you will hate what it does with your spare time .
just a warning to those with a strict time schedule who are interested in this game : keep track of time .
travis anderson , mcallen , texas it 's not for serious mmorpgers in my opinion - i 've simply bought the game for when everquest 2 is offline .
everquest 2 is by far a more complete package .
mike bowling , leeds this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it .
charles macintyre , england i love world of warcraft .
i 'm a long time fan of everquest and later planetside but neither compare to the playability and sheer joy of this game .
all races and classes can be played solo and grinding is at a minimum .
as a 50-something clergyman i have to keep my new passion somewhat of a secret at work but in my time off i am openly a gnome magician ! -lrb- lvl 35 -rrb- who could ask for more .
david boyer , boston massachusetts , usa i was really excited about world of warcraft until i learnt that it would be subscription based .
blizzard and the other mmorpg game manufacturers need to seriously look at their pricing if they ever want to truly go mass market .
where is the pay as you go pricing model ? david , london , england i was really impressed with the look , detail and the little things like when you walk through a thick forest it is actually a thick forest , not just a handful of tress visible at any one time .
the game was straight forward without the abiguity i 've seen in others and when you went to do something in did n't turn into final fantasy -lrb- which is a good thing unless you 're an account and love stats -rrb- .
i wo n't play this but if more of this type comes out i might get tempted away from counter-strike for minutes at a time .
richard , brighton normally i stick to first person shooters , but i must say after participating in the european beta , world of warcraft definitely hooked me enough to buy it .
the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .

most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .
it 's an absolutely fantastic game , and is about the only mmorpg which has managed to hold my interest for more than a week or two .
i think it works so well simply becasue the world it 's based on has almost evolved instead of being written in a week or so .
warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .
as a seasoned gamer i can honestly say i have n't found anything that i would change .
it is amazing .
well done blizzard you 've got another hit on your hands ! !
vanella mead , southampton uk i have been playing in the closed european beta and i expect my copy to arrive this morning .
world of warcraft is a extremely fun game to play .

in late 2004 when world of warcraft was released in north america it broke a number of records for the genre - including first day sales and concurrent users .
now it is europe 's turn to experience azeroth on developer blizzard 's new set of region-dedicated servers .
the first thing that strikes you about world of warcraft is just how easy it is to pick up and play .
most games of this type tend to require a great deal of attention and dedication to play , but in this case it is possible to enjoy the game in relatively short bursts - perfect for the more casual gamer .
read a selection of your views on world of warcraft you play the game through your on-screen character - or avatar - and as usual your overriding task in the game is to " level up " - in other words improve your character by gaining experience .
world of warcraft format : pc graphics : 9 sound : 8 game play : 10 enduring appeal : 10 overall : 9.5 designing that character is very simple and you do not need to worry about statistic points for strength , dexterity , etc .
instead you simply choose which side of the moral divide you wish to be on - the alliance or the horde - and then one of the four available races in each side .
plus there are a host of different professions as well -lrb- warrior , shaman , hunter , etc -rrb- , each with different attributes .
once you are in , the world around you is impressive .
the graphics are not what you would call realistic , but the quality and consistency of the artwork around you , as well as the attention to detail , renders that immaterial .
there are a whole range of different types of countryside , from icy mountains to barren deserts , thick rainforests to grassy savannahs .
each has its own consistent palette and each is sumptuous to look at .
graphics are impressive for a mmorpg an issue common to mmorpgs is scope .
when you are confronted by an entire virtual world , with few limitations on where and what you can go and do , it is difficult to know where to begin .
world or warcraft does a very good job of giving your time in azeroth some structure , without making the experience linear .
available quests are clearly marked , and these quests do a very good job of guiding you to suitable areas of content , which expand and develop along with your character .
as a result you do not feel out of your depth , unless you intentionally wander off into high level areas both solo and group quests play a big part of world of warcraft , and whilst the different servers are dedicated to different types of action -lrb- pve : player vs environment - and pvp : player vs player -rrb- the majority of battles take place against computer-controlled monsters .
the player vs player elements are effectively restricted to alliance vs horde encounters , but it is possible to fight anybody in a duel , although there are no ill effects sustained from losing such a bout .
combat forms a core part of the game play overall world of warcraft is very difficult to sum up in such a short space .
it is a joy to behold , and a joy to play .
the usual monotony of " grinding " experience points in order to level up is very rarely to be seen as new areas and challenges are being uncovered all the time .
and with the exception of specific high-level dungeons , or cross-continent travel , there are no loading times to speak of .
if you are a casual gamer in need of a new challenge , or an experienced mmorpg-er wanting another world to sink your teeth into , world of warcraft could very well be exactly what you 're looking for .
it is the best mmorpg to date , and could well be for some time .
read a selection of your views on the game .
if your idea of fun , is clicking the same button all day to defeat a predictable computer controlled opponent , then this game is for you .
if you like that kind of thing but do n't want to pay a subscription then try neverwinter nights .
if you want actual team competition then you are better off trying shadowbane , quake or counter strike .
nick , london , uk i 'm starting to crack up here !
whilst i played -lrb- and loved the beta -rrb- i 'm rapidly loosing patience with the official release .
i 've been trying to register for over four hours now .
this is so far from professional it 's beyond a joke .
a fact that is only compounded after the problems encountered back when the game was launched in the us .
surely blizzard should have learned ?
chris , belfast i 've been hooked up to that game since late december and i must say it is really amazing .
as a somewhat hardcore online rpg player who grew up on muds , i found myself " at home " with wow .
my wife got sucked into the wow 's world as well , and she enjoys playing it as much as i do .
vaza , uldum realm almost everyone who purchased this game today has been left with an unusable product thanks to the account creation servers being taken down .
the servers were not able to handle the amount of incoming traffic .
this happened when the game was released in america , and blizzard should have been prepared for it happening here too .
alasdair mackenzie , cumbernauld , scotland i was on the beta of this and loved every minute .
i received my pre order today and guess what ?
the servers are down and i ca n't create and account .
the lucky few who managed to create an account this morning are also having problems with lag ! adam graham , sunderland unfortunately , it is certain at this point that blizzard has learned little from it 's american experience .
as we speak , world of warcraft account creation pages are down ; they went down even before peak hours on the first day of release .
further , there are queues to enter all servers , meaning that even if you manage to give blizzard your credit card details , you have to wait to play the game you purchased .
at this point it is a given that the game will be a hit , but blizzard will need to make massive changes to maintain it 's reputation .
alex , cambridge before world of warcraft i had naver played any other mmorpgs mostly due to the pricy monthly subscription fees , but after taking a chance with world of warcraft i would say that the monthly fee is well worth it .
i first got the game for christmas and being a sixteen year old i must say that it has beed severely detrimental to my social life .
zach , chicago , illinois , usa since around 2pm nobody who purchased the game can actually register to play ! !
john smoth , east midlands happy to see europe is now getting their turn with this game .
world of warcraft will keep you hooked hard , however , so i would n't recommend picking it up if you 're on a tight schedule . ; -rrb- garrett walters , colorado , usa the account creating servers have been down nearly all day and it is impossible to start the game without creating one .
blizzard knew how many people were wanting to play this game but they were too cheap to set up a system to cope with the influx of players .
robert sutton , halifax , england i played the beta , which closed on monday evening and have been like a big kid waiting for christmas ever since .
got the retail game today and ca n't wait to finish work .
this game is the best and sets a new high for other developers to aim for .
paul slade , bournemouth , england a friend of mine got world of warcraft in the post this morning , he disapeared into his room and i have n't seen him since ! !
but the person i really do feel sorry for is his girlfriend .
who scheduled the release of this wretched game three days before valentines day ?
becky , london what i 've seen has been a massive improvement on other mmorpg 's including npc traders that give a sample price for trading so prices dont go crazy in the player economy .
mine will be arriving tomorrow and i 'm definitely playing an orc .
neil shaw , doncaster , uk this game is addictive .
seriously .
an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair .
you 'll love this game so much that you will hate what it does with your spare time .
just a warning to those with a strict time schedule who are interested in this game : keep track of time .
travis anderson , mcallen , texas it 's not for serious mmorpgers in my opinion - i 've simply bought the game for when everquest 2 is offline .
everquest 2 is by far a more complete package .
mike bowling , leeds this game is so good i 'm not going to get it , there 's no way i could limit the hours i 'd spend playing it .
charles macintyre , england i love world of warcraft .
i 'm a long time fan of everquest and later planetside but neither compare to the playability and sheer joy of this game .
all races and classes can be played solo and grinding is at a minimum .
as a 50-something clergyman i have to keep my new passion somewhat of a secret at work but in my time off i am openly a gnome magician ! -lrb- lvl 35 -rrb- who could ask for more .
david boyer , boston massachusetts , usa i was really excited about world of warcraft until i learnt that it would be subscription based .
blizzard and the other mmorpg game manufacturers need to seriously look at their pricing if they ever want to truly go mass market .
where is the pay as you go pricing model ? david , london , england i was really impressed with the look , detail and the little things like when you walk through a thick forest it is actually a thick forest , not just a handful of tress visible at any one time .
the game was straight forward without the abiguity i 've seen in others and when you went to do something in did n't turn into final fantasy -lrb- which is a good thing unless you 're an account and love stats -rrb- .
i wo n't play this but if more of this type comes out i might get tempted away from counter-strike for minutes at a time .
richard , brighton normally i stick to first person shooters , but i must say after participating in the european beta , world of warcraft definitely hooked me enough to buy it .
the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .

the in game community is great too .
everything about the game is brilliantly made .
go buy it now !
paul yendley , ryde , isle of wight i 've tried world of warcraft and while it is very good i do n't find it as ' fun ' to play as city of heroes .
while mmorpgs like warcraft require substantial amounts of time to dedicate to play , city of heroes can be played more like a singleplayer game at your convenience .
neil , crawley , england i found warcraft cartoony , overly simplistic and , to be honest , boring .
i 'm not a " power gamer " by any stretch of the imagination , nor am i someone who spends hours playing games every day .
but warcraft has little to challenge or interest me .
most mmorpgs you get out what you put in , but it does n't exactly let you put in the kind of work that other mmorpgs do .
i honestly ca n't see what the attraction of it is .
andy , surrey , england it beats all the other mmorpgs hands down on most fronts from good moderation to an easy learning curve and it lacks the usual elitist geek nerds who tend to be the death of other mmorpgs .
ion , bradford my husband and i played the us open beta version of world of warcraft and only had one account - nearly ended in divorce !
we have been playing the european beta with an account each and harmony has been restored to a point that we party our characters and fight together !
our games arrived last night and we logged on this morning and boy was it hard to go to work and leave it !
lynn , bangor , northern ireland world of warcraft has managed to consume my life .
it 's an absolutely fantastic game , and is about the only mmorpg which has managed to hold my interest for more than a week or two .
i think it works so well simply becasue the world it 's based on has almost evolved instead of being written in a week or so .
warcraft 's been around for over 10 years now , and the fact that the previous games shape the current world makes it interesting . , as a hardcore fps player , i was wary of warcraft and whether i 'd actually enjoy it .
in the space of the five days between starting to play and the end of the beta , i was completely and utterly hooked .
the game is so wonderfully easy to play , remarkably simple to get into and constantly challenging .
furthermore , whilst writing this my copy of the game dropped through my door !
james walsh , oxfordshire , uk i 've played this game non-stop since i was lucky enough to get onto the beta .
this is one of the best games to date and has taken over from halo as my fave of all time .
serious alcoholics beware - this game will keep you out of the pub for long periods of time .
chris mckenna , hull i have been playing on the north american servers since its release here in november .
blizzard , as usual , has done a superb job .
the player control and interface is easy to learn and use .
the graphics are phenomenal and there is enough variety to keep you interested for a long time .
definitely a game at the top of its field .
dave , toronto , canada my friends and i have been waiting for this game for nearly four years .
we have all been playing together in the beta test and consider the wait well worth it .
we all use headsets to allow us to talk to each other whilst playing - so the game enables us to socialise in a way that we would not be able to normally do due to the geographical separation that we have in the real world .
i would add a note of caution this game is very addictive so take time to ensure that your real world commitments do not lose out !
jon , london played the final stage of the open uk beta .
a fantastic game all round .
seems to have so much more depth than previous mmorpgs i have played .
fantastic cinamatics and thought provoking scenery .
if you are a fantasy freak and wanto to get away from the everyday grind of life in the rat race , then go get yourself a copy of wow .
you wo n't be disapointed !
alex ball , tunbridge wells , kent i was offered the opportunity of playing in the open beta , and to be honest i very nearly turned it down .
the reason for this apathy was the boredom and frustration i had suffered in the previous mmorpgs i had tried -lrb- ultima online and everquest -rrb- .
but , always up for trying something new , i gave it a go .
this game is a revelation , a revolution as far as mmorpgs go .
this was just non stop enjoyment every step of the way .
i thought i was a jaded hardened gamer who could not be impressed by new games anymore , how wrong was i ?
tim , dudley i 've been playing for a few months and the game is tremendous , nothing better than coming home from a hard day at the office to settle down and kill a few orcs with your mates !
new players to an mmorpg will not find an easier game to pick up and play ... just watch out for the amount of time you will spend playing it !
russ , swansea , wales i have played many mmorpgs in my time and warcraft is by far the best .
i was in european beta and i was instantly hooked .
i pre-ordered the collector 's edition , with various extras and got up at 4am to sign up and get a play in before going to work .
world of warcraft is fantastic well worth a go even if you have never played an online game before .
as a seasoned gamer i can honestly say i have n't found anything that i would change .
it is amazing .
well done blizzard you 've got another hit on your hands ! !
vanella mead , southampton uk i have been playing in the closed european beta and i expect my copy to arrive this morning .
world of warcraft is a extremely fun game to play .

rabbits , deer , dogs , tigers ... always at it , if you believe the innuendos .
humans , on the other hand , are considered more gentle and refined , due to their increased intelligence and heightened emotions .
in fact , when it comes to the key qualities of attraction , humans and animals share more than one might think .
sight for species with good eyesight , visual displays seem to play a very important role in triggering sexual attraction and hence all forms of visual adornment are used to help attract members of the opposite sex .
it appears that human males are particularly influenced by visual cues from females and of the two sexes tend to fall in love the quickest .
esoteric and surprising visual cues can sometimes be important for some species .
whereas the story goes for humans that gentlemen prefer blondes , lionesses , for example , prefer their males to be deep brunettes .
this is because it is correlated with higher testosterone levels and potentially better genes .
for humans and many other primates , faces are the single most important feature for attraction and when we meet individuals a large amount of our visual attention is focused on their face particularly the eyes and mouth .
scent considerable attention has focused on the more primitive vomeronasal system in the brain , since this bypasses all the brain 's thinking processes and directs its information exclusively towards the regions that control sex and aggression and hormonal regulation .
male hamsters , for example , have an absolute requirement for this system to be functioning in order to be attracted to and mate with a female hamster .
male mice also need it to be able to distinguish between males and females and female pigs require it to be turned on by boars .
but in humans , the receptor genes are no longer functioning , so smell does not have the same significance .
we can also detect odours using the main olfactory system which is more complex and gives rise to our conscious experience of smells .
however , while this is an emotive sense it does not have the same potential for " love at first " smell that the vomeronasal system has .
taste while we do n't generally go around tasting each other prior to deciding whether there is sexual attraction or not , there is a lot of taste as well as tactile stimulation going on when we kiss one another , particularly on the lips .
with other animal species there is often much more oral contact between individuals either during social investigation or grooming behaviours .
like smell it is unlikely for humans that this is the single cue that drives attraction but such oral investigation behaviours must have evolved for a reason .
kissing is a particularly efficient way for two individuals to be able to sample the chemistry of each other 's body , and can give information on health and hormonal status .
touch touch is certainly a very good sense for communicating romantic intentions to others and we together with many other species use it quite extensively and often with great subtlety .
the feel of another individual 's skin can also tell you a large amount about their health and even hormonal status and memories of caresses received can be extremely poignant .
however , once again for most of us this information is unlikely to be the key trigger for attraction .
sound certainly we and many other species find voices attractive and in humans deep , husky ones are considered sexually attractive by both sexes and these correlate with high testosterone levels and therefore potential high sex drive and good genes .
with many bird species a large component of courtship revolves around the complexity of an individual 's song but humans are more likely to be the recipient of a professional singer 's cd recording , rather than a personal serenade .
true romance established purely by long-distance phone is also something of a rarity and , rather like internet romance , can fall apart when the most important sense finally comes into play - sight .
love yourself as with your appearance , you are more likely to be attracted to someone who has a similar personality to yourself , but this is unlikely to stimulate your first feelings of attraction .
however , this is something that females are likely to take more account of than males since females need to be more choosey in picking a mate than their male counterparts do .
we and other animals also seem particularly attracted to others who resemble our parents .
love at first fright sharing good experiences together might seem a reasonable candidate for success , but research shows it is fear and terror which are more likely to result in mutual attraction .
this is probably because the resultant release of stress hormones activates the brain 's neurochemical systems that promote attachment bonds .
this was first shown in a classic study by dutton and aron in 1974 .
an attractive woman interviewed young men on a swaying rope bridge , 200 ft above a river , and also on terra firma .
mid-way through the interview , she gives them her phone number .
over 60 % from the rope bridge called her back , versus 30 % from terra firma .
staring deeply into one another 's eyes for several minutes also makes us attracted to one another so perhaps the secret of success on a first date is to ride a roller coaster while looking into each other 's eyes !
and if all else fails ?
if you have not got the key attraction attributes , then hang out with a member of your sex who does have and you may benefit from confusion , frustration or even his or her generosity .
this is a strategy that can be seen in many species which live in social groups although it might not represent a good basis for a long-term relationship .
professor keith kendrick will expand on the theories in this article in a valentine 's day lecture at gresham college , london , on monday at lunch time .

rabbits , deer , dogs , tigers ... always at it , if you believe the innuendos .
humans , on the other hand , are considered more gentle and refined , due to their increased intelligence and heightened emotions .
in fact , when it comes to the key qualities of attraction , humans and animals share more than one might think .
sight for species with good eyesight , visual displays seem to play a very important role in triggering sexual attraction and hence all forms of visual adornment are used to help attract members of the opposite sex .
visual cues : make-up helps attract the men it appears that human males are particularly influenced by visual cues from females and of the two sexes tend to fall in love the quickest .
esoteric and surprising visual cues can sometimes be important for some species .
whereas the story goes for humans that gentlemen prefer blondes , lionesses , for example , prefer their males to be deep brunettes .
this is because it is correlated with higher testosterone levels and potentially better genes .
for humans and many other primates , faces are the single most important feature for attraction and when we meet individuals a large amount of our visual attention is focused on their face particularly the eyes and mouth .
scent considerable attention has focused on the more primitive vomeronasal system in the brain , since this bypasses all the brain 's thinking processes and directs its information exclusively towards the regions that control sex and aggression and hormonal regulation .
male hamsters , for example , have an absolute requirement for this system to be functioning in order to be attracted to and mate with a female hamster .
smell is more crucial to animals than humans male mice also need it to be able to distinguish between males and females and female pigs require it to be turned on by boars .
but in humans , the receptor genes are no longer functioning , so smell does not have the same significance .
we can also detect odours using the main olfactory system which is more complex and gives rise to our conscious experience of smells .
however , while this is an emotive sense it does not have the same potential for " love at first " smell that the vomeronasal system has .
taste while we do n't generally go around tasting each other prior to deciding whether there is sexual attraction or not , there is a lot of taste as well as tactile stimulation going on when we kiss one another , particularly on the lips .
with other animal species there is often much more oral contact between individuals either during social investigation or grooming behaviours .
like smell it is unlikely for humans that this is the single cue that drives attraction but such oral investigation behaviours must have evolved for a reason .
kissing is a particularly efficient way for two individuals to be able to sample the chemistry of each other 's body , and can give information on health and hormonal status .
touch touch is certainly a very good sense for communicating romantic intentions to others and we together with many other species use it quite extensively and often with great subtlety .
the feel of another individual 's skin can also tell you a large amount about their health and even hormonal status and memories of caresses received can be extremely poignant .
however , once again for most of us this information is unlikely to be the key trigger for attraction .
sound certainly we and many other species find voices attractive and in humans deep , husky ones are considered sexually attractive by both sexes and these correlate with high testosterone levels and therefore potential high sex drive and good genes .
with many bird species a large component of courtship revolves around the complexity of an individual 's song but humans are more likely to be the recipient of a professional singer 's cd recording , rather than a personal serenade .
true romance established purely by long-distance phone is also something of a rarity and , rather like internet romance , can fall apart when the most important sense finally comes into play - sight .
love yourself as with your appearance , you are more likely to be attracted to someone who has a similar personality to yourself , but this is unlikely to stimulate your first feelings of attraction .
however , this is something that females are likely to take more account of than males since females need to be more choosey in picking a mate than their male counterparts do .
we and other animals also seem particularly attracted to others who resemble our parents .
love at first fright sharing good experiences together might seem a reasonable candidate for success , but research shows it is fear and terror which are more likely to result in mutual attraction .
this is probably because the resultant release of stress hormones activates the brain 's neurochemical systems that promote attachment bonds .
a deep look into the eyes helps .
this was first shown in a classic study by dutton and aron in 1974 .
an attractive woman interviewed young men on a swaying rope bridge , 200 ft above a river , and also on terra firma .
mid-way through the interview , she gives them her phone number .
over 60 % from the rope bridge called her back , versus 30 % from terra firma .
staring deeply into one another 's eyes for several minutes also makes us attracted to one another so perhaps the secret of success on a first date is to ride a roller coaster while looking into each other 's eyes !
and if all else fails ?
if you have not got the key attraction attributes , then hang out with a member of your sex who does have and you may benefit from confusion , frustration or even his or her generosity .
this is a strategy that can be seen in many species which live in social groups although it might not represent a good basis for a long-term relationship .
professor keith kendrick will expand on the theories in this article in a valentine 's day lecture at gresham college , london , on monday at lunch time .

models wore a variety of furs , some fox pelts still had feet and tails on , in a collection " inspired by miss marple " .
his work has been criticised by campaign group - people for the ethical treatment of animals -lrb- peta -rrb- .
the merthyr-born designer said his work was aimed for the russian market and its sub-zero temperatures .
but peta argued that there are many modern fabrics are more effective at keeping people warm .
in a statement the campaign group said : " fur is a relic of prehistoric times , when it was the only thing to keep primitive people from freezing .
" today 's lightweight synthetics , such as gore-tex , are much more efficient at keeping people warm .
faux fur or no fur is more in tune with current concerns about the mistreatment of animals . "
furs were only part of macdonald 's latest collection .
the designer said he was inspired by a practical-minded miss marple - agatha christie 's fictional detective - and the flamboyance of florence .
" it 's about miss marple going to florence , but obviously it 's a new day miss marple , " said macdonald .
" so you know i 've taken the idea of the flat shoes and made them high .
elizabeth jagger , draped with a fox fur pelt , poses backstage " i 've taken her little sweater and i 've made it very glamorous and very sparkly .
she goes to florence and in florence , italian women are very glamourous and dripped in fur with lots of colours .
" so this is kind of the loose inspiration behind the collection , " he said .
a celebrity audience was at the autumn / winter show on sunday , to see naomi campbell , mick jagger 's daughter elizabeth and jerry hall show off the collection .
macdonald , dubbed the king of cobwebs because of his intricate designs , was the first designer of 47 who will show off their work this week .
it is not the first time macdonald 's designs have attracted controversy .
peta campaigners were ejected from macdonald 's 2003 london fashion week show after storming the catwalk to protest at his use of rabbit fur .

mr temaru 's union for democracy looks set to win 25 of 37 seats voted for on sunday , while the conservative party of president gaston flosse won 10 seats .
this means that both parties now hold 27 seats each in the national assembly .
the election was called to end a political crisis after a poll victory by mr temaru was annulled last year .
france 's highest administrative court , the state counsel , had called for new elections on two of the french polynesia 's main islands , including tahiti , citing voting irregularities in some polling stations .
provisional results of these indicate both parties will hold the same number of seats , and nicole bouteau 's alliance for a new democracy will hold the remaining three .
it is not clear who will now hold the balance of power .
mr temaru became the country 's first pro-independence leader when he was elected last may , but his grip on power did not last long .
he was defeated in a vote of no-confidence and the top job went back to his old rival , mr flosse , who has dominated politics in the archipelago for two decades .
he is a long-standing ally of french president jacques chirac , and the pro-independence movement said paris had conspired illegally to reinstate mr flosse , allegations that french authorities have strongly denied .
