what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .
yet many men like michael still did n't protect themselves by using condoms . " in some ways men are all the same , and when it comes to sex they are all equally stupid , " he said .
" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
almost 60 percent of new infections were among homosexual men .
some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat . " there are these images in the heads of young gay men that hiv carriers are 35 and older , wearing leather jackets and a beard , and that you do n't need to worry about anyone who does n't fit this cliché , " knoll said .
" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal . " like michael , thomas , who also did not want his last name published , grew up hearing about the dangers of hiv in the media , but unlike older gay men , he never met anyone who was positive - let alone ill with aids - and felt it was something that happened to other people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ignorance kills " you know it ’ s there , and you do think of it , but you don ’ t talk about it openly , " he said .
" you meet your friends for a drink after work , and then maybe , you go for dinner .
but this topic is not discussed over dinner - no one wants to talk about it . " ' i think about death every day ' thomas said he and his partner were faithful and practiced safe sex at first , but stopped after they fell in love .
he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .
" and now i ask myself every day how life is going to continue .
i even wonder what my death is going to be like .
i think about death every day . " love , lust and alcohol are the most dangerous obstacles to protection against hiv , according to dr. werner becker , who heads one of germany 's largest gay practices .
he tries to strengthen his patients for situations when they are tempted not to use protection . " some worry that a condom may signal that they are worried about the other man being infected or even signal that they themselves are infected , " he said .
" the symbolism of the condom in sexual communication is strong and varied . " many no longer afraid of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are afraid of having unsafe sex knoll , of munich 's aids-hilfe , said he does n't know how to convince a generation of increasingly careless gay men back to responsible , self-protective behavior . " there are many out there who say , we just have to inflict fear in people again , " he said .
" but in the 1980s no one inflicted fear , they simply were afraid .
today they no longer are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.12.2005 cia affair threatens transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure to find out about secret cia flights in europe is growing reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to . at first it was a muted response .
friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards .

germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons .

both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 less fear of hiv is pushing up infection rates among gay men großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been over 1,000 new hiv infections in germany in 2005 how aids is spread is no longer a mystery to most of the west , but in 2005 the number of infections in germany rose by 20 percent - even more in the gay community .
what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .
yet many men like michael still did n't protect themselves by using condoms . " in some ways men are all the same , and when it comes to sex they are all equally stupid , " he said .
" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
almost 60 percent of new infections were among homosexual men .
some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat . " there are these images in the heads of young gay men that hiv carriers are 35 and older , wearing leather jackets and a beard , and that you do n't need to worry about anyone who does n't fit this cliché , " knoll said .
" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal . " like michael , thomas , who also did not want his last name published , grew up hearing about the dangers of hiv in the media , but unlike older gay men , he never met anyone who was positive - let alone ill with aids - and felt it was something that happened to other people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ignorance kills " you know it ’ s there , and you do think of it , but you don ’ t talk about it openly , " he said .
" you meet your friends for a drink after work , and then maybe , you go for dinner .
but this topic is not discussed over dinner - no one wants to talk about it . " ' i think about death every day ' thomas said he and his partner were faithful and practiced safe sex at first , but stopped after they fell in love .
he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .
" and now i ask myself every day how life is going to continue .
i even wonder what my death is going to be like .
i think about death every day . " love , lust and alcohol are the most dangerous obstacles to protection against hiv , according to dr. werner becker , who heads one of germany 's largest gay practices .
he tries to strengthen his patients for situations when they are tempted not to use protection . " some worry that a condom may signal that they are worried about the other man being infected or even signal that they themselves are infected , " he said .
" the symbolism of the condom in sexual communication is strong and varied . " many no longer afraid of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are afraid of having unsafe sex knoll , of munich 's aids-hilfe , said he does n't know how to convince a generation of increasingly careless gay men back to responsible , self-protective behavior . " there are many out there who say , we just have to inflict fear in people again , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 01.12.2005 transatlantic ties and cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian airfield is allegedly a site for one of the cia prisons many readers have expressed concern over rumors of secret cia prisons in europe and consequences for eu-us ties .
with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 " bremen taliban " celebrates small legal victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz , taken before his capture in pakistan in 2001 murat kurnaz has been imprisoned on guantanamo bay since 2002 , charged as an enemy combatant despite evidence to the contrary .
this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.12.2005 europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's new strategy is also aimed at the seeds of terrorism eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition . building on momentum from the madrid train bombings in 2004 and the london public transport attacks on july 7 , the strategy outlines security goals and ways to make the eu 's aims more understandable to average europeans . but issues such as increasing police access to telephone and internet data and allowing them to shut down extremist web sites remain unresolved , amid concerns over privacy rights . " the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said . " there 's a long range of issues which continue to generate discussion " on the telecommunications data alone , he said on condition of anonymity . " they vary from retention periods , through the handling of costs , through access and how to regulate access to the information , to the question of how you do data retention and data security ... just to take a handful . " questions remain over data retention and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data retention and security is still a contentious issue the measures would oblige businesses to keep details about callers , such as who they spoke to , where and when , and would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages , and internet protocols . police would not have access to the conversation or message itself . london also wants information about unanswered communications kept - a controversial demand as it would force the industry into extra spending . britain hopes to fast-track a european-wide package of anti-terror measures through the european parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of member states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .
" i saw ceremonies for 30 years .
one was different - albertville 92 .
it was a shock that an artist and not a disney type was putting on the show , " heller said . brian eno , a former member of roxy music who has produced albums by u2 and david bowie , will compose a 2006 world cup anthem using instruments from across the world .
former genesis front man peter garbriel will act as musical director . a processio n of world cup wi n n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's world cup winner diego maradona will be at the event as well as music and dance , the gala will also feature a total of 132 former world cup winners , including argentina 's 1986 hero diego maradona -lrb- photo -rrb- and brazil 's three-time victor pele . " it is like having -lrb- diego -rrb- maradona , pele , -lrb- johan -rrb- cruyff and -lrb- alfredo -rrb- di stefano all playing for the same team , " said franz beckenbauer , head of the 2006 world cup organizing committee at the launch . glittering stars from the arts and sports will not be the only ones taking center stage .
approximately 13,000 potential volunteer performers and helpers applied in the first phase of auditions which closed on nov .

you gotta pay for it when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience . is it one more example of a once free , public good gone the way of privatization ?
is it a sign of the decay of western civilization ?
or at least of its toilet facilities ? two schools near the town of marburg were fed up with the appalling state of their toilets .
seats were often ripped off the bowls , graffiti was scrawled on the partitions , hygiene conditions were , well , less than ideal . so the schools decided to go on the offensive against toilet abusers .
they renovated several of the schools ' restrooms and then put them under guard - not armed , but under the strict watch of so-called klofraue n , women whose job it is to maintain order and cleanliness in public facilities .
they 're a frequent sight in many public toilets , but generally not at schools . however , students and school administrators had just had enough of the execrable state of their lavatories . " the facilities are often in such a condition , that it is just no fun to go to the toilet .
many kids just hold it in , " a speaker for the school district told hessian broadcasting . not anymore .
those students who want to spend their toilet time surrounded by gleaming surfaces and toilet paper dispensers that are always full can cough up the ten cents it now costs to use the new loos . but administrators at the school are not merciless .
those kids who might not have any spare change on them do n't have to grin and bear it , or wet their pants , there are a few non-renovated toilets that 'll still allow kids to pee for free . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's pink powder room problem an architectural project in the eastern city of magdeburg faces a few last minute hurdles before its grand opening : the administrator of estate of the building 's late creator has some problems with its design .

" the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said . " there 's a long range of issues which continue to generate discussion " on the telecommunications data alone , he said on condition of anonymity . " they vary from retention periods , through the handling of costs , through access and how to regulate access to the information , to the question of how you do data retention and data security ... just to take a handful . " questions remain over data retention and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data retention and security is still a contentious issue the measures would oblige businesses to keep details about callers , such as who they spoke to , where and when , and would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages , and internet protocols . police would not have access to the conversation or message itself . london also wants information about unanswered communications kept - a controversial demand as it would force the industry into extra spending . britain hopes to fast-track a european-wide package of anti-terror measures through the european parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of member states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

politicians and pundits , including bärbel höhn , head of the german parliamentary committee on consumer protection , welcomed the plan and urged quick implementation .
but höhn said even stronger actions are needed to prevent consumers from buying and eating spoiled meat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister horst seehofer made up the 10-point plan seehofer hammered out his agenda , which he made public wednesday , together with ministers from the german states .
in brief , the planned changes call for improved communication , the extension of a registry for lawbreakers to cover the entire european union , and more consistent punishments .
registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .
the ministry expects brussels to approve the creation of an eu-wide system to register firms that have sold spoiled meat as early as this month .
in january , seehofer will meet with state ministers to discuss increased sanctions for rule breakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel höhn : she likes the talk , but wants action in an interview with the berli n er zeitu n g daily , green party politician höhn said she welcomed the government 's plan , but at the same time stressed the need for action .

but words have to be followed by deeds , " she said .
she noted that such plans often get swept under the table once a scandal is off the headlines , adding , " if we do n't put it into effect , then the next scandal is bound to happen . "
she told the rhei n ische post newspaper that the plan to publicize the names of companies that sell spoiled meat is a " great step forward . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.12.2005 cia affair threatens transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure to find out about secret cia flights in europe is growing reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to . at first it was a muted response .
friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .
" most want to wait until they have a clear picture of what the consequences of cooperation are .
that should not include making an arrest and then turning over the suspect to be tortured .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .
" most want to wait until they have a clear picture of what the consequences of cooperation are .
that should not include making an arrest and then turning over the suspect to be tortured .

both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 less fear of hiv is pushing up infection rates among gay men großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been over 1,000 new hiv infections in germany in 2005 how aids is spread is no longer a mystery to most of the west , but in 2005 the number of infections in germany rose by 20 percent - even more in the gay community .
what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .
yet many men like michael still did n't protect themselves by using condoms . " in some ways men are all the same , and when it comes to sex they are all equally stupid , " he said .
" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
almost 60 percent of new infections were among homosexual men .
some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat . " there are these images in the heads of young gay men that hiv carriers are 35 and older , wearing leather jackets and a beard , and that you do n't need to worry about anyone who does n't fit this cliché , " knoll said .
" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal . " like michael , thomas , who also did not want his last name published , grew up hearing about the dangers of hiv in the media , but unlike older gay men , he never met anyone who was positive - let alone ill with aids - and felt it was something that happened to other people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ignorance kills " you know it ’ s there , and you do think of it , but you don ’ t talk about it openly , " he said .
" you meet your friends for a drink after work , and then maybe , you go for dinner .
but this topic is not discussed over dinner - no one wants to talk about it . " ' i think about death every day ' thomas said he and his partner were faithful and practiced safe sex at first , but stopped after they fell in love .
he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .

what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .
yet many men like michael still did n't protect themselves by using condoms . " in some ways men are all the same , and when it comes to sex they are all equally stupid , " he said .
" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
almost 60 percent of new infections were among homosexual men .
some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat . " there are these images in the heads of young gay men that hiv carriers are 35 and older , wearing leather jackets and a beard , and that you do n't need to worry about anyone who does n't fit this cliché , " knoll said .
" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal . " like michael , thomas , who also did not want his last name published , grew up hearing about the dangers of hiv in the media , but unlike older gay men , he never met anyone who was positive - let alone ill with aids - and felt it was something that happened to other people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ignorance kills " you know it ’ s there , and you do think of it , but you don ’ t talk about it openly , " he said .
" you meet your friends for a drink after work , and then maybe , you go for dinner .
but this topic is not discussed over dinner - no one wants to talk about it . " ' i think about death every day ' thomas said he and his partner were faithful and practiced safe sex at first , but stopped after they fell in love .
he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .
" and now i ask myself every day how life is going to continue .
i even wonder what my death is going to be like .
i think about death every day . " love , lust and alcohol are the most dangerous obstacles to protection against hiv , according to dr. werner becker , who heads one of germany 's largest gay practices .
he tries to strengthen his patients for situations when they are tempted not to use protection . " some worry that a condom may signal that they are worried about the other man being infected or even signal that they themselves are infected , " he said .
" the symbolism of the condom in sexual communication is strong and varied . " many no longer afraid of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are afraid of having unsafe sex knoll , of munich 's aids-hilfe , said he does n't know how to convince a generation of increasingly careless gay men back to responsible , self-protective behavior . " there are many out there who say , we just have to inflict fear in people again , " he said .
" but in the 1980s no one inflicted fear , they simply were afraid .
today they no longer are .

" we want to find out as quickly as possible where she is being kept , in order to free her from the grip of the terrorists , " he told germany 's neue os n abrücker zeitu n g .
his country would work with the german government on the matter " in every possible way , in order to free the hostage susanne ostoff , " he said . civilia n target osthoff and her iraqi driver were seized last friday , and were pictured in a videotape blindfolded with armed militants standing beside them .
the militants are reportedly demanding that germany cease its dealings with talabani 's government or they will kill the hostages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kidnapped german archeologist osthoff germany opposed the us-led invasion of iraq and has refused to send troops there , but has been training iraqi soldiers and police outside the country . speaking to the newspaper , talabani said the kidnapping shows the true face of terror .
germany did n't take part in the iraq war , and the hostage is not connected to the military . " susanne ostoff is a civilian , but the terrorists kidnapped her anyway , " he said .
" i deeply abhor this act of terror , and give my deepest sympathy and solidarity to the family and friends of those kidnapped . " meanwhile , new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he has not ruled out that the kidnapping is a criminal , rather than a political , act ; he points to the poor film quality , and the lack of a religious message on the tape . it ca n't be judged the work of criminals on that basis alone , steinmeier said .
but , he added , " i consider it a possible , if not certain , conclusion . " no co n tact with hostage so far , no contact has been made with osthoff through a middleman , and no real progress in the six-day-old case has been made .
he repeated his promise that the government would proceed with the case " with judgement and sensitivity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says kidnapping may be a criminal act osthoff had been working on the renovation of a historical house in iraq since may .
she was warned by authorities that her stay was not safe , a local official told the associated press . according to talabani , the extremists are not trying to " resist the coalition , " they are merely trying to destroy the democratization process , and ruin the chances for iraq to rebuild .
theirs are simply " criminal acts against innocent civilians and against peace in iraq , " he said . talaba n i : " we n eed support " iraq needs international support " to keep expanding our security forces , in order to prevent such horrific crimes in the future , and so that the nascent democracy in my country can be a success , " talabani added . wolfgang bosbach , a senior member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the incident shows that germany is not immune from terrorism . " it would be fatal to think , simply because we were not military involved in the iraq war , that we 're on the safe side , " bosbach told the netzeitu n g . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany not protected by anti-war stance the kidnapping of a german aid worker in iraq proves that germany 's stark opposition to the us-led war will not be enough to protect the country from terrorism , according to interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .
" i saw ceremonies for 30 years .
one was different - albertville 92 .
it was a shock that an artist and not a disney type was putting on the show , " heller said . brian eno , a former member of roxy music who has produced albums by u2 and david bowie , will compose a 2006 world cup anthem using instruments from across the world .

with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

" the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .
" i saw ceremonies for 30 years .
one was different - albertville 92 .
it was a shock that an artist and not a disney type was putting on the show , " heller said . brian eno , a former member of roxy music who has produced albums by u2 and david bowie , will compose a 2006 world cup anthem using instruments from across the world .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp .
-lrb- march 10 , 2004 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

" the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said . " there 's a long range of issues which continue to generate discussion " on the telecommunications data alone , he said on condition of anonymity . " they vary from retention periods , through the handling of costs , through access and how to regulate access to the information , to the question of how you do data retention and data security ... just to take a handful . " questions remain over data retention and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data retention and security is still a contentious issue the measures would oblige businesses to keep details about callers , such as who they spoke to , where and when , and would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages , and internet protocols . police would not have access to the conversation or message itself . london also wants information about unanswered communications kept - a controversial demand as it would force the industry into extra spending . britain hopes to fast-track a european-wide package of anti-terror measures through the european parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of member states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 " bremen taliban " celebrates small legal victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz , taken before his capture in pakistan in 2001 murat kurnaz has been imprisoned on guantanamo bay since 2002 , charged as an enemy combatant despite evidence to the contrary .
this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

" we want to find out as quickly as possible where she is being kept , in order to free her from the grip of the terrorists , " he told germany 's neue os n abrücker zeitu n g .
his country would work with the german government on the matter " in every possible way , in order to free the hostage susanne ostoff , " he said . civilia n target osthoff and her iraqi driver were seized last friday , and were pictured in a videotape blindfolded with armed militants standing beside them .
the militants are reportedly demanding that germany cease its dealings with talabani 's government or they will kill the hostages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kidnapped german archeologist osthoff germany opposed the us-led invasion of iraq and has refused to send troops there , but has been training iraqi soldiers and police outside the country . speaking to the newspaper , talabani said the kidnapping shows the true face of terror .
germany did n't take part in the iraq war , and the hostage is not connected to the military . " susanne ostoff is a civilian , but the terrorists kidnapped her anyway , " he said .
" i deeply abhor this act of terror , and give my deepest sympathy and solidarity to the family and friends of those kidnapped . " meanwhile , new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he has not ruled out that the kidnapping is a criminal , rather than a political , act ; he points to the poor film quality , and the lack of a religious message on the tape . it ca n't be judged the work of criminals on that basis alone , steinmeier said .
but , he added , " i consider it a possible , if not certain , conclusion . " no co n tact with hostage so far , no contact has been made with osthoff through a middleman , and no real progress in the six-day-old case has been made .
he repeated his promise that the government would proceed with the case " with judgement and sensitivity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says kidnapping may be a criminal act osthoff had been working on the renovation of a historical house in iraq since may .
she was warned by authorities that her stay was not safe , a local official told the associated press . according to talabani , the extremists are not trying to " resist the coalition , " they are merely trying to destroy the democratization process , and ruin the chances for iraq to rebuild .
theirs are simply " criminal acts against innocent civilians and against peace in iraq , " he said . talaba n i : " we n eed support " iraq needs international support " to keep expanding our security forces , in order to prevent such horrific crimes in the future , and so that the nascent democracy in my country can be a success , " talabani added . wolfgang bosbach , a senior member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the incident shows that germany is not immune from terrorism . " it would be fatal to think , simply because we were not military involved in the iraq war , that we 're on the safe side , " bosbach told the netzeitu n g . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany not protected by anti-war stance the kidnapping of a german aid worker in iraq proves that germany 's stark opposition to the us-led war will not be enough to protect the country from terrorism , according to interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 less fear of hiv is pushing up infection rates among gay men großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been over 1,000 new hiv infections in germany in 2005 how aids is spread is no longer a mystery to most of the west , but in 2005 the number of infections in germany rose by 20 percent - even more in the gay community .
what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .
yet many men like michael still did n't protect themselves by using condoms . " in some ways men are all the same , and when it comes to sex they are all equally stupid , " he said .
" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
almost 60 percent of new infections were among homosexual men .
some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat . " there are these images in the heads of young gay men that hiv carriers are 35 and older , wearing leather jackets and a beard , and that you do n't need to worry about anyone who does n't fit this cliché , " knoll said .
" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal . " like michael , thomas , who also did not want his last name published , grew up hearing about the dangers of hiv in the media , but unlike older gay men , he never met anyone who was positive - let alone ill with aids - and felt it was something that happened to other people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ignorance kills " you know it ’ s there , and you do think of it , but you don ’ t talk about it openly , " he said .
" you meet your friends for a drink after work , and then maybe , you go for dinner .
but this topic is not discussed over dinner - no one wants to talk about it . " ' i think about death every day ' thomas said he and his partner were faithful and practiced safe sex at first , but stopped after they fell in love .
he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .
" and now i ask myself every day how life is going to continue .
i even wonder what my death is going to be like .
i think about death every day . " love , lust and alcohol are the most dangerous obstacles to protection against hiv , according to dr. werner becker , who heads one of germany 's largest gay practices .
he tries to strengthen his patients for situations when they are tempted not to use protection . " some worry that a condom may signal that they are worried about the other man being infected or even signal that they themselves are infected , " he said .
" the symbolism of the condom in sexual communication is strong and varied . " many no longer afraid of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are afraid of having unsafe sex knoll , of munich 's aids-hilfe , said he does n't know how to convince a generation of increasingly careless gay men back to responsible , self-protective behavior . " there are many out there who say , we just have to inflict fear in people again , " he said .
" but in the 1980s no one inflicted fear , they simply were afraid .
today they no longer are .

what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .

" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .

" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal .

i even wonder what my death is going to be like .
i think about death every day . " love , lust and alcohol are the most dangerous obstacles to protection against hiv , according to dr. werner becker , who heads one of germany 's largest gay practices .
he tries to strengthen his patients for situations when they are tempted not to use protection . " some worry that a condom may signal that they are worried about the other man being infected or even signal that they themselves are infected , " he said .
" the symbolism of the condom in sexual communication is strong and varied . " many no longer afraid of infection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are afraid of having unsafe sex knoll , of munich 's aids-hilfe , said he does n't know how to convince a generation of increasingly careless gay men back to responsible , self-protective behavior .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .

" european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .
" most want to wait until they have a clear picture of what the consequences of cooperation are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 01.12.2005 transatlantic ties and cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian airfield is allegedly a site for one of the cia prisons many readers have expressed concern over rumors of secret cia prisons in europe and consequences for eu-us ties .
with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .

politicians and pundits , including bärbel höhn , head of the german parliamentary committee on consumer protection , welcomed the plan and urged quick implementation .
but höhn said even stronger actions are needed to prevent consumers from buying and eating spoiled meat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister horst seehofer made up the 10-point plan seehofer hammered out his agenda , which he made public wednesday , together with ministers from the german states .
in brief , the planned changes call for improved communication , the extension of a registry for lawbreakers to cover the entire european union , and more consistent punishments .
registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .
the ministry expects brussels to approve the creation of an eu-wide system to register firms that have sold spoiled meat as early as this month .
in january , seehofer will meet with state ministers to discuss increased sanctions for rule breakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel höhn : she likes the talk , but wants action in an interview with the berli n er zeitu n g daily , green party politician höhn said she welcomed the government 's plan , but at the same time stressed the need for action .
more i n spectors n eeded the agriculture minister 's plan is " ok .
but words have to be followed by deeds , " she said .
she noted that such plans often get swept under the table once a scandal is off the headlines , adding , " if we do n't put it into effect , then the next scandal is bound to happen . "
she told the rhei n ische post newspaper that the plan to publicize the names of companies that sell spoiled meat is a " great step forward . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 " bremen taliban " celebrates small legal victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz , taken before his capture in pakistan in 2001 murat kurnaz has been imprisoned on guantanamo bay since 2002 , charged as an enemy combatant despite evidence to the contrary .
this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 " bremen taliban " celebrates small legal victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz , taken before his capture in pakistan in 2001 murat kurnaz has been imprisoned on guantanamo bay since 2002 , charged as an enemy combatant despite evidence to the contrary .
this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .

" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 " bremen taliban " celebrates small legal victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz , taken before his capture in pakistan in 2001 murat kurnaz has been imprisoned on guantanamo bay since 2002 , charged as an enemy combatant despite evidence to the contrary .
this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- british guantanamo prisoners released , criticism remains five british prisoners held at the u.s. prison camp on guantanamo bay will arrive in the u.k. today .
their return wo n't heal the rift between europe and the u.s. on the controversial camp .
-lrb- march 10 , 2004 -rrb- ' bremen taliban ' or victim of circumstance ?
a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .
but german investigators say there 's no proof .

" the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said . " there 's a long range of issues which continue to generate discussion " on the telecommunications data alone , he said on condition of anonymity . " they vary from retention periods , through the handling of costs , through access and how to regulate access to the information , to the question of how you do data retention and data security ... just to take a handful . " questions remain over data retention and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data retention and security is still a contentious issue the measures would oblige businesses to keep details about callers , such as who they spoke to , where and when , and would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages , and internet protocols . police would not have access to the conversation or message itself . london also wants information about unanswered communications kept - a controversial demand as it would force the industry into extra spending . britain hopes to fast-track a european-wide package of anti-terror measures through the european parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of member states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .

although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards .

what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .

" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .

" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 01.12.2005 transatlantic ties and cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian airfield is allegedly a site for one of the cia prisons many readers have expressed concern over rumors of secret cia prisons in europe and consequences for eu-us ties .
with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .

with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2005 " bremen taliban " celebrates small legal victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz , taken before his capture in pakistan in 2001 murat kurnaz has been imprisoned on guantanamo bay since 2002 , charged as an enemy combatant despite evidence to the contrary .
this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

" we want to find out as quickly as possible where she is being kept , in order to free her from the grip of the terrorists , " he told germany 's neue os n abrücker zeitu n g .
his country would work with the german government on the matter " in every possible way , in order to free the hostage susanne ostoff , " he said . civilia n target osthoff and her iraqi driver were seized last friday , and were pictured in a videotape blindfolded with armed militants standing beside them .
the militants are reportedly demanding that germany cease its dealings with talabani 's government or they will kill the hostages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kidnapped german archeologist osthoff germany opposed the us-led invasion of iraq and has refused to send troops there , but has been training iraqi soldiers and police outside the country . speaking to the newspaper , talabani said the kidnapping shows the true face of terror .
germany did n't take part in the iraq war , and the hostage is not connected to the military . " susanne ostoff is a civilian , but the terrorists kidnapped her anyway , " he said .
" i deeply abhor this act of terror , and give my deepest sympathy and solidarity to the family and friends of those kidnapped . " meanwhile , new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he has not ruled out that the kidnapping is a criminal , rather than a political , act ; he points to the poor film quality , and the lack of a religious message on the tape . it ca n't be judged the work of criminals on that basis alone , steinmeier said .
but , he added , " i consider it a possible , if not certain , conclusion . " no co n tact with hostage so far , no contact has been made with osthoff through a middleman , and no real progress in the six-day-old case has been made .
he repeated his promise that the government would proceed with the case " with judgement and sensitivity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says kidnapping may be a criminal act osthoff had been working on the renovation of a historical house in iraq since may .
she was warned by authorities that her stay was not safe , a local official told the associated press . according to talabani , the extremists are not trying to " resist the coalition , " they are merely trying to destroy the democratization process , and ruin the chances for iraq to rebuild .
theirs are simply " criminal acts against innocent civilians and against peace in iraq , " he said . talaba n i : " we n eed support " iraq needs international support " to keep expanding our security forces , in order to prevent such horrific crimes in the future , and so that the nascent democracy in my country can be a success , " talabani added . wolfgang bosbach , a senior member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the incident shows that germany is not immune from terrorism . " it would be fatal to think , simply because we were not military involved in the iraq war , that we 're on the safe side , " bosbach told the netzeitu n g . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany not protected by anti-war stance the kidnapping of a german aid worker in iraq proves that germany 's stark opposition to the us-led war will not be enough to protect the country from terrorism , according to interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

" we want to find out as quickly as possible where she is being kept , in order to free her from the grip of the terrorists , " he told germany 's neue os n abrücker zeitu n g .
his country would work with the german government on the matter " in every possible way , in order to free the hostage susanne ostoff , " he said . civilia n target osthoff and her iraqi driver were seized last friday , and were pictured in a videotape blindfolded with armed militants standing beside them .
the militants are reportedly demanding that germany cease its dealings with talabani 's government or they will kill the hostages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kidnapped german archeologist osthoff germany opposed the us-led invasion of iraq and has refused to send troops there , but has been training iraqi soldiers and police outside the country . speaking to the newspaper , talabani said the kidnapping shows the true face of terror .
germany did n't take part in the iraq war , and the hostage is not connected to the military . " susanne ostoff is a civilian , but the terrorists kidnapped her anyway , " he said .
" i deeply abhor this act of terror , and give my deepest sympathy and solidarity to the family and friends of those kidnapped . " meanwhile , new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he has not ruled out that the kidnapping is a criminal , rather than a political , act ; he points to the poor film quality , and the lack of a religious message on the tape . it ca n't be judged the work of criminals on that basis alone , steinmeier said .
but , he added , " i consider it a possible , if not certain , conclusion . " no co n tact with hostage so far , no contact has been made with osthoff through a middleman , and no real progress in the six-day-old case has been made .
he repeated his promise that the government would proceed with the case " with judgement and sensitivity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says kidnapping may be a criminal act osthoff had been working on the renovation of a historical house in iraq since may .
she was warned by authorities that her stay was not safe , a local official told the associated press . according to talabani , the extremists are not trying to " resist the coalition , " they are merely trying to destroy the democratization process , and ruin the chances for iraq to rebuild .
theirs are simply " criminal acts against innocent civilians and against peace in iraq , " he said . talaba n i : " we n eed support " iraq needs international support " to keep expanding our security forces , in order to prevent such horrific crimes in the future , and so that the nascent democracy in my country can be a success , " talabani added . wolfgang bosbach , a senior member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the incident shows that germany is not immune from terrorism . " it would be fatal to think , simply because we were not military involved in the iraq war , that we 're on the safe side , " bosbach told the netzeitu n g . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany not protected by anti-war stance the kidnapping of a german aid worker in iraq proves that germany 's stark opposition to the us-led war will not be enough to protect the country from terrorism , according to interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

" the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said . " there 's a long range of issues which continue to generate discussion " on the telecommunications data alone , he said on condition of anonymity . " they vary from retention periods , through the handling of costs , through access and how to regulate access to the information , to the question of how you do data retention and data security ... just to take a handful . " questions remain over data retention and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data retention and security is still a contentious issue the measures would oblige businesses to keep details about callers , such as who they spoke to , where and when , and would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages , and internet protocols . police would not have access to the conversation or message itself . london also wants information about unanswered communications kept - a controversial demand as it would force the industry into extra spending . britain hopes to fast-track a european-wide package of anti-terror measures through the european parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of member states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 01.12.2005 transatlantic ties and cia affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a romanian airfield is allegedly a site for one of the cia prisons many readers have expressed concern over rumors of secret cia prisons in europe and consequences for eu-us ties .
with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?

you gotta pay for it when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience . is it one more example of a once free , public good gone the way of privatization ?
is it a sign of the decay of western civilization ?
or at least of its toilet facilities ? two schools near the town of marburg were fed up with the appalling state of their toilets .
seats were often ripped off the bowls , graffiti was scrawled on the partitions , hygiene conditions were , well , less than ideal . so the schools decided to go on the offensive against toilet abusers .
they renovated several of the schools ' restrooms and then put them under guard - not armed , but under the strict watch of so-called klofraue n , women whose job it is to maintain order and cleanliness in public facilities .
they 're a frequent sight in many public toilets , but generally not at schools . however , students and school administrators had just had enough of the execrable state of their lavatories . " the facilities are often in such a condition , that it is just no fun to go to the toilet .
many kids just hold it in , " a speaker for the school district told hessian broadcasting . not anymore .
those students who want to spend their toilet time surrounded by gleaming surfaces and toilet paper dispensers that are always full can cough up the ten cents it now costs to use the new loos . but administrators at the school are not merciless .

" the strategy sets out our objectives to prevent new recruits to terrorism ; better protect potential targets ; pursue and investigate members of existing networks and improve our capability to respond to and manage the consequences of terrorist attacks , " the ministers say in a draft copy of their conclusions . the plan is based on four pillars : cutting the supply of terror recruits , protecting citizens and infrastructure , pursuing and investigating suspects , and responding to the consequences of an attack . in an effort to stop people turning to terror , the bloc has an action plan to combat radicalisation and recruitment , which will include helping and encouraging democracy in northern africa , the middle east and southeast asia . some of the measures though remain vague . bloc missing a common perception of a terror threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some diplomats think the eu measures do n't go far enough the 25-member bloc 's ministers say terrorists must be " deprived as far as possible of the opportunities offered by the internet to communicate and spread technical expertise related to terrorism . "
but they fall short of french demands that member states be given the judicial tools to close down a suspect web site . " the 25 do n't all have the same perception about what constitutes a terrorist threat , " one diplomat said , on condition of anonymity . the ministers also agree on the need to retain telecommunications data , which greatly helped investigators track down suspects in the madrid bombings in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . but they do not agree on how long the information should be kept or who should pay for the costs such an operation might incur . european consensus still some distance away a senior official from britain , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the month , has acknowledged the hurdles that remain .
" the range of views and the difficulty of the issues under examination mean that although i 'm positive and hopeful , it 's not at all certain that we will be able to reach agreement at the council , " he said . " there 's a long range of issues which continue to generate discussion " on the telecommunications data alone , he said on condition of anonymity . " they vary from retention periods , through the handling of costs , through access and how to regulate access to the information , to the question of how you do data retention and data security ... just to take a handful . " questions remain over data retention and security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data retention and security is still a contentious issue the measures would oblige businesses to keep details about callers , such as who they spoke to , where and when , and would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages , and internet protocols . police would not have access to the conversation or message itself . london also wants information about unanswered communications kept - a controversial demand as it would force the industry into extra spending . britain hopes to fast-track a european-wide package of anti-terror measures through the european parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of member states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .
" most want to wait until they have a clear picture of what the consequences of cooperation are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.12.2005 cia affair threatens transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure to find out about secret cia flights in europe is growing reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to . at first it was a muted response .
friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .
" i saw ceremonies for 30 years .
one was different - albertville 92 .
it was a shock that an artist and not a disney type was putting on the show , " heller said . brian eno , a former member of roxy music who has produced albums by u2 and david bowie , will compose a 2006 world cup anthem using instruments from across the world .
former genesis front man peter garbriel will act as musical director . a processio n of world cup wi n n ers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's world cup winner diego maradona will be at the event as well as music and dance , the gala will also feature a total of 132 former world cup winners , including argentina 's 1986 hero diego maradona -lrb- photo -rrb- and brazil 's three-time victor pele .

" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .

some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat .

that is absolutely fatal .

he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .

what is making many gay men throw caution to the wind ? michael was in his early twenties when aids first caused a panic in the gay scene .
everyone talked about the epidemic that killed thousands .

" you tell yourself you 'd be a super responsible gay man , but then situations arise in which you do it without a condom anyway . " though he 's lucky enough to have access to effective antiviral medication that his health insurance pays for and a small state pension because he is too sick to work , michael , now 42 years old , said he realizes that eventually he will probably die of an aids-related disease . some believe hiv is not an issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are about 2.2 million children infected with hiv around the world according to a report from the robert koch institute , the federal government 's disease control center , 1,164 germans were infected in the first half of 2005 with the virus .
almost 60 percent of new infections were among homosexual men .
some 45,000 of the 40 million people living with hiv around the world are german . christopher knoll , a psychologist at munich 's aids-hilfe , an hiv / aids support center , said more gay men are being infected because they no longer consider the disease a serious threat .

" they think they don ’ t have to protect themselves because hiv is not an issue .
that is absolutely fatal .

he said he was completely unprepared for the bad news that would leave him wondering what he could still achieve in his life . " when i got the positive result of the second test i was absolutely crushed , " he said .

i even wonder what my death is going to be like .
i think about death every day . " love , lust and alcohol are the most dangerous obstacles to protection against hiv , according to dr. werner becker , who heads one of germany 's largest gay practices .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .
" i saw ceremonies for 30 years .
one was different - albertville 92 .
it was a shock that an artist and not a disney type was putting on the show , " heller said . brian eno , a former member of roxy music who has produced albums by u2 and david bowie , will compose a 2006 world cup anthem using instruments from across the world .

germany did n't take part in the iraq war , and the hostage is not connected to the military . " susanne ostoff is a civilian , but the terrorists kidnapped her anyway , " he said .
" i deeply abhor this act of terror , and give my deepest sympathy and solidarity to the family and friends of those kidnapped . " meanwhile , new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he has not ruled out that the kidnapping is a criminal , rather than a political , act ; he points to the poor film quality , and the lack of a religious message on the tape . it ca n't be judged the work of criminals on that basis alone , steinmeier said .
but , he added , " i consider it a possible , if not certain , conclusion . " no co n tact with hostage so far , no contact has been made with osthoff through a middleman , and no real progress in the six-day-old case has been made .

theirs are simply " criminal acts against innocent civilians and against peace in iraq , " he said . talaba n i : " we n eed support " iraq needs international support " to keep expanding our security forces , in order to prevent such horrific crimes in the future , and so that the nascent democracy in my country can be a success , " talabani added . wolfgang bosbach , a senior member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said the incident shows that germany is not immune from terrorism .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

a year ago , murat kurnaz left bremen to " see and experience the koran " in pakistan .
since then , he 's been locked up at guantanamo bay , suspected of fighting for the taliban .

since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

politicians and pundits , including bärbel höhn , head of the german parliamentary committee on consumer protection , welcomed the plan and urged quick implementation .
but höhn said even stronger actions are needed to prevent consumers from buying and eating spoiled meat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister horst seehofer made up the 10-point plan seehofer hammered out his agenda , which he made public wednesday , together with ministers from the german states .
in brief , the planned changes call for improved communication , the extension of a registry for lawbreakers to cover the entire european union , and more consistent punishments .
registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .
the ministry expects brussels to approve the creation of an eu-wide system to register firms that have sold spoiled meat as early as this month .
in january , seehofer will meet with state ministers to discuss increased sanctions for rule breakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel höhn : she likes the talk , but wants action in an interview with the berli n er zeitu n g daily , green party politician höhn said she welcomed the government 's plan , but at the same time stressed the need for action .
more i n spectors n eeded the agriculture minister 's plan is " ok .
but words have to be followed by deeds , " she said .
she noted that such plans often get swept under the table once a scandal is off the headlines , adding , " if we do n't put it into effect , then the next scandal is bound to happen . "
she told the rhei n ische post newspaper that the plan to publicize the names of companies that sell spoiled meat is a " great step forward . "
yet she demanded an increase in the number of food inspectors , and warned that a planned law on providing consumer information should apply to industry just as much as the state . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rotten meat ruins consumers ' appetites a crackdown on the meat processing industry in germany has uncovered cases of spoiled frozen food .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .
" i saw ceremonies for 30 years .

but the organizers , aware of the schmaltzy affairs put on to mark the openings of such events as the olympics and the superbowl , want the world cup event to be a classy affair . promising a gala a world away from the parades of superstars and echoes of local themes used at other major sporting events , andre heller , the gala 's austrian artistic director , assured the gathered press at the launch that the line-up would be eclectic and contemporary . " we have an enormous space to fill but we wo n't do it with banal figures , " he said . heller , along with french choreographer philippe decoufle and a creative team featuring british rock musicians brian eno and peter gabriel , announced that popular hip hop band the black eyed peas , algerian singer cheb kahled , and american soprano jessye norman will be among those providing the music at the first world cup gala in fifa 's 100-year history . a first for fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer ceremonies usually open tournaments before the first match previous world cups have held opening ceremonies which typically lasted about an hour immediately before the first match .
the 2006 world cup will start what world governing body fifa hopes will be a new tradition - a separate festivity to mark the start of the tournament . heller is hoping that french avant-garde choreographer decoufle brings the creativity and inspiration that made his surreal cirque du soleil-style opening and closing ceremonies at the 1992 winter olympics in albertville such a success . the show , directed by the frenchman , featured a polka with braying donkey sounds mixed with fiddles and figures emerging from the sky , including suspended ski jumpers and an angel to put out the flame . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : decoufle 's 1992 cirque de soleil performance caught andre heller 's eye .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .

this week the " bremen taliban " celebrated a small legal victory . it 's not the release kurnaz and his family were hoping for , but an administrative court 's decision on wednesday not to reject the bremen 's youth 's residency permit allows him to re-enter the country once he 's freed from guantanamo bay . the interior minister of bremen , where kurnaz was born and raised , had revoked his residency permit because kurnaz was not around to register himself .
the 22-year-old has been imprisoned in us custody on guantanamo bay since being turned over to us soldiers near the pakistani-afghani border in october 2001 .
lawyer bernhard docke , who has been working since then to free him , called this week 's decision an important step .
" through this decision the administrative court shows clearly that the law can not be based on injustice and that german law wo n't import the ghost of guantanamo , " he said in a statement . us judge backs his case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lawyer bernhard docke has been fighting tirelessly for kurnaz 's release though many of the prisoners held on the us military base in cuba have since been released , kurnaz is still considered an " enemy combatant " by the us state department .
us officials charge the bremen resident with traveling to pakistan in october 2001 in order to wage armed combat against american forces in afghanistan .
but docke and kurnaz 's family maintain that he was only going to pakistan to visit quran schools , and was not even in afghanistan , much less holding a gun , when turned over to us forces . their argument was bolstered earlier this year by us district court judge joyce hens green , who singled out kurnaz 's case as an extreme example of illegal detention .
since then , there has been little movement on his case , despite evidence that exonerates him , say his lawyers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz 's mother , rabiye , has traveled to washington dc to take part in demonstrations recently declassified evidence seen by lawyer baher azmy reveal that the us government 's " command information task force has no definite link / evidence of detainee having an association with al qaeda or making a specific threat toward the us . " allegatio n s of torture german officials doubted the charges almost immediately after his capture .
though he visited a bremen mosque on the watch list of local law enforcement for suspected extremist views , officials found no connection between kurnaz and the islamic fundamentalist scene .
the bremen prosecutor abandoned an investigation into kurnaz and his friend selcuk bilgin , who accompanied him as far as frankfurt airport for lack of evidence in 2002 . unlike france , sweden and britain in cases involving nationals of their countries imprisoned in guantanamo , the german government has so far involved itself minimally in kurnaz 's case because he holds turkish citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former detainees say torture and inhumane treatment are routine at the base in the meantime , azmy - who visited kurnaz in guantanamo in january 2005 - said he has endured inhuman treatment , including torture , following his capture and during his detainment . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .

no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations . " our governments are puzzled , " said henning riecke , an expert on transatlantic relations and security policy at german council on foreign relations .
" it is a dangerous challenge to the values we try to defend in our war on terror such as the rule of law .
we see guantanamo and other prisons and see that it is easy for the prime defender of these values , the us , to forget about them .
and then we have to ask , what behavior can we expect in the future ? " he added that europeans have looked the other way as americans transport suspects to nations that use interrogations methods illegal in the us and europe .
but now , the fact that this might be happening in europe is making people nervous . " people are asking , ' how can it be that human rights activists are placing responsibility for such conduct on germany , too , " ' he said .
" we need clarification as to whether our governments knew or not . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is cooperation on security threatened ?
it also might lead to a slowing of cooperation between the us and its european allies on security concerns and intelligence sharing , experts said .
such political and security cooperation increased in the past year , particularly over the iran weapons issue . europeans officials feel broadsided by the issue , security experts say . " there is still interest in ongoing cooperation but only if the suspicion is eliminated that the cia has betrayed its european partners , " said riecke .
" most want to wait until they have a clear picture of what the consequences of cooperation are .
that should not include making an arrest and then turning over the suspect to be tortured .

politicians and pundits , including bärbel höhn , head of the german parliamentary committee on consumer protection , welcomed the plan and urged quick implementation .
but höhn said even stronger actions are needed to prevent consumers from buying and eating spoiled meat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister horst seehofer made up the 10-point plan seehofer hammered out his agenda , which he made public wednesday , together with ministers from the german states .
in brief , the planned changes call for improved communication , the extension of a registry for lawbreakers to cover the entire european union , and more consistent punishments .
registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .
the ministry expects brussels to approve the creation of an eu-wide system to register firms that have sold spoiled meat as early as this month .
in january , seehofer will meet with state ministers to discuss increased sanctions for rule breakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel höhn : she likes the talk , but wants action in an interview with the berli n er zeitu n g daily , green party politician höhn said she welcomed the government 's plan , but at the same time stressed the need for action .
more i n spectors n eeded the agriculture minister 's plan is " ok .
but words have to be followed by deeds , " she said .
she noted that such plans often get swept under the table once a scandal is off the headlines , adding , " if we do n't put it into effect , then the next scandal is bound to happen . "
she told the rhei n ische post newspaper that the plan to publicize the names of companies that sell spoiled meat is a " great step forward . "
yet she demanded an increase in the number of food inspectors , and warned that a planned law on providing consumer information should apply to industry just as much as the state . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rotten meat ruins consumers ' appetites a crackdown on the meat processing industry in germany has uncovered cases of spoiled frozen food .

politicians and pundits , including bärbel höhn , head of the german parliamentary committee on consumer protection , welcomed the plan and urged quick implementation .
but höhn said even stronger actions are needed to prevent consumers from buying and eating spoiled meat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture minister horst seehofer made up the 10-point plan seehofer hammered out his agenda , which he made public wednesday , together with ministers from the german states .
in brief , the planned changes call for improved communication , the extension of a registry for lawbreakers to cover the entire european union , and more consistent punishments .
registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .
the ministry expects brussels to approve the creation of an eu-wide system to register firms that have sold spoiled meat as early as this month .
in january , seehofer will meet with state ministers to discuss increased sanctions for rule breakers .

but words have to be followed by deeds , " she said .
she noted that such plans often get swept under the table once a scandal is off the headlines , adding , " if we do n't put it into effect , then the next scandal is bound to happen . "
she told the rhei n ische post newspaper that the plan to publicize the names of companies that sell spoiled meat is a " great step forward . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.12.2005 cia affair threatens transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure to find out about secret cia flights in europe is growing reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to . at first it was a muted response .
friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.12.2005 cia affair threatens transatlantic relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure to find out about secret cia flights in europe is growing reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to . at first it was a muted response .
friso roscam abbing , spokesman for justice and security affairs for the european commission , said that the body did " not see any reason now to ask for further clarification at this point in time " regarding the existence of secret cia prisons in eastern europe after word leaked out in early november . but european politicians , wary of another rift with the us only a few years after disagreements over the iraq war led to postwar lows in the transatlantic relationship , couldn ’ t stop the grumbling of the public , the media or the independent council of europe , which decided to open an investigation . then events hit even closer to home : six european countries , including sweden and spain , have opened investigations into whether the cia used their airspace and airports for secret flights to transport suspected terrorists .
germany alone , according to news reports , can count as many as 80 flights , including instances where officials believe suspects may have been interrogated or tortured . but on wednesday , the incoming head of the german intelligence service said it still had no proof that airports in germany were used by the cia to transport terror suspects to secret prisons . " we have no proof , no facts .
there are only rumors , " ernst uhrlau told die zeit weekly , according to an advance excerpt . foreign affairs headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trying to balance improving relations with clarification still , the issue has given new german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier his first headache .
in washington on tuesday , he had to balance pressure by german officials for clarification over the issue while also trying to fulfill new german chancellor angela merkel ’ s wish for warmer relations . " what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday .
but he trod lightly in washington and declined to reveal the details of what he and us officials discussed . regardless , momentum for answers is building , with some german officials like their european counterparts elsewhere saying " finally . " " it took almost a month for eu countries to wake up and begin questioning what has been in the papers and in the minds of the public for weeks , " said one german official involved in foreign relations .
" but people didn ’ t want to antagonize the americans .
now it looks like we might have to . " european lawmakers are to renew calls on thursday for a formal eu investigation into the allegations . prisons most likely in poland , romania it began in early november after the washington post reported the existence of secret cia prisons in eight european and asian countries , which housed suspected terrorists .
although the post didn ’ t identify the countries , a washington , dc-based ngo , human rights watch , said that evidence points to poland and romania as the likeliest european locations of the prisons .
both countries have pointedly denied the allegation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini promises consequences for countries allowing prisons on their soil this could have serious consequences for any country found to have allowed such prisons .
european union justice commissioner franco frattini issued his strongest worded warning this week by threatening sanctions on any eu state that has the jails because it would violate eu human rights accords .
non-eu members such as romania , which hopes to join in 2007 , could come under pressure to demonstrate their accordance with eu standards . " should the accusations be accurate , i would be forced to draw serious consequences , " frattini said , speaking to reporters at a security conference in berlin this week .
he added that this could include the suspension of the voting rights in the council of ministers , the body which groups the 25 eu heads of government .
no member has ever had their voting rights suspended . in addition to a formal inquiry sent to the us by british foreign secretary jack straw on behalf of the eu , the council of europe has sent a mandatory questionnaire to its 46 members , asking about such detentions from 2002 . a spokesman for the council said that the investigation is not solely limited to the secret prisons but into any illegal detention of us prisoners in europe . meanwhile , the issue has threatened a rift between european countries as well with some questioning how well some of their neighbors adhere to the conventions they have promised to uphold as members of the council of europe and the eu . us maintains silence so far eu officials say that although they have solicited answers in the past week regarding the prisons and flights , they haven ’ t received any word from washington that the allegations are untrue . instead , american officials have continued to maintain that that the us will continue to do what it thinks necessary to fight the war on terrorism even as they have admitted to feeling under pressure to offer up some clarification . experts say that is likely to lead to a strain on transatlantic relations .

registry system is key seehofer also said the justice department should start inquiries into the matter , and demanded more financing for inspections .
the plan will be put into effect immediately , a spokesman for the ministry said .
the ministry expects brussels to approve the creation of an eu-wide system to register firms that have sold spoiled meat as early as this month .
in january , seehofer will meet with state ministers to discuss increased sanctions for rule breakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bärbel höhn : she likes the talk , but wants action in an interview with the berli n er zeitu n g daily , green party politician höhn said she welcomed the government 's plan , but at the same time stressed the need for action .
more i n spectors n eeded the agriculture minister 's plan is " ok .
but words have to be followed by deeds , " she said .
she noted that such plans often get swept under the table once a scandal is off the headlines , adding , " if we do n't put it into effect , then the next scandal is bound to happen . "
she told the rhei n ische post newspaper that the plan to publicize the names of companies that sell spoiled meat is a " great step forward . "
yet she demanded an increase in the number of food inspectors , and warned that a planned law on providing consumer information should apply to industry just as much as the state . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rotten meat ruins consumers ' appetites a crackdown on the meat processing industry in germany has uncovered cases of spoiled frozen food .

with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .
have they all completely lost their minds ? ! !
since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

since reagan -lrb- where cheney was also a member of the ' team ' -rrb- any republican government is dragging the world further back into the middle ages ! – tobi do we have something in common with the americans or with the terrorists ?
do we expect the americans to put these people in 5-star hotels ?
we in europe are trying together to solve the iranian problem with americans and at the same time accusing them .
why ?
one thing some of us have seen is that governments or regimes in the middle east have more respect for the americans than for us in europe , for they know that the americans do what they say and what do we do is nothing at all .
i think the best for us is to support the americans threat of force while we at the same time try diplomacy . climate change bildunterschrift : the u.s. and china , as well as all human beings , should implement drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions , as well as all other environmentally harmful practices .
unfortunately , our popular cultures have embraced common ideologies that blind us to our roles in nature , and disguise the fact that all of our actions profoundly affect climate , eco-systems , and our troposphere .
leaders of nearly all countries place a premium on strong market economies , which are based on ever growing consumption .
these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .
basing " success " of a people on economic indicators such as gdp and gnp , pits us against our own life-sustaining systems .
this is a " live for the moment " attitude that is essentially suicidal .
i resent those in power who make decisions that destroy this planet which belongs to all creatures , just to satisfy their greed . i am ashamed by my county 's president 's continued arrogance , ignorance and selfish disregard in the face of the obvious . – usa of course the united states , china and india should also commit to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases .
the greatest commitment should come from the united states , the greatest polluter in the history of human kind . compiled by dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia affair threatens transatlantic relations reports of secret cia prisons in europe and clandestine cia flights are forcing reluctant european officials to begin asking americans questions more forcefully than they initially wanted to .

with iraq , iran and climate talks on the agenda , there 's room for improvement , they argue . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . cia prisons in europe are there secret cia prisons in romania and poland ?
probably .
heck those prisons must be somewhere or the cia would n't have been flying these people all over the place . what i 'm wondering is why ms. merkel wants to kiss up to bush when the whole world hates that guy .
this woman surely ai n't for real .
why visit with the guy ?
if ms. merkel had any morals at all , she would ignore the bush-regime .
does this woman realize that bush invaded iraq , dismantled the military there , and has had our military fight a war against iraqi civilians of all stripes for nearly 3 years by now ?
what kind of a war is that , i 'd like to ask ?
normally for a military to fight against civilians is called genocide .
it 's nice that germany has a female chancellor but why this callous woman who obviously fancies herself another blair-poodle ? i am certain the allegations are true , especially with regard to poland , finland , and romania who may not realize the seriousness of the crime they are perpetrating by letting themselves be satraps of the us . i am extremely worried about the news on secret prisons and violation of human rights .
even more so because cheney has also claimed that torture should be allowed when committed under cia supervision .

these expanding levels of consumption will , in the end , destroy the very environment that sustains life .
it 's time to grow up , discard our adolescent hedonism in the dustbins of the past and behave as if our lives really depend on preservation , conservation , clean energy , and sustainable practices in all of our endeavours , because that is precisely the case .

phonics is an accepted part of the government 's recommended approach to teaching literacy and few now argue over whether or not it should be used .
instead the debate is about which type of phonics works best : analytic or synthetic .
so how do they differ ?
analytic phonics is already in widespread use .
it breaks down words into phonetic beginnings and endings . "
many teachers fear it does not suit all children 's learning styles and argue it is so mechanistic it can destroy the joy of reading " mike baker reading set for overhaul in the jargon , this is called " onset and rime " .
so , for example , the word street would be broken into two parts : " str " and " eet " .
by contrast , synthetic phonics is more prescriptive .
before children are introduced to books , they have an intensive period of learning the 44 letter and letter-combination sounds in the english language .
they then use these to construct words .
so , in our example of the word street , they would build it up from all its constituent sounds : s- t- r- ee- t .
advocates of synthetic phonics say children should be taught this method fast , first and only .
it is this which makes the method controversial : it is , in effect , an all-your-eggs-in-one-basket approach .
many teachers fear it does not suit all children 's learning styles and argue it is so mechanistic it can destroy the joy of reading .
politicised issue but an experiment with synthetic phonics in clackmannanshire in scotland has reported strong gains .
it found that children taught this way were seven months ahead at the end of their second year at school .
by the end of their seventh year in school , they were still ahead in reading comprehension although the lead had been halved .
earlier this year the commons education committee called for a larger-scale study of phonics and the issue became politicised when the conservatives backed the calls for the introduction of synthetic phonics .
this prompted the government to invite former senior schools inspector jim rose to conduct the independent review whose interim recommendations are published on thursday .
the government lists 45 phonemes and example words -lrb- although some experts say there are 44 phonemes -rrb- as follows : vowels and representative words / a / c a t / e / p e g , br ea d / i / p i g , want e d / o / l o g , w a nt / u / pl u g , l o ve / ae / p ai n , d ay , g a t e , st a tion / ee / sw ee t , h ea t , th ie f , th e s e / ie / tr ie d , l igh t , m y , sh i n e , m i nd / oe / r oa d , bl o w , b o n e , c o ld / ue / m oo n , bl ue , gr ew , t u n e / oo / l oo k , w ou ld , p u t / ar / c ar t , f a st -lrb- regional -rrb- / ur / b ur n , f ir st , t er m / or / t or n , d oor , w ar n -lrb- regional -rrb- / au / h au l , l aw , c a ll / er / circ u s , sist er / ow / d ow n , sh ou t / oi / c oi n , b oy / air / st air s , b ear , h are / ear / f ear , b eer , h ere consonant phonemes and representative words / b / b a b y / d / d og / f / f ield , ph oto / g / g ame / h / h at / j / j u dge , g iant , bar ge / k / c oo k , q ui ck , mi x , ch ris / l / l amb / m / m onkey , co mb / n / n ut , kn ife , gn at / p / p aper / r / r abbit , wr ong / s / s un , mou se , c ity , sc ien ce / t / t ap / v / v an / w / w as / wh / wh ere -lrb- regional -rrb- / y / y es / z / z ebra , plea se , i s / th / th en / th / th in / ch / ch ip , wa tch / sh / sh ip , mi ss ion , ch ef / zh / trea s ure / ng / ri ng , si n k e-mail this to a friend related to this story : primary reading set for overhaul -lrb- 01 dec 05 -pipe- education -rrb- phonics plan for literacy review -lrb- 26 jul 05 -pipe- education -rrb- kelly planning catch-up lessons -lrb- 26 jul 05 -pipe- education -rrb- spelling out success in reading -lrb- 03 jun 05 -pipe- education -rrb- new reading system wins backing -lrb- 26 aug 05 -pipe- scotland -rrb- related internet links department for education and skills read write inc .

about seven others are still said to be missing , amid conflicting reports about how many people were in the mine .
the coal dust explosion at the dongfeng mine in heilongjiang province destroyed the mine 's ventilation system .
accidents remain widespread in china 's mines , despite a much-publicised government safety campaign .
police arrested the head of the mine , ma jinguang , and local communist party secretary chen zhiqiang , the china daily newspaper reported .
ma jinguang had been declared a role model in mine management 10 days before the accident , the paper added .
before the arrests were made known , the national work safety watchdog publicly rebuked the mine 's management for failing to act on warning signs in the run-up to the explosion .
police and mine investigators have reportedly taken away documents , minutes of meetings and account records from the offices of the mine , which is run by heilongjiang longmei mining group , a state-owned conglomerate .
some 72 miners have so far been rescued alive since sunday 's blast , 38 of whom are being treated in hospital , xinhua news agency says .
officials were quoted as saying the chances of finding more survivors were very low because of the levels of toxic gas in the mine .
' unsafe mines ' china has the worst mine safety record in the world .
chinese officials say some 6,000 miners died last year , but non-government groups say the true figure is far higher .
this year , 3,000 deaths have been reported in the country 's mines .
the china daily newspaper said that following the government drive to increase safety , 9,000 illegal coal mines have been closed since september and almost 13,000 dangerous ones suspended .
but the paper admitted that the central government 's attempts to improve safety were being compromised by local authorities ignoring unsafe mines because they made money .

about seven others are still said to be missing , amid conflicting reports about how many people were in the mine .
the coal dust explosion at the dongfeng mine in heilongjiang province destroyed the mine 's ventilation system .
accidents remain widespread in china 's mines , despite a much-publicised government safety campaign .
police arrested the head of the mine , ma jinguang , and local communist party secretary chen zhiqiang , the china daily newspaper reported .
ma jinguang had been declared a role model in mine management 10 days before the accident , the paper added .
before the arrests were made known , the national work safety watchdog publicly rebuked the mine 's management for failing to act on warning signs in the run-up to the explosion .
police and mine investigators have reportedly taken away documents , minutes of meetings and account records from the offices of the mine , which is run by heilongjiang longmei mining group , a state-owned conglomerate .
some 72 miners have so far been rescued alive since sunday 's blast , 38 of whom are being treated in hospital , xinhua news agency says .
officials were quoted as saying the chances of finding more survivors were very low because of the levels of toxic gas in the mine .
' unsafe mines ' china has the worst mine safety record in the world .
chinese officials say some 6,000 miners died last year , but non-government groups say the true figure is far higher .
this year , 3,000 deaths have been reported in the country 's mines .
the china daily newspaper said that following the government drive to increase safety , 9,000 illegal coal mines have been closed since september and almost 13,000 dangerous ones suspended .
but the paper admitted that the central government 's attempts to improve safety were being compromised by local authorities ignoring unsafe mines because they made money .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- doubt cast on falconio cctv film bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 1 december 2005 , 08:16 gmt doubt cast on falconio cctv film the man accused of killing briton peter falconio has a different build to a man captured on cctv hours after the 2001 attack , an australian court has heard .
body structure expert professor maciej henneberg also told the darwin court the cctv images from an alice springs truck stop were of " very poor quality " .
another defence expert also raised " concerns " about some dna evidence .
bradley murdoch , 47 , denies murdering mr falconio and kidnapping and attacking his girlfriend joanne lees .
prof henneberg , the head of anatomical science at the university of adelaide , said on thursday he had compared the cctv footage with pictures of the defendant taken between 1995 and 2005 . "
it 's impossible ... to reach 100 % certainty in comparisons of images which are not very good quality " prof henneberg asked by the defence what his assessment of the images was , he told the northern territory supreme court the images showed a man of a particular body build .
he assessed this to be a lean body build , and with a body size of medium to medium large , but not excessively large .
" what i could tell was that the person of interest in the cctv image and mr murdoch differed in their body build and probably in their overall size and stature . "
mr murdoch is around 6ft 5in , the court heard .
prof henneberg , an expert in variations in human body structure and a visiting fellow at oxford university , said he disagreed with earlier evidence by forensic expert dr meiya sutisno .
she had told the court mr murdoch shared several distinctive face and body characteristics with the man captured on the video footage .
they shared features including sloping shoulders , long torso , jaw , chin and walking manner , she had said .
but prof henneberg cast doubt on dr sutisno 's conclusions and also accused her of using several scientific terms incorrectly during her evidence .
" it 's impossible , except where there is some peculiar disfiguration or anatomical anomaly , to reach 100 % certainty in comparisons of images which are not very good quality . "
however , during cross-examination by rex wild , qc , the director of public prosecutors , the professor admitted dr sutisno carried out further enhancement of the images which he had not undertaken .
" she uses the same basic principles of comparing images feature by feature , so to that extent that 's the same procedure .
" i used the original images .
i never manipulate images that i receive . "
dna doubts but he admitted that dr sutisno had different methods and could " see more " .
on wednesday , the court heard mr murdoch say even his own father had thought he looked like the man pictured on cctv .
on thursday , doubt was also cast on dna evidence the prosecution had presented claiming a sample on the handcuffs used to tie up miss lees was 100 million times more likely to come from the defendant than anyone else .
dr katrin both , part-time forensic scientists at the forensic science service in adelaide , said she had a " large number of concerns " about the tests used .
the method was " very dangerous " and pushed " science to the limits " , she said .
miss lees , of brighton , sussex , has told the court she and mr falconio were flagged down by mr murdoch while they were driving across the outback .
he is then alleged to have shot mr falconio , of huddersfield , west yorkshire , and bundled his girlfriend into the back of his van , before she escaped and hid in the undergrowth .
mr murdoch has denied this under cross-examination .
the trial continues .

body structure expert professor maciej henneberg also told the darwin court the cctv images from an alice springs truck stop were of " very poor quality " .
another defence expert also raised " concerns " about some dna evidence .
bradley murdoch , 47 , denies murdering mr falconio and kidnapping and attacking his girlfriend joanne lees .
prof henneberg , the head of anatomical science at the university of adelaide , said on thursday he had compared the cctv footage with pictures of the defendant taken between 1995 and 2005 .
it 's impossible ... to reach 100 % certainty in comparisons of images which are not very good quality prof henneberg asked by the defence what his assessment of the images was , he told the northern territory supreme court the images showed a man of a particular body build .
he assessed this to be a lean body build , and with a body size of medium to medium large , but not excessively large .
" what i could tell was that the person of interest in the cctv image and mr murdoch differed in their body build and probably in their overall size and stature . "
mr murdoch is around 6ft 5in , the court heard .
prof henneberg , an expert in variations in human body structure and a visiting fellow at oxford university , said he disagreed with earlier evidence by forensic expert dr meiya sutisno .
she had told the court mr murdoch shared several distinctive face and body characteristics with the man captured on the video footage .
joanne lees and peter falconio were travelling across australia they shared features including sloping shoulders , long torso , jaw , chin and walking manner , she had said .
but prof henneberg cast doubt on dr sutisno 's conclusions and also accused her of using several scientific terms incorrectly during her evidence .
" it 's impossible , except where there is some peculiar disfiguration or anatomical anomaly , to reach 100 % certainty in comparisons of images which are not very good quality . "
however , during cross-examination by rex wild , qc , the director of public prosecutors , the professor admitted dr sutisno carried out further enhancement of the images which he had not undertaken .
" she uses the same basic principles of comparing images feature by feature , so to that extent that 's the same procedure .
" i used the original images .
i never manipulate images that i receive . "
dna doubts but he admitted that dr sutisno had different methods and could " see more " .
on wednesday , the court heard mr murdoch say even his own father had thought he looked like the man pictured on cctv .
on thursday , doubt was also cast on dna evidence the prosecution had presented claiming a sample on the handcuffs used to tie up miss lees was 100 million times more likely to come from the defendant than anyone else .
dr katrin both , part-time forensic scientists at the forensic science service in adelaide , said she had a " large number of concerns " about the tests used .
the method was " very dangerous " and pushed " science to the limits " , she said .
miss lees , of brighton , sussex , has told the court she and mr falconio were flagged down by mr murdoch while they were driving across the outback .
he is then alleged to have shot mr falconio , of huddersfield , west yorkshire , and bundled his girlfriend into the back of his van , before she escaped and hid in the undergrowth .
mr murdoch has denied this under cross-examination .

serj horoshikh is one of 20,000 people living with hiv in moscow alone .
he got infected 10 years ago , aged 18 .
he told me he had been injecting drugs at the time .
" there was zero information .
aids was just an abbreviation , it did n't mean anything , " he said .
" all people of my generation who were injecting drugs got infected .
no one escaped . "
for people like serj , there was little help from the authorities , who were in virtual denial that aids could exist in russia .
what official resources there were available focused on treatment not prevention .
serj is now working for an aids charity , providing information through his internet magazine to thousands of people across russia .
according to official statistics , at the end of last year russia had around 340,000 registered people living with hiv .
but it is widely acknowledged that the figure could be at least four times higher .
to date , more than 7,500 people have died of aids in russia .
the rate of infection is spiralling upwards .
women at risk russia now has the fastest-growing aids epidemic in europe - every day 100 new hiv positive infections are registered .
the problem is no longer limited to injecting drug users . "
now our president and our government have promised to spend 10 or 15 times as much money for the struggle against hiv infection " vadim pokrovsky russia 's federal aids programme the disease is moving into the wider population .
and it is women who are being hardest hit .
last year , roughly 40 % of all new registered cases of hiv were women , most of whom are of childbearing age .
up until recently , the russian government was spending less than 10 cents per person every year on aids prevention programmes .
but things are beginning to change .
at the launch of the un aids report last week , the head of russia 's federal aids programme , vadim pokrovsky , confirmed that the government will massively increase its aids budget next year .
" now our president and our government have promised to spend 10 times or 15 times as much money for the struggle against hiv infection and we hope that at the end of next year we can announce that there will be some success , " he said .
russia , it seems , is finally waking up to the problem .
it can not afford to be complacent any more .
but it will take more than just money to change attitudes and raise awareness about a disease that will eventually claim many more thousands of lives .

serj horoshikh is one of 20,000 people living with hiv in moscow alone .
he got infected 10 years ago , aged 18 .
he told me he had been injecting drugs at the time .
" there was zero information .
aids was just an abbreviation , it did n't mean anything , " he said .
" all people of my generation who were injecting drugs got infected .
no one escaped . "
for people like serj , there was little help from the authorities , who were in virtual denial that aids could exist in russia .
what official resources there were available focused on treatment not prevention .
serj is now working for an aids charity , providing information through his internet magazine to thousands of people across russia .
according to official statistics , at the end of last year russia had around 340,000 registered people living with hiv .
but it is widely acknowledged that the figure could be at least four times higher .
to date , more than 7,500 people have died of aids in russia .
the rate of infection is spiralling upwards .
women at risk russia now has the fastest-growing aids epidemic in europe - every day 100 new hiv positive infections are registered .
the problem is no longer limited to injecting drug users .
now our president and our government have promised to spend 10 or 15 times as much money for the struggle against hiv infection vadim pokrovsky russia 's federal aids programme the disease is moving into the wider population .
and it is women who are being hardest hit .
last year , roughly 40 % of all new registered cases of hiv were women , most of whom are of childbearing age .
up until recently , the russian government was spending less than 10 cents per person every year on aids prevention programmes .
but things are beginning to change .
at the launch of the un aids report last week , the head of russia 's federal aids programme , vadim pokrovsky , confirmed that the government will massively increase its aids budget next year .
" now our president and our government have promised to spend 10 times or 15 times as much money for the struggle against hiv infection and we hope that at the end of next year we can announce that there will be some success , " he said .
russia , it seems , is finally waking up to the problem .
it can not afford to be complacent any more .
but it will take more than just money to change attitudes and raise awareness about a disease that will eventually claim many more thousands of lives .

serj horoshikh is one of 20,000 people living with hiv in moscow alone .
he got infected 10 years ago , aged 18 .
he told me he had been injecting drugs at the time .
" there was zero information .
aids was just an abbreviation , it did n't mean anything , " he said .
" all people of my generation who were injecting drugs got infected .
no one escaped . "
for people like serj , there was little help from the authorities , who were in virtual denial that aids could exist in russia .
what official resources there were available focused on treatment not prevention .
serj is now working for an aids charity , providing information through his internet magazine to thousands of people across russia .
according to official statistics , at the end of last year russia had around 340,000 registered people living with hiv .
but it is widely acknowledged that the figure could be at least four times higher .
to date , more than 7,500 people have died of aids in russia .
the rate of infection is spiralling upwards .
women at risk russia now has the fastest-growing aids epidemic in europe - every day 100 new hiv positive infections are registered .
the problem is no longer limited to injecting drug users .
now our president and our government have promised to spend 10 or 15 times as much money for the struggle against hiv infection vadim pokrovsky russia 's federal aids programme the disease is moving into the wider population .
and it is women who are being hardest hit .
last year , roughly 40 % of all new registered cases of hiv were women , most of whom are of childbearing age .
up until recently , the russian government was spending less than 10 cents per person every year on aids prevention programmes .
but things are beginning to change .
at the launch of the un aids report last week , the head of russia 's federal aids programme , vadim pokrovsky , confirmed that the government will massively increase its aids budget next year .
" now our president and our government have promised to spend 10 times or 15 times as much money for the struggle against hiv infection and we hope that at the end of next year we can announce that there will be some success , " he said .
russia , it seems , is finally waking up to the problem .
it can not afford to be complacent any more .
but it will take more than just money to change attitudes and raise awareness about a disease that will eventually claim many more thousands of lives .
