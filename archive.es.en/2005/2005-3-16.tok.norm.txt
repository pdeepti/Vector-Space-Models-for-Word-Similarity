spiridon paraskewopoulos says the current attempt at a paradigm shift from a german to a us mentality is the wrong approach . " germans and europeans generally have more faith in their governments than the americans do , and the government should not be trying to change the germans from that which they are , " paraskewopoulos said . he apportions at least part of the blame to the press .
" the media is constantly trumpeting the fact that germany is in crisis and , just as telling a healthy man that he is sick will ultimately lead him to believe it , germans have come to consider themselves down on their luck .
the press should take a different approach to stimulate positive change in germany , " he added . where are the big spenders ? paraskewopoulos argues that as much as being about a mindset , the current economic and employment situation in germany is the result of a reluctance to spend .
" people have been bullied into feeling insecure about their futures and have thus stopped consuming .
they need to spend rather than sit on their savings and start encouraging domestic growth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for the next generation ?

thomas bausch works on a project called " exist , " promoting the notion of entrepreneurialism in universities across the country .
he says that germans have to loosen their grip on their employment ideal of a job for life at a big name business . " people associate a career at places such as siemens or bosch or in the public service with social prestige and do n't even consider the idea of working for themselves , " bausch said . he maintains that the upcoming generation of workers is not only having to grapple with the continued prejudice dating from the 1960s that entrepreneurs are immoral , exploitative capitalists , but are also living with an inherited fear of trying something different . " people are terrified of failing , not only because it is hard to get a second chance and a second business loan here in germany , " he said .
" they also do n't want to live with the social stigma of having tried and failed . "
the adage " nothing ventured , nothing gained " might not have widespread acceptance in germany , but with projects such as exist and government-funded self-starter programs , there are signs that a gentle breeze of change is beginning to blow . tamsin walker , dw-online.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de five million germans jobless germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

the president of the organisation , peter eigen , said the money which flows into the war-torn country has to be protected .
the report cited the scandal-ridden un oil for food program and highlighted the fact that bribery is endemic in today 's iraq . the chairman of transparency international germany , hans-jörg elshorst , criticised the lack of tender offers for construction contacts , which he said are often administered directly through the us government and simply given to large companies . " it is all very unusual , and that is why we 're so critical , " elshorst told reuters tv . poor construction endangers lives in the report , the international ngo says that bribery affects both industrial and developing nations , resulting in money waste and poor construction quality , which in turn endangers human life .
for the awarding of contracts , the organisation called for greater transparency , fairer competition and the exclusion from bidding of those companies who have either paid or offered a backhander . when it comes to germany , elshorst had praise for the progress made in the battle against corruption .
he said that although the level of corruption has gone down over the past two years , there is still a " large dark figure , " which he estimates to be in the " tens of billions . " in a table of 30 industrial states , germany has fallen from place 20 to place 15 , but the transparency international chairman said that is not good enough , particularly when compared with a country like britain , which ranks at place eleven . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?

" i can not but express my dissatisfaction with this conclusion , " sanader told the european parliament in brussels . he also maintained that his government had fully cooperated with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , which is seeking the arrest of fugitive croatian general ante gotovina . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , however stressed wednesday that he was " fully convinced " that eu entry talks with croatia could begin " in the course of the next weeks . " " i 'm fully convinced that in the course of the next weeks , croatia will be able to prove that she is cooperating closely and entirely with the international tribunal -lrb- un war crimes court -rrb- and that then immediately the decision for the starting of negotiations can be taken , " he said . as expected , eu foreign ministers agreed that the bloc can not start talks as planned on thursday because the ex-yugoslav country has not provided enough help in the hunt for gotovina , according to diplomats . wanted for murder gotovina , a 49-year-old retired general , is considered a war hero by many croatians but is wanted by the un war crimes court for the alleged murder of at least 150 ethnic serbs during the final stages of croatia 's 1991-95 war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passers-by walk in front of a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect gen. ante gotovina , in croatian town of knin .
he is also accused of plundering serbs ' property during the war , when serb rebels opposed croatia 's breakaway from the former yugoslavia . most of the eu 's 25 member states remained opposed to giving a go-ahead until gotovina is physically handed over to the icty in the hague . croatia , hoping to be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu as early as 2007 - slovenia became the first last may - was told in december that it could in theory start talks with brussels on march 17 . but that green light was conditional on providing " full cooperation " with icty chief prosecutor carla del ponte - who reiterated tuesday that this was not the case . sanader however insisted wednesday that " croatia has in the past fully cooperated . " " i ca n't be happy -lrb- with the delay -rrb- but it 's a good sign that a negotiating framework was adopted , " he added . not a snub despite the snub the eu 's luxembourg presidency insisted that its " door remains open " to croatia , and sought to play down the significance of the thumbs-down . " in any case the door to the eu will be open , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn as he arrived for the talks .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen .

" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?

she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : feeding asia 's giant with arms and autos us , eu on collision course over china arms , cars top schröder ’ s china trip chinese carmakers eye europe german parliament rejects arms sales to china europe -pipe- 16.03.2005 china weapons embargo full of holes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where did they come from ?
the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .

to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .

" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .

people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .

" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 nothing ventured , nothing gained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing an innovative approach to job seeking is a slow process as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates . more than five million unemployed - 5.22 million in february , to be exact - is very bad news for germany .
it 's impossible to deny the severity of the problem afflicting the nation 's labor landscape .
there is no quick fix and , many of those affected would say , little prospect for a solution in the medium term .
in short , resignation has set in . when it comes to germans and employment , the national mindset allows them to feel justified in expecting the state to provide them the opportunity to make an honest living .
when it then becomes difficult to access that perceived national right , they often feel insulted and lapse into a kind of sullen lethargy .
klaus boehnke , a professor of social science methodology at the international university in bremen , says germans are intrinsically reluctant to take the bull by the horns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall did n't divide everything " in germany we have two sources for the current inactivity .
there 's the example from the east where the state took care of everything , making it unnecessary for citizens to do anything for themselves , " he said .
" while in the west , the success of the social market economy led people to grow lethargic in the belief that the only way forward is up . " living in a bureaucratic box in essence , people have grown used to living and working inside boxes and unused to thinking too far outside of them , which , in the case of unemployment , presents a very real problem .
the job search can take on many faces , but the german seeker often seems plagued by a lack of imagination and exhibits a tendency to look for work from within the bureaucratic outlook so prevalent in german society . " this behavior dates back to the dominance of the prussian authorities in which people were taught to think and behave according to rules and order , " professor boehnke said .
indeed , instigating change will require a radically sweeping rethink , which will take at least a generation to trickle into effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry of harmonized thinking economic theorist and author of the book " was ist bloss mit den deutschen ? "
-lrb- what 's up with the germans ? -rrb-
spiridon paraskewopoulos says the current attempt at a paradigm shift from a german to a us mentality is the wrong approach . " germans and europeans generally have more faith in their governments than the americans do , and the government should not be trying to change the germans from that which they are , " paraskewopoulos said . he apportions at least part of the blame to the press .
" the media is constantly trumpeting the fact that germany is in crisis and , just as telling a healthy man that he is sick will ultimately lead him to believe it , germans have come to consider themselves down on their luck .
the press should take a different approach to stimulate positive change in germany , " he added . where are the big spenders ? paraskewopoulos argues that as much as being about a mindset , the current economic and employment situation in germany is the result of a reluctance to spend .
" people have been bullied into feeling insecure about their futures and have thus stopped consuming .
they need to spend rather than sit on their savings and start encouraging domestic growth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for the next generation ?
but even that would not solve the issue of how to encourage the workforce , present or future , to think with innovative flair .
thomas bausch works on a project called " exist , " promoting the notion of entrepreneurialism in universities across the country .
he says that germans have to loosen their grip on their employment ideal of a job for life at a big name business . " people associate a career at places such as siemens or bosch or in the public service with social prestige and do n't even consider the idea of working for themselves , " bausch said . he maintains that the upcoming generation of workers is not only having to grapple with the continued prejudice dating from the 1960s that entrepreneurs are immoral , exploitative capitalists , but are also living with an inherited fear of trying something different .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 nothing ventured , nothing gained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing an innovative approach to job seeking is a slow process as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates . more than five million unemployed - 5.22 million in february , to be exact - is very bad news for germany .
it 's impossible to deny the severity of the problem afflicting the nation 's labor landscape .
there is no quick fix and , many of those affected would say , little prospect for a solution in the medium term .
in short , resignation has set in . when it comes to germans and employment , the national mindset allows them to feel justified in expecting the state to provide them the opportunity to make an honest living .
when it then becomes difficult to access that perceived national right , they often feel insulted and lapse into a kind of sullen lethargy .
klaus boehnke , a professor of social science methodology at the international university in bremen , says germans are intrinsically reluctant to take the bull by the horns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall did n't divide everything " in germany we have two sources for the current inactivity .
there 's the example from the east where the state took care of everything , making it unnecessary for citizens to do anything for themselves , " he said .
" while in the west , the success of the social market economy led people to grow lethargic in the belief that the only way forward is up . " living in a bureaucratic box in essence , people have grown used to living and working inside boxes and unused to thinking too far outside of them , which , in the case of unemployment , presents a very real problem .
the job search can take on many faces , but the german seeker often seems plagued by a lack of imagination and exhibits a tendency to look for work from within the bureaucratic outlook so prevalent in german society . " this behavior dates back to the dominance of the prussian authorities in which people were taught to think and behave according to rules and order , " professor boehnke said .
indeed , instigating change will require a radically sweeping rethink , which will take at least a generation to trickle into effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry of harmonized thinking economic theorist and author of the book " was ist bloss mit den deutschen ? "
-lrb- what 's up with the germans ? -rrb-
spiridon paraskewopoulos says the current attempt at a paradigm shift from a german to a us mentality is the wrong approach . " germans and europeans generally have more faith in their governments than the americans do , and the government should not be trying to change the germans from that which they are , " paraskewopoulos said . he apportions at least part of the blame to the press .
" the media is constantly trumpeting the fact that germany is in crisis and , just as telling a healthy man that he is sick will ultimately lead him to believe it , germans have come to consider themselves down on their luck .
the press should take a different approach to stimulate positive change in germany , " he added . where are the big spenders ? paraskewopoulos argues that as much as being about a mindset , the current economic and employment situation in germany is the result of a reluctance to spend .
" people have been bullied into feeling insecure about their futures and have thus stopped consuming .
they need to spend rather than sit on their savings and start encouraging domestic growth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for the next generation ?
but even that would not solve the issue of how to encourage the workforce , present or future , to think with innovative flair .
thomas bausch works on a project called " exist , " promoting the notion of entrepreneurialism in universities across the country .
he says that germans have to loosen their grip on their employment ideal of a job for life at a big name business . " people associate a career at places such as siemens or bosch or in the public service with social prestige and do n't even consider the idea of working for themselves , " bausch said . he maintains that the upcoming generation of workers is not only having to grapple with the continued prejudice dating from the 1960s that entrepreneurs are immoral , exploitative capitalists , but are also living with an inherited fear of trying something different . " people are terrified of failing , not only because it is hard to get a second chance and a second business loan here in germany , " he said .
" they also do n't want to live with the social stigma of having tried and failed . "

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu intends to end china 's arms embargo the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore .

since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .

" i can not but express my dissatisfaction with this conclusion , " sanader told the european parliament in brussels . he also maintained that his government had fully cooperated with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , which is seeking the arrest of fugitive croatian general ante gotovina . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , however stressed wednesday that he was " fully convinced " that eu entry talks with croatia could begin " in the course of the next weeks . " " i 'm fully convinced that in the course of the next weeks , croatia will be able to prove that she is cooperating closely and entirely with the international tribunal -lrb- un war crimes court -rrb- and that then immediately the decision for the starting of negotiations can be taken , " he said . as expected , eu foreign ministers agreed that the bloc can not start talks as planned on thursday because the ex-yugoslav country has not provided enough help in the hunt for gotovina , according to diplomats . wanted for murder gotovina , a 49-year-old retired general , is considered a war hero by many croatians but is wanted by the un war crimes court for the alleged murder of at least 150 ethnic serbs during the final stages of croatia 's 1991-95 war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passers-by walk in front of a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect gen. ante gotovina , in croatian town of knin .

" " i ca n't be happy -lrb- with the delay -rrb- but it 's a good sign that a negotiating framework was adopted , " he added . not a snub despite the snub the eu 's luxembourg presidency insisted that its " door remains open " to croatia , and sought to play down the significance of the thumbs-down . " in any case the door to the eu will be open , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn as he arrived for the talks .
only a small group of countries - including austria , hungary , slovenia and slovakia - has been in favor of giving zagreb a green light even without gotovina being behind bars . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking before wednesday 's talks started , reiterated that she would vote in favor of negotiations with croatia . " the question is fairness for croatia .
we should take into account the remarkable reform process made and also the remarkable progress in cooperation with icty , " she said . british foreign secretary jack straw lamented that croatia has not cooperated fully with the itcy - but suggested that the eu could set a new target date of july for the talks to start . he noted that del ponte is due to present a report to the un security council in june which could shed light on the situation .

the president of the organisation , peter eigen , said the money which flows into the war-torn country has to be protected .
the report cited the scandal-ridden un oil for food program and highlighted the fact that bribery is endemic in today 's iraq . the chairman of transparency international germany , hans-jörg elshorst , criticised the lack of tender offers for construction contacts , which he said are often administered directly through the us government and simply given to large companies . " it is all very unusual , and that is why we 're so critical , " elshorst told reuters tv . poor construction endangers lives in the report , the international ngo says that bribery affects both industrial and developing nations , resulting in money waste and poor construction quality , which in turn endangers human life .
for the awarding of contracts , the organisation called for greater transparency , fairer competition and the exclusion from bidding of those companies who have either paid or offered a backhander . when it comes to germany , elshorst had praise for the progress made in the battle against corruption .
he said that although the level of corruption has gone down over the past two years , there is still a " large dark figure , " which he estimates to be in the " tens of billions .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.03.2005 a chilly season for ukrainians in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out in the cold : long visa lines at the german embassy in kiev german foreign minister joschka fischer is n't the only one in germany suffering as s result of the tourist-visa scandal .
ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc former dortmund player admits to bribe former borussia dortmund and hertha berlin midfielder steffen karl has admitted he offered ex-energie cottbus goalkeeper georg koch a € 20,000 bribe to fix a german second-division match .
both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "

the president of the organisation , peter eigen , said the money which flows into the war-torn country has to be protected .
the report cited the scandal-ridden un oil for food program and highlighted the fact that bribery is endemic in today 's iraq . the chairman of transparency international germany , hans-jörg elshorst , criticised the lack of tender offers for construction contacts , which he said are often administered directly through the us government and simply given to large companies . " it is all very unusual , and that is why we 're so critical , " elshorst told reuters tv . poor construction endangers lives in the report , the international ngo says that bribery affects both industrial and developing nations , resulting in money waste and poor construction quality , which in turn endangers human life .
for the awarding of contracts , the organisation called for greater transparency , fairer competition and the exclusion from bidding of those companies who have either paid or offered a backhander . when it comes to germany , elshorst had praise for the progress made in the battle against corruption .
he said that although the level of corruption has gone down over the past two years , there is still a " large dark figure , " which he estimates to be in the " tens of billions . " in a table of 30 industrial states , germany has fallen from place 20 to place 15 , but the transparency international chairman said that is not good enough , particularly when compared with a country like britain , which ranks at place eleven . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- eu intends to end china 's arms embargo the european union announced on tuesday that it intends to bring its 16-year arms embargo against china to an end , much to the regret of visiting us president george w. bush .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .

the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .

such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism .

" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .

it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .

the president of the organisation , peter eigen , said the money which flows into the war-torn country has to be protected .
the report cited the scandal-ridden un oil for food program and highlighted the fact that bribery is endemic in today 's iraq . the chairman of transparency international germany , hans-jörg elshorst , criticised the lack of tender offers for construction contacts , which he said are often administered directly through the us government and simply given to large companies . " it is all very unusual , and that is why we 're so critical , " elshorst told reuters tv . poor construction endangers lives in the report , the international ngo says that bribery affects both industrial and developing nations , resulting in money waste and poor construction quality , which in turn endangers human life .
for the awarding of contracts , the organisation called for greater transparency , fairer competition and the exclusion from bidding of those companies who have either paid or offered a backhander . when it comes to germany , elshorst had praise for the progress made in the battle against corruption .
he said that although the level of corruption has gone down over the past two years , there is still a " large dark figure , " which he estimates to be in the " tens of billions . " in a table of 30 industrial states , germany has fallen from place 20 to place 15 , but the transparency international chairman said that is not good enough , particularly when compared with a country like britain , which ranks at place eleven . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 nothing ventured , nothing gained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing an innovative approach to job seeking is a slow process as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates . more than five million unemployed - 5.22 million in february , to be exact - is very bad news for germany .
it 's impossible to deny the severity of the problem afflicting the nation 's labor landscape .
there is no quick fix and , many of those affected would say , little prospect for a solution in the medium term .
in short , resignation has set in . when it comes to germans and employment , the national mindset allows them to feel justified in expecting the state to provide them the opportunity to make an honest living .
when it then becomes difficult to access that perceived national right , they often feel insulted and lapse into a kind of sullen lethargy .
klaus boehnke , a professor of social science methodology at the international university in bremen , says germans are intrinsically reluctant to take the bull by the horns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall did n't divide everything " in germany we have two sources for the current inactivity .
there 's the example from the east where the state took care of everything , making it unnecessary for citizens to do anything for themselves , " he said .
" while in the west , the success of the social market economy led people to grow lethargic in the belief that the only way forward is up . " living in a bureaucratic box in essence , people have grown used to living and working inside boxes and unused to thinking too far outside of them , which , in the case of unemployment , presents a very real problem .
the job search can take on many faces , but the german seeker often seems plagued by a lack of imagination and exhibits a tendency to look for work from within the bureaucratic outlook so prevalent in german society . " this behavior dates back to the dominance of the prussian authorities in which people were taught to think and behave according to rules and order , " professor boehnke said .
indeed , instigating change will require a radically sweeping rethink , which will take at least a generation to trickle into effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry of harmonized thinking economic theorist and author of the book " was ist bloss mit den deutschen ? "
-lrb- what 's up with the germans ? -rrb-
spiridon paraskewopoulos says the current attempt at a paradigm shift from a german to a us mentality is the wrong approach . " germans and europeans generally have more faith in their governments than the americans do , and the government should not be trying to change the germans from that which they are , " paraskewopoulos said . he apportions at least part of the blame to the press .
" the media is constantly trumpeting the fact that germany is in crisis and , just as telling a healthy man that he is sick will ultimately lead him to believe it , germans have come to consider themselves down on their luck .
the press should take a different approach to stimulate positive change in germany , " he added . where are the big spenders ? paraskewopoulos argues that as much as being about a mindset , the current economic and employment situation in germany is the result of a reluctance to spend .
" people have been bullied into feeling insecure about their futures and have thus stopped consuming .
they need to spend rather than sit on their savings and start encouraging domestic growth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for the next generation ?
but even that would not solve the issue of how to encourage the workforce , present or future , to think with innovative flair .
thomas bausch works on a project called " exist , " promoting the notion of entrepreneurialism in universities across the country .
he says that germans have to loosen their grip on their employment ideal of a job for life at a big name business . " people associate a career at places such as siemens or bosch or in the public service with social prestige and do n't even consider the idea of working for themselves , " bausch said . he maintains that the upcoming generation of workers is not only having to grapple with the continued prejudice dating from the 1960s that entrepreneurs are immoral , exploitative capitalists , but are also living with an inherited fear of trying something different . " people are terrified of failing , not only because it is hard to get a second chance and a second business loan here in germany , " he said .
" they also do n't want to live with the social stigma of having tried and failed . "
the adage " nothing ventured , nothing gained " might not have widespread acceptance in germany , but with projects such as exist and government-funded self-starter programs , there are signs that a gentle breeze of change is beginning to blow . tamsin walker , dw-online.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de five million germans jobless germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .
-lrb- march 6 , 2005 -rrb- berlin , warsaw to boost ukrainian democracy germany and poland plan to step up efforts to strengthen ukraine 's fledgling democracy .
but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .
-lrb- march 5 , 2005 -rrb- an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .
-lrb- march 3 , 2005 -rrb- fischer targets opposition in visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday warned that the ongoing heated debate over his role in a damning illegal immigration affair could affect germany 's international standing .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .

koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .

"
schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 nothing ventured , nothing gained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing an innovative approach to job seeking is a slow process as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates . more than five million unemployed - 5.22 million in february , to be exact - is very bad news for germany .
it 's impossible to deny the severity of the problem afflicting the nation 's labor landscape .
there is no quick fix and , many of those affected would say , little prospect for a solution in the medium term .
in short , resignation has set in . when it comes to germans and employment , the national mindset allows them to feel justified in expecting the state to provide them the opportunity to make an honest living .
when it then becomes difficult to access that perceived national right , they often feel insulted and lapse into a kind of sullen lethargy .
klaus boehnke , a professor of social science methodology at the international university in bremen , says germans are intrinsically reluctant to take the bull by the horns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall did n't divide everything " in germany we have two sources for the current inactivity .
there 's the example from the east where the state took care of everything , making it unnecessary for citizens to do anything for themselves , " he said .
" while in the west , the success of the social market economy led people to grow lethargic in the belief that the only way forward is up . " living in a bureaucratic box in essence , people have grown used to living and working inside boxes and unused to thinking too far outside of them , which , in the case of unemployment , presents a very real problem .
the job search can take on many faces , but the german seeker often seems plagued by a lack of imagination and exhibits a tendency to look for work from within the bureaucratic outlook so prevalent in german society . " this behavior dates back to the dominance of the prussian authorities in which people were taught to think and behave according to rules and order , " professor boehnke said .
indeed , instigating change will require a radically sweeping rethink , which will take at least a generation to trickle into effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry of harmonized thinking economic theorist and author of the book " was ist bloss mit den deutschen ? "
-lrb- what 's up with the germans ? -rrb-
spiridon paraskewopoulos says the current attempt at a paradigm shift from a german to a us mentality is the wrong approach . " germans and europeans generally have more faith in their governments than the americans do , and the government should not be trying to change the germans from that which they are , " paraskewopoulos said . he apportions at least part of the blame to the press .
" the media is constantly trumpeting the fact that germany is in crisis and , just as telling a healthy man that he is sick will ultimately lead him to believe it , germans have come to consider themselves down on their luck .
the press should take a different approach to stimulate positive change in germany , " he added . where are the big spenders ? paraskewopoulos argues that as much as being about a mindset , the current economic and employment situation in germany is the result of a reluctance to spend .
" people have been bullied into feeling insecure about their futures and have thus stopped consuming .
they need to spend rather than sit on their savings and start encouraging domestic growth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for the next generation ?
but even that would not solve the issue of how to encourage the workforce , present or future , to think with innovative flair .
thomas bausch works on a project called " exist , " promoting the notion of entrepreneurialism in universities across the country .
he says that germans have to loosen their grip on their employment ideal of a job for life at a big name business . " people associate a career at places such as siemens or bosch or in the public service with social prestige and do n't even consider the idea of working for themselves , " bausch said . he maintains that the upcoming generation of workers is not only having to grapple with the continued prejudice dating from the 1960s that entrepreneurs are immoral , exploitative capitalists , but are also living with an inherited fear of trying something different . " people are terrified of failing , not only because it is hard to get a second chance and a second business loan here in germany , " he said .
" they also do n't want to live with the social stigma of having tried and failed . "
the adage " nothing ventured , nothing gained " might not have widespread acceptance in germany , but with projects such as exist and government-funded self-starter programs , there are signs that a gentle breeze of change is beginning to blow . tamsin walker , dw-online.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de five million germans jobless germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .

" i can not but express my dissatisfaction with this conclusion , " sanader told the european parliament in brussels . he also maintained that his government had fully cooperated with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , which is seeking the arrest of fugitive croatian general ante gotovina . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , however stressed wednesday that he was " fully convinced " that eu entry talks with croatia could begin " in the course of the next weeks . " " i 'm fully convinced that in the course of the next weeks , croatia will be able to prove that she is cooperating closely and entirely with the international tribunal -lrb- un war crimes court -rrb- and that then immediately the decision for the starting of negotiations can be taken , " he said . as expected , eu foreign ministers agreed that the bloc can not start talks as planned on thursday because the ex-yugoslav country has not provided enough help in the hunt for gotovina , according to diplomats . wanted for murder gotovina , a 49-year-old retired general , is considered a war hero by many croatians but is wanted by the un war crimes court for the alleged murder of at least 150 ethnic serbs during the final stages of croatia 's 1991-95 war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passers-by walk in front of a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect gen. ante gotovina , in croatian town of knin .
he is also accused of plundering serbs ' property during the war , when serb rebels opposed croatia 's breakaway from the former yugoslavia . most of the eu 's 25 member states remained opposed to giving a go-ahead until gotovina is physically handed over to the icty in the hague . croatia , hoping to be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu as early as 2007 - slovenia became the first last may - was told in december that it could in theory start talks with brussels on march 17 . but that green light was conditional on providing " full cooperation " with icty chief prosecutor carla del ponte - who reiterated tuesday that this was not the case . sanader however insisted wednesday that " croatia has in the past fully cooperated . " " i ca n't be happy -lrb- with the delay -rrb- but it 's a good sign that a negotiating framework was adopted , " he added . not a snub despite the snub the eu 's luxembourg presidency insisted that its " door remains open " to croatia , and sought to play down the significance of the thumbs-down . " in any case the door to the eu will be open , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn as he arrived for the talks .
only a small group of countries - including austria , hungary , slovenia and slovakia - has been in favor of giving zagreb a green light even without gotovina being behind bars . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking before wednesday 's talks started , reiterated that she would vote in favor of negotiations with croatia . " the question is fairness for croatia .
we should take into account the remarkable reform process made and also the remarkable progress in cooperation with icty , " she said . british foreign secretary jack straw lamented that croatia has not cooperated fully with the itcy - but suggested that the eu could set a new target date of july for the talks to start . he noted that del ponte is due to present a report to the un security council in june which could shed light on the situation .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .

the us wants it , the eu wants it gone .
the fight over the weapons embargo against china has smoldered for weeks .
the fact is that european firms already deliver weapons to china - as do american ones . the eu weapons embargo against china can be summed up in a single sentence : " for the moment , the european parliament thinks it is necessary to take the following measures : break off military cooperation and institute a weapons embargo against china . " with these words , the leaders of the eu countries instituted their policy following the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . which weapons are to be affected and how the embargo should be monitored has never been put in writing .
britain decided that british weapons and parts that are not " deadly effective " can be exported .
today , chinese warplanes lift off with rolls royce engines . france and italy , long after 1989 , also continued to deliver radar systems , rockets and airplanes to china .
they had these contracts before china cracked down on the democracy movement , the argument goes .
italy and spain have delivered helicopter technology which they did n't equate with weapons systems , but which now is used in chinese military helicopters .
a german firm received contracts for 2,000 diesel engines to be used for chinese submarines .
whether the contract was filled is unclear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröde in china : a little too friendly ?
in total , the eu states ' " exemptions " from the weapons embargo were worth about € 413 million -lrb- $ 550 million -rrb- in 2003 .
the biggest exporter was france , followed by britain and italy .
the german contribution is relatively small .
the eu 's official journal calculated that , in 2002 , licenses for weapons exports were worth merely € 210 million .
but before a year had passed , the amount eu countries were selling to china had almost doubled . according to critics of weapons exports , guarantees by leading politicians such as german chancellor gerhard schröder - who says abolishing the embargo does n't necessarily mean an export boom in weapons - ca n't be taken at their word .
european weapons manufacturer eads just concluded an agreement with a chinese partner , avichina , and aims to become active as soon as the legal situation allows it . us sells to china too as measured as a percentage of the total of chinese-european trade volume , valued at around € 115 billion annually , weapons transactions are only a side note .
china currently buys about € 7 billion worth of weapons yearly on the international market to modernize their army , and its on the way to becoming the world 's biggest weapons importer .
american firms also deliver weapons to china even though the us government strictly rejects abolishment of the eu embargo . in fact , from 1989 to 1998 , about $ 350 million worth of weapons were delivered to china , reported the arms control association , an independent organization based in washington , dc , using data collected by the us congress ' accounting office .
and israel sold china technology it had acquired from the us .
so-called " dual-use-wares , " equipment that can be used for both civilian and military purposes , must also be counted , even though they go missing from weapons export statistics .
decision pending thus , the almost 16-year-old eu weapons embargo is full of holes .
it should be strengthened through a stricter code of conduct for member states , says benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner for foreign relations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where it all started : tiananmen square the code has existed since 1998 , and a revised and stronger version is under consideration , something france vehemently opposes .
but eu member states generally , if unenthusiastically , agree that the embargo should be abolished if the code of conduct remains as it is .
that will be decided on in june . meanwhile , the us congress has threatened trade sanctions against the eu .
the americans are afraid that , through their cooperation on the europeans ' new galileo satellite navigation system , china will acquire a previously undreamed of military advantage .
until now , there had only been one satellite navigation system , controlled by the us military . the european parliament has repeatedly spoken out against the abolishment of the weapons embargo against china in the past : as long as there are dismal considerations for human rights and threats against taiwan , this symbolic gesture should not be removed , members have said .
the economic interests of the french , british and german weapons industry must remain in second place . bernd riegert -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , eu on collision course over china two senior members of the united states congress warned the european union this week that the lifting of the 15-year arms embargo on china could result in a halt of us sales in military technology to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.03.2005 a chilly season for ukrainians in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out in the cold : long visa lines at the german embassy in kiev german foreign minister joschka fischer is n't the only one in germany suffering as s result of the tourist-visa scandal .
ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate .

spiridon paraskewopoulos says the current attempt at a paradigm shift from a german to a us mentality is the wrong approach . " germans and europeans generally have more faith in their governments than the americans do , and the government should not be trying to change the germans from that which they are , " paraskewopoulos said . he apportions at least part of the blame to the press .
" the media is constantly trumpeting the fact that germany is in crisis and , just as telling a healthy man that he is sick will ultimately lead him to believe it , germans have come to consider themselves down on their luck .
the press should take a different approach to stimulate positive change in germany , " he added . where are the big spenders ? paraskewopoulos argues that as much as being about a mindset , the current economic and employment situation in germany is the result of a reluctance to spend .

they need to spend rather than sit on their savings and start encouraging domestic growth . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hope for the next generation ?

thomas bausch works on a project called " exist , " promoting the notion of entrepreneurialism in universities across the country .
he says that germans have to loosen their grip on their employment ideal of a job for life at a big name business . " people associate a career at places such as siemens or bosch or in the public service with social prestige and do n't even consider the idea of working for themselves , " bausch said . he maintains that the upcoming generation of workers is not only having to grapple with the continued prejudice dating from the 1960s that entrepreneurs are immoral , exploitative capitalists , but are also living with an inherited fear of trying something different . " people are terrified of failing , not only because it is hard to get a second chance and a second business loan here in germany , " he said .
" they also do n't want to live with the social stigma of having tried and failed . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc former dortmund player admits to bribe former borussia dortmund and hertha berlin midfielder steffen karl has admitted he offered ex-energie cottbus goalkeeper georg koch a € 20,000 bribe to fix a german second-division match .
both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .

ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

the president of the organisation , peter eigen , said the money which flows into the war-torn country has to be protected .
the report cited the scandal-ridden un oil for food program and highlighted the fact that bribery is endemic in today 's iraq . the chairman of transparency international germany , hans-jörg elshorst , criticised the lack of tender offers for construction contacts , which he said are often administered directly through the us government and simply given to large companies . " it is all very unusual , and that is why we 're so critical , " elshorst told reuters tv . poor construction endangers lives in the report , the international ngo says that bribery affects both industrial and developing nations , resulting in money waste and poor construction quality , which in turn endangers human life .
for the awarding of contracts , the organisation called for greater transparency , fairer competition and the exclusion from bidding of those companies who have either paid or offered a backhander . when it comes to germany , elshorst had praise for the progress made in the battle against corruption .
he said that although the level of corruption has gone down over the past two years , there is still a " large dark figure , " which he estimates to be in the " tens of billions . " in a table of 30 industrial states , germany has fallen from place 20 to place 15 , but the transparency international chairman said that is not good enough , particularly when compared with a country like britain , which ranks at place eleven . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 nothing ventured , nothing gained großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing an innovative approach to job seeking is a slow process as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates . more than five million unemployed - 5.22 million in february , to be exact - is very bad news for germany .
it 's impossible to deny the severity of the problem afflicting the nation 's labor landscape .
there is no quick fix and , many of those affected would say , little prospect for a solution in the medium term .
in short , resignation has set in . when it comes to germans and employment , the national mindset allows them to feel justified in expecting the state to provide them the opportunity to make an honest living .
when it then becomes difficult to access that perceived national right , they often feel insulted and lapse into a kind of sullen lethargy .
klaus boehnke , a professor of social science methodology at the international university in bremen , says germans are intrinsically reluctant to take the bull by the horns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin wall did n't divide everything " in germany we have two sources for the current inactivity .
there 's the example from the east where the state took care of everything , making it unnecessary for citizens to do anything for themselves , " he said .
" while in the west , the success of the social market economy led people to grow lethargic in the belief that the only way forward is up . " living in a bureaucratic box in essence , people have grown used to living and working inside boxes and unused to thinking too far outside of them , which , in the case of unemployment , presents a very real problem .
the job search can take on many faces , but the german seeker often seems plagued by a lack of imagination and exhibits a tendency to look for work from within the bureaucratic outlook so prevalent in german society . " this behavior dates back to the dominance of the prussian authorities in which people were taught to think and behave according to rules and order , " professor boehnke said .
indeed , instigating change will require a radically sweeping rethink , which will take at least a generation to trickle into effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a far cry of harmonized thinking economic theorist and author of the book " was ist bloss mit den deutschen ?

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .

to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .

" german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border .

ukrainian students and other foreigners here say life has gotten harder for them , too . it has certainly been a cold late winter in europe .
but since a scandal over the granting of visas in kiev swept through the media earlier this year , ukranians living in germany are more likely to complain about the chill they feel from their neighbors . in 1999 , germany 's foreign ministry under joschka fischer -lrb- photo , below -rrb- eased conditions for citizens of the former soviet bloc to get german visas .
the opposition has said the edict helped " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants from eastern europe enter the country on tourist visas between 2000 and 2003 , a number of them helped by organized criminals .
many are suspected of being drug traffickers or women forced into prostitution in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer accepted responsibility since the affair hit the headlines , however , getting a visa has become more difficult than ever .
now , students who used to spend a few quiet months here studying the language say they are faced with stereotypes that all people from eastern europe are members of the mafia , illegal workers or prostitutes .
commentators have complained that the media has taken a lowbrow tone on the topic , fanning the flames of bigotry . checking up ukrainian viktor onoprienko was in germany in 2001 , where he was studying german at the steinke language institute in bonn .
back then , he got his visa without a problem .
this time , it was a different story . " i was really lucky , " onoprienko said .
" but for many of my friends it is a big problem .
they have to wait a long time for a visa , or they just do n't get one at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visa application most countries issue student visas as a matter of course to people who want to learn a language .
to get one , the applicant usually just has to show a contract with a language school .
since the beginning of the year , german officials have been checking on these students to see if they are showing up for class . contrary to what many people believe , there are rarely students who fail to attend school , said yawen xuan , who works at the steinke institute .
" of 100 students , there is at most one who does n't regularly come to class , where we suspect they did n't really want the visa in order to learn german . " strange reactions oxana krawtschenko came to bonn from odessa because she wants to study german literature .
at first , she said , she felt good living in germany .
" but after a few weeks , i noticed the locals reacted strangely when they learned i come from ukraine .
they sometimes asked me what i am doing here , whether i want to study or work .
people think ukrainians only want to work illegally . " german-russian novelist vladimir kaminer -lrb- " russian disco " -rrb- spoke for many when he complained in a recent interview in der spiegel magazine about the tone the debate has taken on in the german media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " russian disco " author vladimir kaminer " the german media is spreading the impression that ukrainians - who oddly enough they recently celebrated as heroes of democracy - as basically a hoard of thieves , murderers and prostitutes just waiting to cross the border , " kaminer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
such a tone " falls on fertile ground " in some segments of the german population , furthering bigotry and racism . " already under hitler , ' the barbarian hoards from the east ' was a successfully propagated enemy image , " kaminer told der spiegel . meanwhile , he said , the fear that eastern europeans are adding to germany 's high unemployment is only part of the story .
" it 's a popular argument - especially for the people who employ illegal ukrainian workers at starvation wages , or for the guys who visit the ukrainian prostitutes , " he said . germany stands to lose kaminer warned that restricting visas further will only lead to more criminal activity and more human trafficking .
" the great paradox in this debate is this : i read every day that loose visa regulation led to criminality and human trafficking .
but the opposite is true .
the more difficult it is to get a visa , the more lucrative it is for the criminals who help people cross the border . " but even if their lives have gotten harder , kaminer is convinced that it is not the ukrainians who suffer most as a result of the debate . " the real victims here are the germans , " he told der spiegel .
" the damage done by this campaign and the fear of foreigners it has created is more lasting than any foreign minister . ...
you ca n't label every foreigner a thief or a whore . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

but there 's little doubt that kiev 's ties with berlin have been strained by the ongoing illegal immigration scandal in germany .

foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .

on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .

both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.03.2005 -pipe- 15:00 utc former dortmund player admits to bribe former borussia dortmund and hertha berlin midfielder steffen karl has admitted he offered ex-energie cottbus goalkeeper georg koch a € 20,000 bribe to fix a german second-division match .
both koch and disgraced referee robert hoyzer named karl in connection with the match-fixing scandal currently engulfing german football .
the 35-year-old karl , who was arrested last wednesday , has now confessed .
" mr karl has admitted to prosecutors that he offered the former cottbus goalkeeper -lrb- georg -rrb- koch between 15,000 and 20,000 euros to manipulate the match between regensburg and cottbus , " said andreas bartholome , the player 's lawyer .
on the final day of last season 's second division , energie cottbus , who koch was playing for at the time , took on regensburg and the goalkeeper said he received a phone call from karl asking him to " let a few goals in " for a 20,000 euro purse .
koch hung up but claimed karl phoned back with the same offer in a more threatening tone .
when the accusation came to light karl said : " all i can say is i sleep well at night . "
but new evidence has forced the former hertha player to spill the beans and it appears he was involved with the same croatian mafia circle as tainted official hoyzer .
hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches - although he is being investigated for a total of 63 games - and has denounced other parties including referee dominik marks .
marks pleaded his innocence but has since been arrested . dw-world.de german cops raid homes in soccer scandal a mass police raid on the premises of 19 football match-fixing suspects has uncovered more proof of manipulation , the berlin public prosecuter 's office confirmed on wednesday .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .
in her second-to-last novel , " as if i was not there , " she described from the victim 's perspective , how an unnamed woman experienced the horrors of war .
in " they would never hurt a fly , " it 's the perpetrators who again are in the foreground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 , 2000 photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 , 2002 .
" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .
so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .

" i 've written so much about the victims , " said drakulic .
" at a certain point , you logically start wondering , who are these people who did all those things , who gave the orders for these crimes ?
in bosnia , 200,000 people were killed , two million were exiled .
someone has to be responsible for that , someone is guilty .
we 've got the tribunal in the hague - and governments that are not being very cooperative .

unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .

" i can not but express my dissatisfaction with this conclusion , " sanader told the european parliament in brussels . he also maintained that his government had fully cooperated with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , which is seeking the arrest of fugitive croatian general ante gotovina . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , however stressed wednesday that he was " fully convinced " that eu entry talks with croatia could begin " in the course of the next weeks . " " i 'm fully convinced that in the course of the next weeks , croatia will be able to prove that she is cooperating closely and entirely with the international tribunal -lrb- un war crimes court -rrb- and that then immediately the decision for the starting of negotiations can be taken , " he said . as expected , eu foreign ministers agreed that the bloc can not start talks as planned on thursday because the ex-yugoslav country has not provided enough help in the hunt for gotovina , according to diplomats . wanted for murder gotovina , a 49-year-old retired general , is considered a war hero by many croatians but is wanted by the un war crimes court for the alleged murder of at least 150 ethnic serbs during the final stages of croatia 's 1991-95 war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passers-by walk in front of a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect gen. ante gotovina , in croatian town of knin .
he is also accused of plundering serbs ' property during the war , when serb rebels opposed croatia 's breakaway from the former yugoslavia . most of the eu 's 25 member states remained opposed to giving a go-ahead until gotovina is physically handed over to the icty in the hague . croatia , hoping to be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu as early as 2007 - slovenia became the first last may - was told in december that it could in theory start talks with brussels on march 17 . but that green light was conditional on providing " full cooperation " with icty chief prosecutor carla del ponte - who reiterated tuesday that this was not the case . sanader however insisted wednesday that " croatia has in the past fully cooperated . " " i ca n't be happy -lrb- with the delay -rrb- but it 's a good sign that a negotiating framework was adopted , " he added . not a snub despite the snub the eu 's luxembourg presidency insisted that its " door remains open " to croatia , and sought to play down the significance of the thumbs-down . " in any case the door to the eu will be open , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn as he arrived for the talks .
only a small group of countries - including austria , hungary , slovenia and slovakia - has been in favor of giving zagreb a green light even without gotovina being behind bars . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking before wednesday 's talks started , reiterated that she would vote in favor of negotiations with croatia . " the question is fairness for croatia .
we should take into account the remarkable reform process made and also the remarkable progress in cooperation with icty , " she said . british foreign secretary jack straw lamented that croatia has not cooperated fully with the itcy - but suggested that the eu could set a new target date of july for the talks to start . he noted that del ponte is due to present a report to the un security council in june which could shed light on the situation .

born in rijeka in 1949 , drakulic grew up in tito 's yugoslavia .
today she lives in vienna , stockholm , and from time to time , in her home country . four of drakulic 's novels and five of her non-fiction books have been translated into over 20 languages .
at the heart of her writing are 12 years of attempting to understand the horrors of the balkan wars . her latest book , " they would never hurt a fly : war criminals on trial in the hague , " won her this year 's leipzig book prize for european understanding .
the € 10,000 prize honors people whose work increases tolerance in europe , and especially in central and eastern european countries . perpetrator 's perspective drakulic 's book walks a fine line between literature and journalism , said jury member inke brodersen . " it 's a highly political book and at the same time , undoubtedly a literary work , not least because the author succeeds in prompting a reflective process in the reader - something one does n't often find in this form , " brodersen said .
" her description of how neighbors turned into murderers touches the reader .
you ask yourself how you would have acted in the same situation . " drakulic can not forget how it was just recently that one of the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii took place on germany 's doorstep , in supposedly " secure " europe .

she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .

so , there are questions .
i think it was n't any different in germany after world war ii . " drakulic observed proceedings at the war crimes tribunal in the hague for five months .
she followed the appearances of slobodan milosevic and biljana plavsic , as well as other lesser known war criminals . normal people how is it possible that they became what they are ?
that 's the question drakulic asks herself in 13 unsettling stories .
unsettling because , with these stories , drakulic brings the war in the balkans from the periphery back to the center of our consciousness .
unsettling because all these criminals led such completely normal lives before the war : waiters , hairdressers , police officers and taxi drivers were suddenly turned into butchers . " the more i read about what happened and listened to people , the more i realized just how normal they were , " she said .
" what happens next is a unique interaction between a person 's character and their situation . " " the moral of the book is , yes , these people are just ordinary people like us .
which means , should we find ourselves in a similar situation , we could choose to react the same way they did .
in other words , we do n't know what we 're capable of . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic during his trial in the hague .
in the end , these arch-enemies find themselves cooking and playing cards together in the hague 's scheveningen prison .
and they all still address milosevic as " mr. president . " " if this sort of fraternalism among the sworn enemies of yesterday really is the epilogue to the war , then what was the reason that it had to come to all this ?
just looking at the lads now sitting in scheveningen , the answer is clear : no reason .

researchers have dubbed this group " generation good-bye " for their willingness to pack their bags and seek their academic fortunes abroad .
the president of the hamburg institute of international economics , thomas straubhaar , called the high number of potential emigrants " alarming and depressing , " and said it should serve as a warning signal to the older generation .
the poll also found that the values of today 's 20 to 29 year olds have changed since the 1990s .
young university graduates today have a more sober outlook on life , are more pragmatic and have more conservative values than they did a decade ago .
however , where big paychecks and quick career advancement were priorities for young people 10 years ago , the current generation puts more emphasis on job satisfaction , secure employment and a healthy balance between work and private life . dw-world.de dw-world : bringing the brains back home the gain network , an initiative started to help lure german researchers home , is celebrating its first anniversary .

" i can not but express my dissatisfaction with this conclusion , " sanader told the european parliament in brussels . he also maintained that his government had fully cooperated with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , which is seeking the arrest of fugitive croatian general ante gotovina . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , however stressed wednesday that he was " fully convinced " that eu entry talks with croatia could begin " in the course of the next weeks . " " i 'm fully convinced that in the course of the next weeks , croatia will be able to prove that she is cooperating closely and entirely with the international tribunal -lrb- un war crimes court -rrb- and that then immediately the decision for the starting of negotiations can be taken , " he said . as expected , eu foreign ministers agreed that the bloc can not start talks as planned on thursday because the ex-yugoslav country has not provided enough help in the hunt for gotovina , according to diplomats . wanted for murder gotovina , a 49-year-old retired general , is considered a war hero by many croatians but is wanted by the un war crimes court for the alleged murder of at least 150 ethnic serbs during the final stages of croatia 's 1991-95 war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passers-by walk in front of a poster with a portrait of a top war crimes suspect gen. ante gotovina , in croatian town of knin .
he is also accused of plundering serbs ' property during the war , when serb rebels opposed croatia 's breakaway from the former yugoslavia . most of the eu 's 25 member states remained opposed to giving a go-ahead until gotovina is physically handed over to the icty in the hague . croatia , hoping to be the second former yugoslav republic to join the eu as early as 2007 - slovenia became the first last may - was told in december that it could in theory start talks with brussels on march 17 . but that green light was conditional on providing " full cooperation " with icty chief prosecutor carla del ponte - who reiterated tuesday that this was not the case . sanader however insisted wednesday that " croatia has in the past fully cooperated . " " i ca n't be happy -lrb- with the delay -rrb- but it 's a good sign that a negotiating framework was adopted , " he added . not a snub despite the snub the eu 's luxembourg presidency insisted that its " door remains open " to croatia , and sought to play down the significance of the thumbs-down . " in any case the door to the eu will be open , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn as he arrived for the talks .
only a small group of countries - including austria , hungary , slovenia and slovakia - has been in favor of giving zagreb a green light even without gotovina being behind bars . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , speaking before wednesday 's talks started , reiterated that she would vote in favor of negotiations with croatia . " the question is fairness for croatia .
we should take into account the remarkable reform process made and also the remarkable progress in cooperation with icty , " she said . british foreign secretary jack straw lamented that croatia has not cooperated fully with the itcy - but suggested that the eu could set a new target date of july for the talks to start . he noted that del ponte is due to present a report to the un security council in june which could shed light on the situation .

officials are worried the songs could lead to trouble among fans at the ldv vans trophy match against southend united next month if they are played .
in 2003 , anthems were not played when cardiff city met qpr in a promotion play-off in cardiff last year .
wrexham council 's leader said he would be disappointed if a ban was enforced .
a league spokesman said there had been serious disorder when god save the queen was played at an old division three play-off between swansea and northampton at wembley eight years ago .
it led to the decision to ban both god save the queen and hen wlad fy nhadau , wales ' anthem , when cardiff and queen 's park rangers met in the millennium stadium in may 2003 .

" it 's not an international fixture , " he said .

one memo said diana and dodi al fayed switched cars as they left the ritz hotel in paris to divert paparazzi .
but another said it was simply because their first car failed to start .
another memo said the final cost of diana 's funeral was likely to be nearly £ 5m , a figure its writer remarked was " scarcely a deck on the royal yacht " .
the papers , released by the cabinet office under the freedom of information act , contain memos between officials and politicians , including prime minister tony blair , after the event .
a memo to mr blair dated the day of the crash - 31 august , 1997 - said the couple were " immediately subject to media attention " when they arrived at the ritz and were surrounded by journalists when they left .
official memos give differing views of why the couple changed cars " they tried to leave quickly but the first hire car failed to start , " the document , whose author is not revealed , said .
" the second car then left the hotel at speed .
it travelled along a stretch of the river and entered the tunnel in which the car crashed . "
the couple and driver henri paul , who was three times over the alcohol limit , were killed .
another document signed " jay " was sent on the same day to foreign secretary robin cook , who was in singapore .
sir michael jay was the ambassador to france at the time .
it said the pair left the ritz in a different car " because , apparently , their getaway car failed to start , they got into another nearby car driven by a ritz driver " .
but a paper sent by sir michael to the foreign office a few weeks later , on 23 september , says the switch had been " a last minute change of plan aimed at diverting the waiting paparazzi " .
i suspect something around £ 5m will be the final figure - scarcely a deck on the royal yacht anonymous memo in the days following the death , mr blair warned government ministers not to engage in any activities which " could result in political controversy " .
departmental concerns about the cost of diana 's funeral and who would pay began soon after her death .
one anonymous memo said " the treasury have been pretty good so far , but the bill , which stands at around £ 3m , is mounting " .
however , the author adds : " i suspect something around £ 5m will be the final figure - scarcely a deck on the royal yacht . "
this was in reference to the government decision to decommission britannia , which was costing £ 9m a year to run .
however on the same day , hayden philips , permanent secretary at the department of culture , media and sport , said in a separate document that the department had " no financial cover " for the event .
he said it was " extremely difficult " to detail what the eventual cost would be , and that the department had been " exercising all the restraint we can " , but estimated it would be around £ 4m to £ 5m .

one memo said diana and dodi al fayed switched cars as they left the ritz hotel in paris to divert paparazzi .
but another said it was simply because their first car failed to start .
another memo said the final cost of diana 's funeral was likely to be nearly £ 5m , a figure its writer remarked was " scarcely a deck on the royal yacht " .
the papers , released by the cabinet office under the freedom of information act , contain memos between officials and politicians , including prime minister tony blair , after the event .
a memo to mr blair dated the day of the crash - 31 august , 1997 - said the couple were " immediately subject to media attention " when they arrived at the ritz and were surrounded by journalists when they left .
official memos give differing views of why the couple changed cars " they tried to leave quickly but the first hire car failed to start , " the document , whose author is not revealed , said .
" the second car then left the hotel at speed .
it travelled along a stretch of the river and entered the tunnel in which the car crashed . "
the couple and driver henri paul , who was three times over the alcohol limit , were killed .
another document signed " jay " was sent on the same day to foreign secretary robin cook , who was in singapore .
sir michael jay was the ambassador to france at the time .
it said the pair left the ritz in a different car " because , apparently , their getaway car failed to start , they got into another nearby car driven by a ritz driver " .
but a paper sent by sir michael to the foreign office a few weeks later , on 23 september , says the switch had been " a last minute change of plan aimed at diverting the waiting paparazzi " .
i suspect something around £ 5m will be the final figure - scarcely a deck on the royal yacht anonymous memo in the days following the death , mr blair warned government ministers not to engage in any activities which " could result in political controversy " .
departmental concerns about the cost of diana 's funeral and who would pay began soon after her death .
one anonymous memo said " the treasury have been pretty good so far , but the bill , which stands at around £ 3m , is mounting " .
however , the author adds : " i suspect something around £ 5m will be the final figure - scarcely a deck on the royal yacht . "
this was in reference to the government decision to decommission britannia , which was costing £ 9m a year to run .
however on the same day , hayden philips , permanent secretary at the department of culture , media and sport , said in a separate document that the department had " no financial cover " for the event .
he said it was " extremely difficult " to detail what the eventual cost would be , and that the department had been " exercising all the restraint we can " , but estimated it would be around £ 4m to £ 5m .

one memo said diana and dodi al fayed switched cars as they left the ritz hotel in paris to divert paparazzi .
but another said it was simply because their first car failed to start .
another memo said the final cost of diana 's funeral was likely to be nearly £ 5m , a figure its writer remarked was " scarcely a deck on the royal yacht " .
the papers , released by the cabinet office under the freedom of information act , contain memos between officials and politicians , including prime minister tony blair , after the event .
a memo to mr blair dated the day of the crash - 31 august , 1997 - said the couple were " immediately subject to media attention " when they arrived at the ritz and were surrounded by journalists when they left .
official memos give differing views of why the couple changed cars " they tried to leave quickly but the first hire car failed to start , " the document , whose author is not revealed , said .
" the second car then left the hotel at speed .
it travelled along a stretch of the river and entered the tunnel in which the car crashed . "
the couple and driver henri paul , who was three times over the alcohol limit , were killed .
another document signed " jay " was sent on the same day to foreign secretary robin cook , who was in singapore .
sir michael jay was the ambassador to france at the time .
it said the pair left the ritz in a different car " because , apparently , their getaway car failed to start , they got into another nearby car driven by a ritz driver " .
but a paper sent by sir michael to the foreign office a few weeks later , on 23 september , says the switch had been " a last minute change of plan aimed at diverting the waiting paparazzi " .
i suspect something around £ 5m will be the final figure - scarcely a deck on the royal yacht anonymous memo in the days following the death , mr blair warned government ministers not to engage in any activities which " could result in political controversy " .
departmental concerns about the cost of diana 's funeral and who would pay began soon after her death .
one anonymous memo said " the treasury have been pretty good so far , but the bill , which stands at around £ 3m , is mounting " .
however , the author adds : " i suspect something around £ 5m will be the final figure - scarcely a deck on the royal yacht . "
this was in reference to the government decision to decommission britannia , which was costing £ 9m a year to run .
however on the same day , hayden philips , permanent secretary at the department of culture , media and sport , said in a separate document that the department had " no financial cover " for the event .
he said it was " extremely difficult " to detail what the eventual cost would be , and that the department had been " exercising all the restraint we can " , but estimated it would be around £ 4m to £ 5m .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- hitachi unveils ' fastest robot ' bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 16 march , 2005 , 09:01 gmt hitachi unveils ' fastest robot ' japanese electronics firm hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot , called emiew , to challenge honda 's asimo and sony 's qrio robots .
hitachi said the 1.3m -lrb- 4.2ft -rrb- emiew was the world 's quickest-moving robot yet at 6km / h -lrb- 3.7 miles per hour -rrb- .
two wheel-based emiews , pal and chum , introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in japan .
they will be guests at this month 's world expo .
sony and honda have both built robots to showcase engineering .
explaining why hitachi 's emiew used wheels instead of feet , toshihiko horiuchi , from hitachi 's mechanical engineering research laboratory , said : " we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people . "
" we want to make the robots useful for people ...
if the robots moved slower than people , users would be frustrated . "
emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at 6km / h -lrb- 3.7 miles per hour -rrb- on its " wheel feet " , which resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter .
with sensors on the head , waist , and near the wheels , pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands .
" i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya -lsb- shopping districts -rsb- in the future without bumping into people and cars , " pal told reporters .
hitachi said pal and chum , which have a vocabulary of about 100 words , could be " trained " for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years .
big bot battle robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human .
at the recent aaas -lrb- american association for the advancement of science -rrb- annual meeting in washington dc , researchers showed off bipedal designs .
the three designs , each built by a different research group , use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait .
sony and honda have both used humanoid robots , which are not commercially available , as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise .
honda 's asimo was " born " five years ago .
since then , honda and sony 's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events .
asimo has visited the uk , germany , the czech republic , france and ireland as part of a world tour .
sony 's qrio has been singing , jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was , until last year , the fastest robot on two legs .
but its record was beaten by asimo .
it is capable of 3km / h , which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio .
last year , car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot .
by 2007 , it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million " entertainment and leisure " robots in homes , compared to about 137,000 currently , according to the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- .
by the end of that year , 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes , said a report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics .
hitachi is one of the companies already with home cleaning robot machines on the market .

hitachi said the 1.3m -lrb- 4.2ft -rrb- emiew was the world 's quickest-moving robot yet at 6km / h -lrb- 3.7 miles per hour -rrb- .
two wheel-based emiews , pal and chum , introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in japan .
they will be guests at this month 's world expo .
sony and honda have both built robots to showcase engineering .
explaining why hitachi 's emiew used wheels instead of feet , toshihiko horiuchi , from hitachi 's mechanical engineering research laboratory , said : " we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people . "
" we want to make the robots useful for people ...
if the robots moved slower than people , users would be frustrated . "
emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at 6km / h -lrb- 3.7 miles per hour -rrb- on its " wheel feet " , which resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter .
with sensors on the head , waist , and near the wheels , pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands .
" i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya -lsb- shopping districts -rsb- in the future without bumping into people and cars , " pal told reporters .
hitachi said pal and chum , which have a vocabulary of about 100 words , could be " trained " for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years .
big bot battle robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human .
at the recent aaas -lrb- american association for the advancement of science -rrb- annual meeting in washington dc , researchers showed off bipedal designs .
the three designs , each built by a different research group , use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait .
toyota , honda , and sony , all try to out-do each other with robots sony and honda have both used humanoid robots , which are not commercially available , as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise .
honda 's asimo was " born " five years ago .
since then , honda and sony 's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events .
asimo has visited the uk , germany , the czech republic , france and ireland as part of a world tour .
sony 's qrio has been singing , jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was , until last year , the fastest robot on two legs .
but its record was beaten by asimo .
it is capable of 3km / h , which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio .
last year , car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot .

hitachi said the 1.3m -lrb- 4.2ft -rrb- emiew was the world 's quickest-moving robot yet at 6km / h -lrb- 3.7 miles per hour -rrb- .
two wheel-based emiews , pal and chum , introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in japan .
they will be guests at this month 's world expo .
sony and honda have both built robots to showcase engineering .
explaining why hitachi 's emiew used wheels instead of feet , toshihiko horiuchi , from hitachi 's mechanical engineering research laboratory , said : " we aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people . "
" we want to make the robots useful for people ...
if the robots moved slower than people , users would be frustrated . "
emiew - excellent mobility and interactive existence as workmate - can move at 6km / h -lrb- 3.7 miles per hour -rrb- on its " wheel feet " , which resemble the bottom half of a segway scooter .
with sensors on the head , waist , and near the wheels , pal and chum demonstrated how they could react to commands .
" i want to be able to walk about in places like shinjuku and shibuya -lsb- shopping districts -rsb- in the future without bumping into people and cars , " pal told reporters .
hitachi said pal and chum , which have a vocabulary of about 100 words , could be " trained " for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years .
big bot battle robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human .
at the recent aaas -lrb- american association for the advancement of science -rrb- annual meeting in washington dc , researchers showed off bipedal designs .
the three designs , each built by a different research group , use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait .
toyota , honda , and sony , all try to out-do each other with robots sony and honda have both used humanoid robots , which are not commercially available , as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise .
honda 's asimo was " born " five years ago .
since then , honda and sony 's qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events .
asimo has visited the uk , germany , the czech republic , france and ireland as part of a world tour .
sony 's qrio has been singing , jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was , until last year , the fastest robot on two legs .
but its record was beaten by asimo .
it is capable of 3km / h , which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as qrio .
last year , car maker toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot .
by 2007 , it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million " entertainment and leisure " robots in homes , compared to about 137,000 currently , according to the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- .
by the end of that year , 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes , said a report by the un economic commission for europe and the international federation of robotics .
hitachi is one of the companies already with home cleaning robot machines on the market .

china construction bank , the country 's top housing lender , said chairman zhang enzhao had resigned for " personal reasons " but did not elaborate .
the bank is expecting to list its shares in hong kong later this year , in a flotation which could raise up to us $ 10bn -lrb- £ 5.2bn -rrb- .
it did not give reasons for zhang 's exit , but hong kong media said a probe had begun into corruption allegations .
improving image the south china morning post newspaper reported on wednesday that the bank was investigating the disappearance of money from a branch in the northeastern jilin province .
separately , reuters quoted sources close to the situation as saying that zhang had resigned following allegations of kickbacks relating to the procurement of computer equipment .
chinese banks are seeking to clean up their image as they try to raise capital by listing their shares overseas .
in a statement , china construction bank said that it would " move forward with improvement of its governing structure and accelerate reform of its management mechanisms " .
chinese banks have been dogged by persistent corruption scandals in recent years , leading the chinese government to identify banking reform as a key priority .
wang xuebing , former president of china construction bank , was jailed for 12 years for corruption in 2003 for offences committed while he ran the bank of china .
in january , a branch manager at china construction bank was jailed for life for embezzling 111m yuan -lrb- $ 13.4m ; £ 7m -rrb- .

china construction bank and bank of china - also looking to list overseas - shared a $ 45bn state bailout in 2003 to improve their balance sheets ahead of a potential stock market flotation .
chinese regulators called for all big loans to be scrutinised last year to reduce irresponsible lending which has seen banks ' bad debts swell to at least $ 190bn .
however , efforts to bolster internal controls revealed a series of scandals involving embezzlement and loans-for-favours .
