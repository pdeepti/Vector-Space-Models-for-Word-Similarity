there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" this important work extends beyond the atlantic alliance to a 90-nation coalition that includes old friends on every continent , " the us defense secretary said . rumsfeld , who coined the term " the mission defines the coalition " ahead of the us-led war on iraq , made clear saturday that this principle was still very much at the center of new us security thinking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and rumsfeld on saturday " were you to reverse it and say the coalition defines the mission , that would have meant nothing would have happened in liberia , if you 're talking about that nato coalition , or haiti or any number of other activities , " rumsfeld said . eu , us close on iran on one of the most pressing international security issues of the moment , iran 's nuclear program , schröder called on the united states to " actively support " efforts led by germany , britain and france to persuade tehran through diplomatic talks to abandon its nuclear ambitions . rumsfeld responded that " there 's not much daylight " between the approaches on iran of the united states and the three european union countries and said washington had " hope " the european initiative would produce the desired results . nato chief : no need for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer meanwhile said here on saturday the alliance was " alive and kicking " and doubted whether an independent review of the body as suggested by schröder would produce anything new . " i think the result of a high-level panel might well be that the advice would be to re-invent nato , " he said .
" in other words , i think nato is the primary form of transatlantic consultations and it should stay that way . " anyway , de hoop scheffer said , " i would rather see us doing transatlantic relations than discussing them .
nato definitely does not need oxygen . " alliance must prepare for middle east role he also said the alliance must prepare for a possible role in maintaining a future agreement to end the conflict between israel and the palestinians . " we should not shy away from starting to think about a potential role for nato in supporting a middle east peace agreement , " de hoop scheffer said .
" if the call comes to nato , this alliance must be prepared to respond positively and to play its full part . " however before nato troops were deployed , there would have to be a peace agreement and the agreement of both israel and the palestinians , the dutchman said . " we are not yet at a point where an active nato role is on the cards , " he added . struck : germany will fulfil responsibilities germany 's struck told the conference that germany was prepared to contribute troops to any nato force in the middle east . germany " would fulfil its responsibilities to nato , " struck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich hosts security conference the annual international security conference opens in germany on friday with the emphasis on transatlantic unity , hopes for peace in the middle east and the role of the united nations .

stuttgart played poorly and saw their title hopes plummet in hamburg .
hertha berlin and werder bremen , however , have made their championship aspirations known . schalke 04 have pulled back even with bayern munich at the top of the standings with an easy 3-0 victory against wolfsburg .
it did not take long for ralf rangnick 's " royal blues " to make clear who was the superior team .
in the 13th minute , german international striker scored with a header off a free kick taken by lincoln .
lincoln would assist again off a free kick in the 35th minute .
this time ebbe sand was the beneficiary and practically eliminated wolfsburg from any chance of reaching their goal of qualifying for european club competition .
in the second half , mike henke would put on the finishing touches with a goal in the 85th minute .
schalke now stand even with bayern on 41 points , but bayern has a game in hand .
stuttgart fading in second leg matthias sammer 's vfb stuttgart traveled to their northern nemesis hamburg and lost 2-1 .
things looked promising for the southerners when , in the 15th minute , imre szabics found the net .
two minutes later , hamburg tied it when sergej barbarez took a stefan beinlich cross and easily scored .
in the second half , daniel van buyten headed the game-winning goal .
again it was stefan beinlich who assisted .
stuttgart drops to fifth place .
hamburg are hot , in the hunt for a uefa cup spot and lie just one point behind stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder 's " w " is moving towards the top of the standings hamburg 's hanseatic neighbor , defending champions werder bremen , are all of a sudden making a move to the top of the standings .
four weeks ago they lost to schalke and everyone thought thomas schaaf 's side would throw in the towel .
instead they have thrown down the gauntlet and with their 2-0 win over weak mönchengladbach , they lie alone in third place on 37 points .
18-year old aaron hunt and mohamed zidan scored for bremen .
bremen 's nearest challenger are hertha berlin .
a late goal by artur wichniarek gave a 2-1 victory to the team from the capital .

one minute later , nuremberg had a man advantage when berlin 's andreas neuendorf was sent off but failed not only to profit , they lost the game .
dortmund wins in miserable conditions just one month ago , dortmund were fighting to avoid the relegation zone .
now they stand 12 points away from that unusual region .
they drove their ruhr valley rival bochum further down into the depths of the relegation zone after a 1-0 victory .
playing on a pitch more reminiscent of swimming pool , both sides watched the ball stop suddenly in puddles but the game did n't lack chances .
jan koller scored the lone goal , but bochum were the unfortunate victims of an offside call that was n't .
coach peter neururer must now truly be worried about his job .
the remaining two sides far down in the table , freiburg and rostock , are falling further and further away from 15th place which would preserve their place in the top division .
rostock lost 2-1 in kaiserslautern .
a late goal by rostock 's rade prica made the game interesting but minutes later he was sent off for unsportsmanlike conduct .
rostock are now in last place on a meager 13 points .
freiburg played at home but managed only to gain a point with a 0-0 tie against hanover , a result that truly helped neither side .
levan tskitishvili failed to convert a spot kick for volker finke 's side , valuable points they could not afford to give up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. rent-a-painting art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.02.2005 leipzig , the art world 's new mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , one of the leipzig school 's much-hyped students all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .
there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .
he is reported to have banked € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,850 -rrb- for corrupting a bundesliga referee with € 5000 the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . how many referees hoyzer corrupted is uncertain but three officials , felix zwayer , dominik marks and jürgen jansen are under investigation for rigging matches . jansen is a bundesliga referee while zwayer and marks officiate matches outside the top-flight .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .
proliferation is a global concern , and it requires a global effort .

the destruction of the city on feb .
13 , 1945 signifies both horror and a warning , dw 's uta thofern writes . was it the beginning of the end for the nazi regime and well-earned punishment for the german war of aggression or the symbol of a senseless allied bomb campaign against an already conquered civilian population ?
hardly any other world war ii incident has been interpreted in such different ways as the feb .
13 , 1945 , bombing of dresden . the fact is , the attacks did decisively weaken nazi germany both militarily and in terms of morale .
it 's also true that one of the world 's most beautiful cities was destroyed , a city full of refugees ; the death toll remains a point of contention and the extent of the cultural losses enormous . the myth of the " innocent art metropolis " that was unprepared and unfairly destroyed was started by the nazis .
they used the horrible images of charred bodies and smoldering ruins as propaganda to foment resistance against the allies in the last weeks of the war .

it 's also true that one of the world 's most beautiful cities was destroyed , a city full of refugees ; the death toll remains a point of contention and the extent of the cultural losses enormous . the myth of the " innocent art metropolis " that was unprepared and unfairly destroyed was started by the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. rent-a-painting art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.02.2005 leipzig , the art world 's new mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , one of the leipzig school 's much-hyped students all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .
there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .
proliferation is a global concern , and it requires a global effort .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .

" nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .

academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .

" nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" this important work extends beyond the atlantic alliance to a 90-nation coalition that includes old friends on every continent , " the us defense secretary said . rumsfeld , who coined the term " the mission defines the coalition " ahead of the us-led war on iraq , made clear saturday that this principle was still very much at the center of new us security thinking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and rumsfeld on saturday " were you to reverse it and say the coalition defines the mission , that would have meant nothing would have happened in liberia , if you 're talking about that nato coalition , or haiti or any number of other activities , " rumsfeld said . eu , us close on iran on one of the most pressing international security issues of the moment , iran 's nuclear program , schröder called on the united states to " actively support " efforts led by germany , britain and france to persuade tehran through diplomatic talks to abandon its nuclear ambitions . rumsfeld responded that " there 's not much daylight " between the approaches on iran of the united states and the three european union countries and said washington had " hope " the european initiative would produce the desired results . nato chief : no need for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer meanwhile said here on saturday the alliance was " alive and kicking " and doubted whether an independent review of the body as suggested by schröder would produce anything new . " i think the result of a high-level panel might well be that the advice would be to re-invent nato , " he said .
" in other words , i think nato is the primary form of transatlantic consultations and it should stay that way . " anyway , de hoop scheffer said , " i would rather see us doing transatlantic relations than discussing them .
nato definitely does not need oxygen . " alliance must prepare for middle east role he also said the alliance must prepare for a possible role in maintaining a future agreement to end the conflict between israel and the palestinians . " we should not shy away from starting to think about a potential role for nato in supporting a middle east peace agreement , " de hoop scheffer said .
" if the call comes to nato , this alliance must be prepared to respond positively and to play its full part . " however before nato troops were deployed , there would have to be a peace agreement and the agreement of both israel and the palestinians , the dutchman said . " we are not yet at a point where an active nato role is on the cards , " he added . struck : germany will fulfil responsibilities germany 's struck told the conference that germany was prepared to contribute troops to any nato force in the middle east . germany " would fulfil its responsibilities to nato , " struck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich hosts security conference the annual international security conference opens in germany on friday with the emphasis on transatlantic unity , hopes for peace in the middle east and the role of the united nations .

" this important work extends beyond the atlantic alliance to a 90-nation coalition that includes old friends on every continent , " the us defense secretary said . rumsfeld , who coined the term " the mission defines the coalition " ahead of the us-led war on iraq , made clear saturday that this principle was still very much at the center of new us security thinking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and rumsfeld on saturday " were you to reverse it and say the coalition defines the mission , that would have meant nothing would have happened in liberia , if you 're talking about that nato coalition , or haiti or any number of other activities , " rumsfeld said . eu , us close on iran on one of the most pressing international security issues of the moment , iran 's nuclear program , schröder called on the united states to " actively support " efforts led by germany , britain and france to persuade tehran through diplomatic talks to abandon its nuclear ambitions . rumsfeld responded that " there 's not much daylight " between the approaches on iran of the united states and the three european union countries and said washington had " hope " the european initiative would produce the desired results . nato chief : no need for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer meanwhile said here on saturday the alliance was " alive and kicking " and doubted whether an independent review of the body as suggested by schröder would produce anything new . " i think the result of a high-level panel might well be that the advice would be to re-invent nato , " he said .
" in other words , i think nato is the primary form of transatlantic consultations and it should stay that way . " anyway , de hoop scheffer said , " i would rather see us doing transatlantic relations than discussing them .
nato definitely does not need oxygen . " alliance must prepare for middle east role he also said the alliance must prepare for a possible role in maintaining a future agreement to end the conflict between israel and the palestinians . " we should not shy away from starting to think about a potential role for nato in supporting a middle east peace agreement , " de hoop scheffer said .
" if the call comes to nato , this alliance must be prepared to respond positively and to play its full part . " however before nato troops were deployed , there would have to be a peace agreement and the agreement of both israel and the palestinians , the dutchman said . " we are not yet at a point where an active nato role is on the cards , " he added . struck : germany will fulfil responsibilities germany 's struck told the conference that germany was prepared to contribute troops to any nato force in the middle east . germany " would fulfil its responsibilities to nato , " struck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich hosts security conference the annual international security conference opens in germany on friday with the emphasis on transatlantic unity , hopes for peace in the middle east and the role of the united nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. rent-a-painting art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.02.2005 leipzig , the art world 's new mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo rauch , one of the leipzig school 's much-hyped students all of a sudden , a group of artists that passed through leipzig 's academy of visual arts is the toast of the collecting world .
there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .
he is reported to have banked € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,850 -rrb- for corrupting a bundesliga referee with € 5000 the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . how many referees hoyzer corrupted is uncertain but three officials , felix zwayer , dominik marks and jürgen jansen are under investigation for rigging matches . jansen is a bundesliga referee while zwayer and marks officiate matches outside the top-flight . " i protested my innocence at the beginning , " hoyzer said .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

" in other words , i think nato is the primary form of transatlantic consultations and it should stay that way . " anyway , de hoop scheffer said , " i would rather see us doing transatlantic relations than discussing them .
nato definitely does not need oxygen . " alliance must prepare for middle east role he also said the alliance must prepare for a possible role in maintaining a future agreement to end the conflict between israel and the palestinians . " we should not shy away from starting to think about a potential role for nato in supporting a middle east peace agreement , " de hoop scheffer said .
" if the call comes to nato , this alliance must be prepared to respond positively and to play its full part . " however before nato troops were deployed , there would have to be a peace agreement and the agreement of both israel and the palestinians , the dutchman said . " we are not yet at a point where an active nato role is on the cards , " he added . struck : germany will fulfil responsibilities germany 's struck told the conference that germany was prepared to contribute troops to any nato force in the middle east . germany " would fulfil its responsibilities to nato , " struck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich hosts security conference the annual international security conference opens in germany on friday with the emphasis on transatlantic unity , hopes for peace in the middle east and the role of the united nations .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .
he is reported to have banked € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,850 -rrb- for corrupting a bundesliga referee with € 5000 the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . how many referees hoyzer corrupted is uncertain but three officials , felix zwayer , dominik marks and jürgen jansen are under investigation for rigging matches . jansen is a bundesliga referee while zwayer and marks officiate matches outside the top-flight .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

" this important work extends beyond the atlantic alliance to a 90-nation coalition that includes old friends on every continent , " the us defense secretary said . rumsfeld , who coined the term " the mission defines the coalition " ahead of the us-led war on iraq , made clear saturday that this principle was still very much at the center of new us security thinking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and rumsfeld on saturday " were you to reverse it and say the coalition defines the mission , that would have meant nothing would have happened in liberia , if you 're talking about that nato coalition , or haiti or any number of other activities , " rumsfeld said . eu , us close on iran on one of the most pressing international security issues of the moment , iran 's nuclear program , schröder called on the united states to " actively support " efforts led by germany , britain and france to persuade tehran through diplomatic talks to abandon its nuclear ambitions . rumsfeld responded that " there 's not much daylight " between the approaches on iran of the united states and the three european union countries and said washington had " hope " the european initiative would produce the desired results . nato chief : no need for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer meanwhile said here on saturday the alliance was " alive and kicking " and doubted whether an independent review of the body as suggested by schröder would produce anything new . " i think the result of a high-level panel might well be that the advice would be to re-invent nato , " he said .
" in other words , i think nato is the primary form of transatlantic consultations and it should stay that way . " anyway , de hoop scheffer said , " i would rather see us doing transatlantic relations than discussing them .
nato definitely does not need oxygen . " alliance must prepare for middle east role he also said the alliance must prepare for a possible role in maintaining a future agreement to end the conflict between israel and the palestinians . " we should not shy away from starting to think about a potential role for nato in supporting a middle east peace agreement , " de hoop scheffer said .
" if the call comes to nato , this alliance must be prepared to respond positively and to play its full part .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

stuttgart played poorly and saw their title hopes plummet in hamburg .
hertha berlin and werder bremen , however , have made their championship aspirations known . schalke 04 have pulled back even with bayern munich at the top of the standings with an easy 3-0 victory against wolfsburg .
it did not take long for ralf rangnick 's " royal blues " to make clear who was the superior team .
in the 13th minute , german international striker scored with a header off a free kick taken by lincoln .
lincoln would assist again off a free kick in the 35th minute .
this time ebbe sand was the beneficiary and practically eliminated wolfsburg from any chance of reaching their goal of qualifying for european club competition .
in the second half , mike henke would put on the finishing touches with a goal in the 85th minute .
schalke now stand even with bayern on 41 points , but bayern has a game in hand .
stuttgart fading in second leg matthias sammer 's vfb stuttgart traveled to their northern nemesis hamburg and lost 2-1 .
things looked promising for the southerners when , in the 15th minute , imre szabics found the net .
two minutes later , hamburg tied it when sergej barbarez took a stefan beinlich cross and easily scored .
in the second half , daniel van buyten headed the game-winning goal .
again it was stefan beinlich who assisted .
stuttgart drops to fifth place .
hamburg are hot , in the hunt for a uefa cup spot and lie just one point behind stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder 's " w " is moving towards the top of the standings hamburg 's hanseatic neighbor , defending champions werder bremen , are all of a sudden making a move to the top of the standings .
four weeks ago they lost to schalke and everyone thought thomas schaaf 's side would throw in the towel .
instead they have thrown down the gauntlet and with their 2-0 win over weak mönchengladbach , they lie alone in third place on 37 points .
18-year old aaron hunt and mohamed zidan scored for bremen .
bremen 's nearest challenger are hertha berlin .
a late goal by artur wichniarek gave a 2-1 victory to the team from the capital .
bundesliga goalscoring leader marek mintal tied it in the 79th minute .
one minute later , nuremberg had a man advantage when berlin 's andreas neuendorf was sent off but failed not only to profit , they lost the game .
dortmund wins in miserable conditions just one month ago , dortmund were fighting to avoid the relegation zone .
now they stand 12 points away from that unusual region .
they drove their ruhr valley rival bochum further down into the depths of the relegation zone after a 1-0 victory .
playing on a pitch more reminiscent of swimming pool , both sides watched the ball stop suddenly in puddles but the game did n't lack chances .
jan koller scored the lone goal , but bochum were the unfortunate victims of an offside call that was n't .
coach peter neururer must now truly be worried about his job .
the remaining two sides far down in the table , freiburg and rostock , are falling further and further away from 15th place which would preserve their place in the top division .
rostock lost 2-1 in kaiserslautern .
a late goal by rostock 's rade prica made the game interesting but minutes later he was sent off for unsportsmanlike conduct .
rostock are now in last place on a meager 13 points .
freiburg played at home but managed only to gain a point with a 0-0 tie against hanover , a result that truly helped neither side .
levan tskitishvili failed to convert a spot kick for volker finke 's side , valuable points they could not afford to give up .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .
rather they seek to impose the totalitarian rule george orwell described as ' a boot stomping on a human face - forever . ' " it will take the cooperation of many nations to stop the proliferation of dangerous weapons .

" this important work extends beyond the atlantic alliance to a 90-nation coalition that includes old friends on every continent , " the us defense secretary said . rumsfeld , who coined the term " the mission defines the coalition " ahead of the us-led war on iraq , made clear saturday that this principle was still very much at the center of new us security thinking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and rumsfeld on saturday " were you to reverse it and say the coalition defines the mission , that would have meant nothing would have happened in liberia , if you 're talking about that nato coalition , or haiti or any number of other activities , " rumsfeld said . eu , us close on iran on one of the most pressing international security issues of the moment , iran 's nuclear program , schröder called on the united states to " actively support " efforts led by germany , britain and france to persuade tehran through diplomatic talks to abandon its nuclear ambitions . rumsfeld responded that " there 's not much daylight " between the approaches on iran of the united states and the three european union countries and said washington had " hope " the european initiative would produce the desired results . nato chief : no need for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer meanwhile said here on saturday the alliance was " alive and kicking " and doubted whether an independent review of the body as suggested by schröder would produce anything new .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.02.2005 opinion : confronting myth in dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rebuilt frauenkirche -lrb- center -rrb- became a symbol of reconciliation dresden has become a synonym for world war ii aerial warfare .
the destruction of the city on feb .
13 , 1945 signifies both horror and a warning , dw 's uta thofern writes . was it the beginning of the end for the nazi regime and well-earned punishment for the german war of aggression or the symbol of a senseless allied bomb campaign against an already conquered civilian population ?
hardly any other world war ii incident has been interpreted in such different ways as the feb .
13 , 1945 , bombing of dresden . the fact is , the attacks did decisively weaken nazi germany both militarily and in terms of morale .
it 's also true that one of the world 's most beautiful cities was destroyed , a city full of refugees ; the death toll remains a point of contention and the extent of the cultural losses enormous . the myth of the " innocent art metropolis " that was unprepared and unfairly destroyed was started by the nazis .
they used the horrible images of charred bodies and smoldering ruins as propaganda to foment resistance against the allies in the last weeks of the war .
the nazis portrayed the attack on dresden as a singular and unnecessary act of brutal destructiveness . and the myth carried on after the war in communist east germany 's interpretation of the bombing .
in a bizarre falsification of the united states ' role in the air raids , the gdr turned the yearly commemoration of the victims into a propaganda event against " anglo-american imperialism . " at the same time , west germany shamefacedly chose to skip over the civilian population 's suffering and write off dresden - and other destroyed cities - as a self-inflicted consequence of germany 's war . forging reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both approaches - politically monopolizing the topic as well as neglecting and treating as taboo individuals ' suffering - prepare the ground for the extreme right-wing pied pipers who want to use the anniversary for their own aims . in the meantime , dresden has developed its own way to commemorate the events .

it did not take long for ralf rangnick 's " royal blues " to make clear who was the superior team .
in the 13th minute , german international striker scored with a header off a free kick taken by lincoln .
lincoln would assist again off a free kick in the 35th minute .
this time ebbe sand was the beneficiary and practically eliminated wolfsburg from any chance of reaching their goal of qualifying for european club competition .
in the second half , mike henke would put on the finishing touches with a goal in the 85th minute .
schalke now stand even with bayern on 41 points , but bayern has a game in hand .
stuttgart fading in second leg matthias sammer 's vfb stuttgart traveled to their northern nemesis hamburg and lost 2-1 .
things looked promising for the southerners when , in the 15th minute , imre szabics found the net .
two minutes later , hamburg tied it when sergej barbarez took a stefan beinlich cross and easily scored .
in the second half , daniel van buyten headed the game-winning goal .
again it was stefan beinlich who assisted .
stuttgart drops to fifth place .

now they stand 12 points away from that unusual region .
they drove their ruhr valley rival bochum further down into the depths of the relegation zone after a 1-0 victory .
playing on a pitch more reminiscent of swimming pool , both sides watched the ball stop suddenly in puddles but the game did n't lack chances .
jan koller scored the lone goal , but bochum were the unfortunate victims of an offside call that was n't .
coach peter neururer must now truly be worried about his job .
the remaining two sides far down in the table , freiburg and rostock , are falling further and further away from 15th place which would preserve their place in the top division .
rostock lost 2-1 in kaiserslautern .
a late goal by rostock 's rade prica made the game interesting but minutes later he was sent off for unsportsmanlike conduct .
rostock are now in last place on a meager 13 points .
freiburg played at home but managed only to gain a point with a 0-0 tie against hanover , a result that truly helped neither side .
levan tskitishvili failed to convert a spot kick for volker finke 's side , valuable points they could not afford to give up .

the destruction of the city on feb .
13 , 1945 signifies both horror and a warning , dw 's uta thofern writes . was it the beginning of the end for the nazi regime and well-earned punishment for the german war of aggression or the symbol of a senseless allied bomb campaign against an already conquered civilian population ?
hardly any other world war ii incident has been interpreted in such different ways as the feb .
13 , 1945 , bombing of dresden . the fact is , the attacks did decisively weaken nazi germany both militarily and in terms of morale .
it 's also true that one of the world 's most beautiful cities was destroyed , a city full of refugees ; the death toll remains a point of contention and the extent of the cultural losses enormous . the myth of the " innocent art metropolis " that was unprepared and unfairly destroyed was started by the nazis .
they used the horrible images of charred bodies and smoldering ruins as propaganda to foment resistance against the allies in the last weeks of the war .
the nazis portrayed the attack on dresden as a singular and unnecessary act of brutal destructiveness . and the myth carried on after the war in communist east germany 's interpretation of the bombing .
in a bizarre falsification of the united states ' role in the air raids , the gdr turned the yearly commemoration of the victims into a propaganda event against " anglo-american imperialism . " at the same time , west germany shamefacedly chose to skip over the civilian population 's suffering and write off dresden - and other destroyed cities - as a self-inflicted consequence of germany 's war . forging reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both approaches - politically monopolizing the topic as well as neglecting and treating as taboo individuals ' suffering - prepare the ground for the extreme right-wing pied pipers who want to use the anniversary for their own aims . in the meantime , dresden has developed its own way to commemorate the events .
in the early 1980s , a handful of brave dresdeners used the anniversary of the bombings as an occasion to mount peace movement demonstrations .
what started as a ginger protest against the arms race between east and west eventually led to the end of the gdr . and the dresdeners also emancipated themselves in another way , taking possession of their own past without irrespective of political correctness .
regardless of misgivings , they started rebuilding the frauenkirche , whose ruins had been preserved as a memorial .
constructed with active help from britain , among others , the town landmark stands tall again , as a symbol that reconciliation between peoples must be forged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue " golden rider , " a famous dresden landmark flanks the frauenkirche on the frauenkirche site , dresden will commemorate the victims of the firestorm on feb .
13 , while protesting against neo-nazis and their attempts to monopolize remembrance . peace and freedom are not a condition but a process that can only be successful if dialogue continues with democracy 's opponents - including an honest analysis of one 's own history .
slowly , carefully germany is developing such a new approach to the burdens of history .
nowhere is that as apparent as in dresden . uta thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

the destruction of the city on feb .
13 , 1945 signifies both horror and a warning , dw 's uta thofern writes . was it the beginning of the end for the nazi regime and well-earned punishment for the german war of aggression or the symbol of a senseless allied bomb campaign against an already conquered civilian population ?
hardly any other world war ii incident has been interpreted in such different ways as the feb .
13 , 1945 , bombing of dresden . the fact is , the attacks did decisively weaken nazi germany both militarily and in terms of morale .
it 's also true that one of the world 's most beautiful cities was destroyed , a city full of refugees ; the death toll remains a point of contention and the extent of the cultural losses enormous . the myth of the " innocent art metropolis " that was unprepared and unfairly destroyed was started by the nazis .
they used the horrible images of charred bodies and smoldering ruins as propaganda to foment resistance against the allies in the last weeks of the war .
the nazis portrayed the attack on dresden as a singular and unnecessary act of brutal destructiveness . and the myth carried on after the war in communist east germany 's interpretation of the bombing .
in a bizarre falsification of the united states ' role in the air raids , the gdr turned the yearly commemoration of the victims into a propaganda event against " anglo-american imperialism . " at the same time , west germany shamefacedly chose to skip over the civilian population 's suffering and write off dresden - and other destroyed cities - as a self-inflicted consequence of germany 's war . forging reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both approaches - politically monopolizing the topic as well as neglecting and treating as taboo individuals ' suffering - prepare the ground for the extreme right-wing pied pipers who want to use the anniversary for their own aims . in the meantime , dresden has developed its own way to commemorate the events .
in the early 1980s , a handful of brave dresdeners used the anniversary of the bombings as an occasion to mount peace movement demonstrations .
what started as a ginger protest against the arms race between east and west eventually led to the end of the gdr . and the dresdeners also emancipated themselves in another way , taking possession of their own past without irrespective of political correctness .
regardless of misgivings , they started rebuilding the frauenkirche , whose ruins had been preserved as a memorial .
constructed with active help from britain , among others , the town landmark stands tall again , as a symbol that reconciliation between peoples must be forged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue " golden rider , " a famous dresden landmark flanks the frauenkirche on the frauenkirche site , dresden will commemorate the victims of the firestorm on feb .
13 , while protesting against neo-nazis and their attempts to monopolize remembrance . peace and freedom are not a condition but a process that can only be successful if dialogue continues with democracy 's opponents - including an honest analysis of one 's own history .
slowly , carefully germany is developing such a new approach to the burdens of history .
nowhere is that as apparent as in dresden . uta thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

" however , it is no longer the primary venue where transatlantic partners discuss and coordinate strategies , " schröder , who did not attend the conference due to illness , said in a speech read by his defense minister peter struck to top-level defense and security experts from around the world . the german leader said there had been " strains , mistrust and even tensions " between the united states and the european union in recent years and while a us troop presence in europe was still of " political significance , " it was no longer the security priority that it was during the cold war . schröder calls for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland on jan .
28 the security dialogue between the united states and the european union " in its current form does justice neither to the union 's growing importance nor to the new demands on transatlantic cooperation , " schröder said , but " no one can produce ready answers " on how to change it . the german leader called for creation by the governments of the european union and the united states of a high-ranking panel of independent figures to propose ways of revitalizing their security ties and adapting them to post-cold war challenges . rumsfeld : " most impressive alliance " rumsfeld was more enthusiastic in his endorsement of nato as an historic security institution with valuable past achievements and numerous prospects for future development , but also said that as a large , slow-moving institution it was sometimes of limited use in facing fast-moving threats . " nato is the most impressive military alliance in the history of mankind , but it is what it is , " rumsfeld said .
" there are some times when things have to happen fairly rapidly . " bildunterschrift : donald rumsfeld at the conference in munich the nato alliance , rumsfeld said , " has navigated through some choppy seas over the years " and had always found a way to reconcile even sharp differences .
that should happen again in order to maximize cooperation in fighting new threats such as islamic extremism and weapons proliferation . " today , we share a common enemy , " rumsfeld said .
" radical islamists do not seek an armistice with the civilized world .
they will not negotiate a separate peace .

" this important work extends beyond the atlantic alliance to a 90-nation coalition that includes old friends on every continent , " the us defense secretary said . rumsfeld , who coined the term " the mission defines the coalition " ahead of the us-led war on iraq , made clear saturday that this principle was still very much at the center of new us security thinking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and rumsfeld on saturday " were you to reverse it and say the coalition defines the mission , that would have meant nothing would have happened in liberia , if you 're talking about that nato coalition , or haiti or any number of other activities , " rumsfeld said . eu , us close on iran on one of the most pressing international security issues of the moment , iran 's nuclear program , schröder called on the united states to " actively support " efforts led by germany , britain and france to persuade tehran through diplomatic talks to abandon its nuclear ambitions . rumsfeld responded that " there 's not much daylight " between the approaches on iran of the united states and the three european union countries and said washington had " hope " the european initiative would produce the desired results . nato chief : no need for review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer meanwhile said here on saturday the alliance was " alive and kicking " and doubted whether an independent review of the body as suggested by schröder would produce anything new . " i think the result of a high-level panel might well be that the advice would be to re-invent nato , " he said .
" in other words , i think nato is the primary form of transatlantic consultations and it should stay that way . " anyway , de hoop scheffer said , " i would rather see us doing transatlantic relations than discussing them .
nato definitely does not need oxygen . " alliance must prepare for middle east role he also said the alliance must prepare for a possible role in maintaining a future agreement to end the conflict between israel and the palestinians . " we should not shy away from starting to think about a potential role for nato in supporting a middle east peace agreement , " de hoop scheffer said .
" if the call comes to nato , this alliance must be prepared to respond positively and to play its full part . " however before nato troops were deployed , there would have to be a peace agreement and the agreement of both israel and the palestinians , the dutchman said . " we are not yet at a point where an active nato role is on the cards , " he added . struck : germany will fulfil responsibilities germany 's struck told the conference that germany was prepared to contribute troops to any nato force in the middle east . germany " would fulfil its responsibilities to nato , " struck said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de munich hosts security conference the annual international security conference opens in germany on friday with the emphasis on transatlantic unity , hopes for peace in the middle east and the role of the united nations .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .
he is reported to have banked € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,850 -rrb- for corrupting a bundesliga referee with € 5000 the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . how many referees hoyzer corrupted is uncertain but three officials , felix zwayer , dominik marks and jürgen jansen are under investigation for rigging matches . jansen is a bundesliga referee while zwayer and marks officiate matches outside the top-flight . " i protested my innocence at the beginning , " hoyzer said .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig . " of course , scharpff has already bought up several of the leipzig school 's pieces . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .

" i am afraid of jail as i know the croats are dangerous , " he told bild tabloid .
" i have thought of committing suicide . " hoyzer was paid a " finder 's fee " by a croatian mafia circle in berlin , according to focus magazine .
he is reported to have banked € 10,000 -lrb- $ 12,850 -rrb- for corrupting a bundesliga referee with € 5000 the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . how many referees hoyzer corrupted is uncertain but three officials , felix zwayer , dominik marks and jürgen jansen are under investigation for rigging matches . jansen is a bundesliga referee while zwayer and marks officiate matches outside the top-flight .

the destruction of the city on feb .
13 , 1945 signifies both horror and a warning , dw 's uta thofern writes . was it the beginning of the end for the nazi regime and well-earned punishment for the german war of aggression or the symbol of a senseless allied bomb campaign against an already conquered civilian population ?
hardly any other world war ii incident has been interpreted in such different ways as the feb .
13 , 1945 , bombing of dresden . the fact is , the attacks did decisively weaken nazi germany both militarily and in terms of morale .
it 's also true that one of the world 's most beautiful cities was destroyed , a city full of refugees ; the death toll remains a point of contention and the extent of the cultural losses enormous . the myth of the " innocent art metropolis " that was unprepared and unfairly destroyed was started by the nazis .
they used the horrible images of charred bodies and smoldering ruins as propaganda to foment resistance against the allies in the last weeks of the war .
the nazis portrayed the attack on dresden as a singular and unnecessary act of brutal destructiveness . and the myth carried on after the war in communist east germany 's interpretation of the bombing .
in a bizarre falsification of the united states ' role in the air raids , the gdr turned the yearly commemoration of the victims into a propaganda event against " anglo-american imperialism . " at the same time , west germany shamefacedly chose to skip over the civilian population 's suffering and write off dresden - and other destroyed cities - as a self-inflicted consequence of germany 's war . forging reconciliation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both approaches - politically monopolizing the topic as well as neglecting and treating as taboo individuals ' suffering - prepare the ground for the extreme right-wing pied pipers who want to use the anniversary for their own aims . in the meantime , dresden has developed its own way to commemorate the events .
in the early 1980s , a handful of brave dresdeners used the anniversary of the bombings as an occasion to mount peace movement demonstrations .
what started as a ginger protest against the arms race between east and west eventually led to the end of the gdr . and the dresdeners also emancipated themselves in another way , taking possession of their own past without irrespective of political correctness .
regardless of misgivings , they started rebuilding the frauenkirche , whose ruins had been preserved as a memorial .
constructed with active help from britain , among others , the town landmark stands tall again , as a symbol that reconciliation between peoples must be forged . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statue " golden rider , " a famous dresden landmark flanks the frauenkirche on the frauenkirche site , dresden will commemorate the victims of the firestorm on feb .
13 , while protesting against neo-nazis and their attempts to monopolize remembrance . peace and freedom are not a condition but a process that can only be successful if dialogue continues with democracy 's opponents - including an honest analysis of one 's own history .
slowly , carefully germany is developing such a new approach to the burdens of history .
nowhere is that as apparent as in dresden . uta thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

there are unofficial waiting lists for paintings that have n't been painted yet . a few years ago , when painting was still considered somewhat anachronistic and passé , professor arno rink continued to teach his students brush techniques and graining , glazing and lifting . if people might have snickered back then , they 've come around completely in recent months .
the very students rink has been teaching are now the toast of the international art scene .
the " new leipzig school " is being touted in important trade publications like the art newspaper -lrb- " the future is german " -rrb- and the new york times -lrb- " art stars of the decade " -rrb- as the must-have in every collector 's den . the upcoming open house -lrb- feb 11-12 -rrb- at the academy of visual arts in leipzig , where rink teaches , is a must on this year on every gallerist 's calendar . " we are definitely going there , " said elke hannemann , a director at the berlin gallery eigen + art , which also has a gallery in leipzig .
" with the really big focus on leipzig at the moment a lot of people will of course come to look around . " sold out in 18 minutes the buzz is centering on a group of artists , all around the age of 30 , who at various points in recent years have gone through the leipzig academy .
neo rauch , tim eitel , martin eder and david schnell are winning monumental praise for their paintings , both landscapes and abstracts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " thoughts upon leaving my head " by martin eder .
his works sold out in 18 minutes at art basel last fall at the art basel trade fair in miami beach last fall , all five of eder 's pieces sold for € 36,000 each - 18 minutes after the fair opened .
rauch was awarded the european art award " vincent 2002 " last year .
the prize money of € 50,000 is the highest awarded to contemporary european artists . there 's even an unofficial waiting list for works by the four talents that have n't even been produced yet . painting 's renaissance the academy , as well , is getting its fair share of the spotlight .
this year there were 988 people who applied at the school , for 80 spots .
academy spokesman marion sprenger said she expected a " few thousand guests " at the open house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : academy of visual arts , leipzig where does all the new love for painting come from ? " at one point museum visitors simply get tired watching 20 minute -lrb- art -rrb- videos , and feeling like lugs if they leave before they 're over , " said gerd harry lybke , eigen + art 's owner . if a piece by one of the protégés does get sold , it usually gets passed on to a museum to hang initially .
as a result , the museum for modern art in leipzig currently has an entire room filled with rauch 's work . cool words from a pro with all the excitement , it 's easy to go overboard , which is why renowned collector rudolph udo scharpff is urging caution .
in his 40 years of collecting , he 's seen more than a few trends come and , inevitably , go again . " the artists are still so young .
you have to still wait and see what will come in the future , " said scharpff , who is 75 .
" if an artist is good , he 'll be even better in five years . " he estimates that the hype will last another two years before it cools again and young professionals wanting something " for their loft " will look elsewhere . " you should n't look at it from a money perspective , " said scharpff .
" instead , we should be happy that we have such a generation of painters in berlin and leipzig .

here are a selection of quotes from fellow playwrights , publishers and actors .
the greatest playwright of the 20th century .
the news of his death moved me a lot because i was his friend since the 1960s .
vaclav havel , czech playwright and politician writing meant , for him , an effort to locate in the human species a counterforce to the randomness of victimisation .
salman rushdie , president of international writers ' association pen -lsb- miller -rsb- has looked with compassion into the hearts of some ordinary americans and quietly transferred their hope and anguish to the theatre .
brooks atkinson , new york times critic his work teaches us a lot about how to fight evil .
edward albee , us playwright arthur miller continued to examine american values and moral decay with extraordinary structure and riveting dialogue - right to his last months .
kevin spacey , us actor it 's so rare that you get to work with a legend and he turns out to be as wonderful to work with as his plays are to read .
he was incredible .
he liked young directors to take a crack at his great plays .
todd haimes , artistic director of new york 's roundabout theatre i admired him tremendously for his independence and his clarity of mind .
he was a wonderful chap and i 'm really quite knocked over by this news .
he was so honest and a man of rare integrity in his writing .
you could see it in his writing .
he was also totally independent .
harold pinter , british playwright arthur was the last of the three great theatrical voices of the american century - -lsb- eugene -rsb- o 'neill , -lsb- tennessee -rsb- williams , miller .
arthur 's special achievement was to make political and social plays which belonged on broadway and yet were also powered to reach out into america and way beyond .
david hare , british playwright i always felt it was a deep tragedy that he never won the nobel prize .
his plays were so universal and affected a world generation .
robert weil , executive editor of publisher ww norton he stretched himself out and lived his life as completely as anybody out there i 've ever heard of .
he 's been part of the cultural universe of this country since the war , and that 's 60 years .
it 's most of our lives .
it 's a kind of shattering awareness that he 's not going to be there , but his work will be there , thank god .
brian dennehy , us actor he was a big man and a deeply american man who was lucky enough to have extraordinary women in his life .
he was busy working on plays right until he got sick .
he had such a great life that you do n't feel sad for arthur .
australian-born broadway actress zoe caldwell there was quite a pack to break out of .
he was a contemporary of tennessee williams , who was also writing at this time .
he quickly leapt into this pantheon of great american writers .
there is no question that arthur miller 's effect on american drama and drama worldwide is something we 're going to be recognising for centuries to come ...
he was simultaneously a playwright of enormous humanity and enormous politics .
howard sherman , director of the american theatre wing his loss is a little like the manhattan skyline .
i 'm at a loss for words .
david richenthal , miller 's producer arthur miller was the last of the great titans of the american stage .
he brought to the english-speaking theatre a poetic urgency and tragic sweep that had been absent since the elizabethan era .
i have no doubt that plays like death of a salesman , the crucible and a view from the bridge will always stand with the masterpieces of ibsen , shakespeare and sophocles .

kevin spacey , us actor it 's so rare that you get to work with a legend and he turns out to be as wonderful to work with as his plays are to read .
he was incredible .
he liked young directors to take a crack at his great plays .
todd haimes , artistic director of new york 's roundabout theatre i admired him tremendously for his independence and his clarity of mind .
he was a wonderful chap and i 'm really quite knocked over by this news .
he was so honest and a man of rare integrity in his writing .
you could see it in his writing .
he was also totally independent .
harold pinter , british playwright arthur was the last of the three great theatrical voices of the american century - -lsb- eugene -rsb- o 'neill , -lsb- tennessee -rsb- williams , miller .
arthur 's special achievement was to make political and social plays which belonged on broadway and yet were also powered to reach out into america and way beyond .
david hare , british playwright i always felt it was a deep tragedy that he never won the nobel prize .
his plays were so universal and affected a world generation .
robert weil , executive editor of publisher ww norton he stretched himself out and lived his life as completely as anybody out there i 've ever heard of .
he 's been part of the cultural universe of this country since the war , and that 's 60 years .
it 's most of our lives .
it 's a kind of shattering awareness that he 's not going to be there , but his work will be there , thank god .
brian dennehy , us actor he was a big man and a deeply american man who was lucky enough to have extraordinary women in his life .
he was busy working on plays right until he got sick .
he had such a great life that you do n't feel sad for arthur .
australian-born broadway actress zoe caldwell there was quite a pack to break out of .
he was a contemporary of tennessee williams , who was also writing at this time .
he quickly leapt into this pantheon of great american writers .
there is no question that arthur miller 's effect on american drama and drama worldwide is something we 're going to be recognising for centuries to come ...
he was simultaneously a playwright of enormous humanity and enormous politics .
howard sherman , director of the american theatre wing his loss is a little like the manhattan skyline .
i 'm at a loss for words .
david richenthal , miller 's producer arthur miller was the last of the great titans of the american stage .
he brought to the english-speaking theatre a poetic urgency and tragic sweep that had been absent since the elizabethan era .
i have no doubt that plays like death of a salesman , the crucible and a view from the bridge will always stand with the masterpieces of ibsen , shakespeare and sophocles .

supporters of the plans will congregate at the east yorkshire resort 's harbour , the site of the proposed development .
the protest was hastily organised after the harbour commissioners withdrew their support for the plan last week .
organiser martyn coltman said : " we urge the commissioners to come back to the table and iron out the problems . "
residents ' backing mr coltman , a member of the town 's regeneration partnership , said about 90 % of residents questioned so far were in favour of a new 500-berth marina and new fishing facilities .
however , the commissioners , who run the town 's harbour , say they prefer their own scaled-back plans for a 100-berth redevelopment .
" but the harbour is not theirs , they are just looking after it on behalf of the town , " said mr coltman .
" a very few people are holding up a large investment and i would say stop playing politics with this because it is too important .

the hall for cornwall in truro , which opened its doors seven years ago , is in desperate need of immediate renovation which will cost up to £ 255,000 .
another £ 100,000 a year is needed each year to maintain the building .
the work needed includes roof repairs , damp in the grand staircase , worn seating and lighting equipment .
we are facing an uphill task tim brinkman , hall for cornwall an extra 50p is being added to ticket prices to help build up running funds .
this will come into force on 1 april , but a £ 1 credit card charge will be abolished .
the hall for cornwall is also applying for grants and approaching various trusts and foundations for funding .
about £ 25,000 of the £ 100,000 needed to refurbish the seating has already been raised .
tim brinkman , the theatre 's director , says in many ways the hall for cornwall is a victim of its own success .

there were calls for action after elgan williams , 16 , from denbighshire , was fatally injured outside the showground .
he died the next day .
at an inquest on thursday , his father made a plea for improvements .
the welsh assembly government has agreed a temporary 30mph limit will be imposed and warning signs erected .
elgan , from groes , had been due to compete in a sheep-shearing competition at the show , held at llanelwedd .
he was crossing the a470 between the showground and the nearby campsite when the accident happened on the eve of the start of the show in july .
he received head injuries in a collision with a vauxhall astra estate .
powys coroner geraint williams recorded a verdict of accidental death .
more than 200,000 people converged on the ground in 2004 elgan 's father , bob williams , asked for the route used by young farmers camping overnight for the show to be lit at night .
the coroner said he would ask for immediate action from the showground committee .
on friday , the assembly government said it would install a sign for the duration of this year 's show to warn drivers of pedestrian hazards , and a temporary 30mph speed limit .
police have asked the safety camera partnership to enforce the speed limit during the show .
the assembly government said that as relatively low numbers of pedestrians crossed the road at other times of the year , permanent street lighting would not be installed .
it did agree , however , that the royal welsh agricultural society or the young farmers ' clubs in wales would be allowed to put in temporary lighting for the duration of the show .
following last year 's tragedy , show organisers called on assembly officials and powys county council to review road safety .
the council installed temporary lighting as an emergency measure at the location .
