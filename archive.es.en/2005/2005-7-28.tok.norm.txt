it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
" having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .

the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .
the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .

caroline had initially demanded 190,000 euros for legal costs and damages . dw-world.de press freedom under siege , media bosses say fearing a serious threat to press freedom , leading german newspapers and broadcasters have urged chancellor schröder to contest a european court ruling curtailing media reporting on the private lives of celebrities .

around 68,000 people were added to the jobless figures in july , bringing the total up to 4.77 million , the federal labor agency calculated .
the rate in june had been 11.3 percent .
however , the seasonally adjusted figures - which give a better indication of the real employment picture - showed a drop of 42,000 in the jobless figure , which was better than expected by analysts but still left unemployment close to the five-million mark reached this year for the first time since world war ii .
analysts remained pessimistic , saying many of the jobs were so-called one-euro jobs provided by local authorities and non-profit organizations which the unemployed can be obliged to take or risk losing their benefits according to the latest labor market reform . dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

" people have been asking me for 15 years now when i 'm going to quit , " the traumatologist said after his historic win .
" maybe another 20 years ? " " when i do quit this will be the medal that i 'll be most proud of , " he added . warnecke 's record has helped put a smile back on the faces of those at the helm of the german swimming federation -lrb- dsv -rrb- .

the appeal court in cologne ruled that neither international law nor german law allowed for such a claim , upholding a decision made by a court in bonn in december last year .
the german state can not be accused of " behaving like a war criminal " as a result of the aerial bombing of the bridge in the central serbian town which killed 10 people and injured 17 , the judges ruled .
the serbs , all relatives or friends of the victims , were claiming 536,000 euros -lrb- $ 650,000 -rrb- in damages in a civil case which was the first of its kind in germany .
the claimants said that although no german military personnel were in the planes which bombed the bridge , germany was part of the nato operation and took part in the decision to carry out the bombing .
the serbs said after the ruling that they would now take their case to the federal court of justice .
in claims backed up by amnesty international , the serbs said the nato air strikes on may 30 , 1999 , on the town 160 kilometres -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- south of belgrade violated international law because they targeted civilians . dw-world.de can serbia face the past ?
monday marks the 10th anniversary of the srebrenica massacre , when serbian forces killed about 8,000 muslims during the bosnian war .

the appeal court in cologne ruled that neither international law nor german law allowed for such a claim , upholding a decision made by a court in bonn in december last year .
the german state can not be accused of " behaving like a war criminal " as a result of the aerial bombing of the bridge in the central serbian town which killed 10 people and injured 17 , the judges ruled .
the serbs , all relatives or friends of the victims , were claiming 536,000 euros -lrb- $ 650,000 -rrb- in damages in a civil case which was the first of its kind in germany .
the claimants said that although no german military personnel were in the planes which bombed the bridge , germany was part of the nato operation and took part in the decision to carry out the bombing .
the serbs said after the ruling that they would now take their case to the federal court of justice .
in claims backed up by amnesty international , the serbs said the nato air strikes on may 30 , 1999 , on the town 160 kilometres -lrb- 100 miles -rrb- south of belgrade violated international law because they targeted civilians . dw-world.de can serbia face the past ?

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday .

" we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
" having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
" having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .

migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .

but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .

steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .

" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
" having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.07.2005 puma battling to tear stripe off adidas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma are pulling out all the stops to keep up with main rival adidas all 's fair in love , war ... and the sportswear market , apparently .
while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .
the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .
the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations .
-lrb- july 31 , 2004 -rrb- klinsi : no adidas boots , no world cup “ wear adidas boots or stay at home . ”

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .

" a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 germany rejects blackmail allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german foreign ministry , led by fischer , has denied any foul play stung by allegations of using underhanded tactics , germany has responded sharply to italian statements that germany , brazil , india and japan resorted to blackmail to secure permanent seats on the un security council . in dramatically undiplomatic language , the italian ambassador to the un this week , marcello spatafora , accused germany , brazil , india and japan , the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- of engaging in blackmail and financial threats in order to win support for their bid . " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " spatafora noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " both the german foreign and development ministries responded strongly to the accusations that the g4 were linking their development aid money to support for their candidacy . " these are naturally unsustainable accusations and i can only reject them quite bluntly , " said foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner .
" they are completely baseless . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- insisted that germany gives its aid according to transparent criteria in accordance with international rules from the organization for economic development and cooperation -lrb- oecd -rrb- . spatafora , who alleged the g4 was " blackmailing some sectors of the membership , ” said one country from the group had withdrawn a 370,000-euro -lrb- $ 460,000 -rrb- development project for children from a recipient country which chose not to support the g4 resolution .
he didn ’ t specify names , but his mention of a donor country indirectly pointed the finger at germany or japan , the major aid contributors among the group . japan also dismissed the allegations as groundless . underhanded tactics not new to un ? but un expert andreas zumach said such arm-twisting would not be new to the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this kind of behavior , of blackmailing , of threatening to withdraw development aid or other financial contributions , is not surprising , " said zumach .
" it 's really not new .
we 've seen it many times .
the last most specific case was during the iraq conflict when the us and also britain tried to blackmail members of the security council - especially from africa and latin america - into voting for a resolution authorizing the war against iraq . " the g4 have proposed increasing security council membership from 15 to 25 .
six of the new members would have permanent seats - one each for the four countries and two for african nations - but without veto powers .
the proposal is backed by more than 30 countries , including france and britain . italy sore about being left out ? but one of its key critics is italy .
again that ’ s no surprise , according to zumach . " right from the start of the debate about reforming the security council , which was 11 years ago , the italian government was adamantly against only germany getting a permanent seat while italy would not get one , " said zumach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-4 the g4 position has also been opposed by the african union , which wants the new permanent members to hold veto powers . the g4 and au will be meeting next week for yet another round of discussions .
experts believe they may well reach a compromise this time . rina goldenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy accuses g4 of foul play italy has accused brazil , germany , india and japan of resorting to blackmail in their bid to secure permanent seats on the un security council and backed a rival proposal for council enlargement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .
for most public places there is no plan for emergency services , " she told the vrt television station . she said that all railway stations , metro stops , schools , museums and major shopping centers should draw up plans for how to respond in case of a terrorist attack .
currently of 714 such public places only 83 have such a plan , she said . an attack would lead to chaos , governor says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " barely a third of the 68 metro stations are prepared " and " an attack would lead to chaos , " said paulus de chatelet , head of the administrative area covering brussels and 19 districts surrounding it . " the starting point of everything is a map - that is , where are the entry and exit points , where are there water supplies which the fire services can use ? " she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .
" it is true that as of today we 've computerized one third of the data .
that will be the case for all stations by the end of the year , " spokesman kris lauwers told vrt radio brussels firefighters have conceded however that museums , large shops and hospitals are not all up to date with emergency plans , vrt said . spread of fear makes capital jittery the comments came as two alerts in brussels reflected police jitters following recent events in london , where have left the british capital on high alert .
on tuesday morning , part of brussels ' gare du nord station was sealed off after a suspect suitcase was found .
it was blown up by bomb disposal experts , but was found to be empty , the belga news agency said .
later in the day part of a key road leading from the capital 's eu district into the centre of brussels was sealed off after a bomb threat , belga reported citing police .
a company also received a telephone warning that a bomb was about to explode .
the road where it is located was blocked for about half an hour , until the all-clear was given . eu officials only assume measures will be taken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to fears that the heart of europe was vulnerable , a spokesman for the european commission , the eu 's executive arm which employs thousands of staff in buildings dotted around brussels , said eu institutions are in constant contact with belgian authorities to ensure security .
" if measures do need to be taken , that 's to be done by the belgian authorities and we assume that they will be taken , " spokesman michael mann said . as well as the eu commission , brussels also plays host to the european parliament and the european council building , which hosts regular meetings of eu ministers and leaders . major cities across europe have been on high alert since july 7 when a wave of attacks killed 56 people on london 's underground train network and a bus .
after the london attacks , the bloc asked its top terrorism official gijs de vries to assess the emergency response plans of all eu states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .
-lrb- july 9 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : europe in the terror trap last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .

" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 us , asian nations unveil climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , america wo n't sign it - they have another idea the us and five asia-pacific nations on thursday unveiled a pact they said would reduce global warming but critics - including germany 's environment minister - said it was no alternative to the kyoto protocol . the united states , australia , india , china , south korea and japan said the " beyond kyoto " pact envisions the development of nuclear and solar power to reduce greenhouse gases , and was not a threat to the existing kyoto protocol . " we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .
and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world .
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- what can the world expect post-kyoto ?

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .
for most public places there is no plan for emergency services , " she told the vrt television station . she said that all railway stations , metro stops , schools , museums and major shopping centers should draw up plans for how to respond in case of a terrorist attack .
currently of 714 such public places only 83 have such a plan , she said . an attack would lead to chaos , governor says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " barely a third of the 68 metro stations are prepared " and " an attack would lead to chaos , " said paulus de chatelet , head of the administrative area covering brussels and 19 districts surrounding it . " the starting point of everything is a map - that is , where are the entry and exit points , where are there water supplies which the fire services can use ? " she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .
" it is true that as of today we 've computerized one third of the data .
that will be the case for all stations by the end of the year , " spokesman kris lauwers told vrt radio brussels firefighters have conceded however that museums , large shops and hospitals are not all up to date with emergency plans , vrt said . spread of fear makes capital jittery the comments came as two alerts in brussels reflected police jitters following recent events in london , where have left the british capital on high alert .
on tuesday morning , part of brussels ' gare du nord station was sealed off after a suspect suitcase was found .
it was blown up by bomb disposal experts , but was found to be empty , the belga news agency said .
later in the day part of a key road leading from the capital 's eu district into the centre of brussels was sealed off after a bomb threat , belga reported citing police .
a company also received a telephone warning that a bomb was about to explode .
the road where it is located was blocked for about half an hour , until the all-clear was given . eu officials only assume measures will be taken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to fears that the heart of europe was vulnerable , a spokesman for the european commission , the eu 's executive arm which employs thousands of staff in buildings dotted around brussels , said eu institutions are in constant contact with belgian authorities to ensure security .
" if measures do need to be taken , that 's to be done by the belgian authorities and we assume that they will be taken , " spokesman michael mann said . as well as the eu commission , brussels also plays host to the european parliament and the european council building , which hosts regular meetings of eu ministers and leaders . major cities across europe have been on high alert since july 7 when a wave of attacks killed 56 people on london 's underground train network and a bus .
after the london attacks , the bloc asked its top terrorism official gijs de vries to assess the emergency response plans of all eu states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .
-lrb- july 9 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : europe in the terror trap last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy .

and the photographers captured it all : merkel 's jacket-skirt combination in neutral apricot , her tousled hair , reserved smile , friendly wave - and the dark fleck that sprouted from her armpit , proof that the conservative leader does indeed sweat . apparently disturbed that merkel exposed herself to be a mere mortal , a picture editor at public broadcaster br 's web site - and ostensible cdu voter - gave the lady a helping hand with some digital trickery , blotting away the unsightly stain that marred her fancy dress . the - spotless - image of merkel alongside her husband , joachim sauer , was part of a br-online picture gallery of celebrities sighted at the opening night of the festival .
br has since taken the retouched photo off the site , its multimedia chief , rainer tief , said wednesday , adding that altering the picture violated the broadcaster 's principles . merkel , who recently went through an image make-over to soften her severe appearance , has yet to comment on the incident .

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .
for most public places there is no plan for emergency services , " she told the vrt television station . she said that all railway stations , metro stops , schools , museums and major shopping centers should draw up plans for how to respond in case of a terrorist attack .
currently of 714 such public places only 83 have such a plan , she said . an attack would lead to chaos , governor says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " barely a third of the 68 metro stations are prepared " and " an attack would lead to chaos , " said paulus de chatelet , head of the administrative area covering brussels and 19 districts surrounding it . " the starting point of everything is a map - that is , where are the entry and exit points , where are there water supplies which the fire services can use ? " she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .
" it is true that as of today we 've computerized one third of the data .
that will be the case for all stations by the end of the year , " spokesman kris lauwers told vrt radio brussels firefighters have conceded however that museums , large shops and hospitals are not all up to date with emergency plans , vrt said . spread of fear makes capital jittery the comments came as two alerts in brussels reflected police jitters following recent events in london , where have left the british capital on high alert .
on tuesday morning , part of brussels ' gare du nord station was sealed off after a suspect suitcase was found .
it was blown up by bomb disposal experts , but was found to be empty , the belga news agency said .
later in the day part of a key road leading from the capital 's eu district into the centre of brussels was sealed off after a bomb threat , belga reported citing police .
a company also received a telephone warning that a bomb was about to explode .
the road where it is located was blocked for about half an hour , until the all-clear was given . eu officials only assume measures will be taken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to fears that the heart of europe was vulnerable , a spokesman for the european commission , the eu 's executive arm which employs thousands of staff in buildings dotted around brussels , said eu institutions are in constant contact with belgian authorities to ensure security .
" if measures do need to be taken , that 's to be done by the belgian authorities and we assume that they will be taken , " spokesman michael mann said . as well as the eu commission , brussels also plays host to the european parliament and the european council building , which hosts regular meetings of eu ministers and leaders . major cities across europe have been on high alert since july 7 when a wave of attacks killed 56 people on london 's underground train network and a bus .
after the london attacks , the bloc asked its top terrorism official gijs de vries to assess the emergency response plans of all eu states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .
-lrb- july 9 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : europe in the terror trap last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .
the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .

it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .

germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 germany rejects blackmail allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german foreign ministry , led by fischer , has denied any foul play stung by allegations of using underhanded tactics , germany has responded sharply to italian statements that germany , brazil , india and japan resorted to blackmail to secure permanent seats on the un security council . in dramatically undiplomatic language , the italian ambassador to the un this week , marcello spatafora , accused germany , brazil , india and japan , the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- of engaging in blackmail and financial threats in order to win support for their bid . " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " spatafora noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " both the german foreign and development ministries responded strongly to the accusations that the g4 were linking their development aid money to support for their candidacy . " these are naturally unsustainable accusations and i can only reject them quite bluntly , " said foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner .
" they are completely baseless . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- insisted that germany gives its aid according to transparent criteria in accordance with international rules from the organization for economic development and cooperation -lrb- oecd -rrb- . spatafora , who alleged the g4 was " blackmailing some sectors of the membership , ” said one country from the group had withdrawn a 370,000-euro -lrb- $ 460,000 -rrb- development project for children from a recipient country which chose not to support the g4 resolution .
he didn ’ t specify names , but his mention of a donor country indirectly pointed the finger at germany or japan , the major aid contributors among the group . japan also dismissed the allegations as groundless . underhanded tactics not new to un ? but un expert andreas zumach said such arm-twisting would not be new to the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this kind of behavior , of blackmailing , of threatening to withdraw development aid or other financial contributions , is not surprising , " said zumach .
" it 's really not new .
we 've seen it many times .
the last most specific case was during the iraq conflict when the us and also britain tried to blackmail members of the security council - especially from africa and latin america - into voting for a resolution authorizing the war against iraq . " the g4 have proposed increasing security council membership from 15 to 25 .
six of the new members would have permanent seats - one each for the four countries and two for african nations - but without veto powers .
the proposal is backed by more than 30 countries , including france and britain . italy sore about being left out ? but one of its key critics is italy .
again that ’ s no surprise , according to zumach . " right from the start of the debate about reforming the security council , which was 11 years ago , the italian government was adamantly against only germany getting a permanent seat while italy would not get one , " said zumach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-4 the g4 position has also been opposed by the african union , which wants the new permanent members to hold veto powers . the g4 and au will be meeting next week for yet another round of discussions .
experts believe they may well reach a compromise this time . rina goldenberg -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy accuses g4 of foul play italy has accused brazil , germany , india and japan of resorting to blackmail in their bid to secure permanent seats on the un security council and backed a rival proposal for council enlargement .

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .
for most public places there is no plan for emergency services , " she told the vrt television station . she said that all railway stations , metro stops , schools , museums and major shopping centers should draw up plans for how to respond in case of a terrorist attack .
currently of 714 such public places only 83 have such a plan , she said . an attack would lead to chaos , governor says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " barely a third of the 68 metro stations are prepared " and " an attack would lead to chaos , " said paulus de chatelet , head of the administrative area covering brussels and 19 districts surrounding it . " the starting point of everything is a map - that is , where are the entry and exit points , where are there water supplies which the fire services can use ? " she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .
" it is true that as of today we 've computerized one third of the data .
that will be the case for all stations by the end of the year , " spokesman kris lauwers told vrt radio brussels firefighters have conceded however that museums , large shops and hospitals are not all up to date with emergency plans , vrt said . spread of fear makes capital jittery the comments came as two alerts in brussels reflected police jitters following recent events in london , where have left the british capital on high alert .
on tuesday morning , part of brussels ' gare du nord station was sealed off after a suspect suitcase was found .
it was blown up by bomb disposal experts , but was found to be empty , the belga news agency said .

it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
" having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .
for most public places there is no plan for emergency services , " she told the vrt television station . she said that all railway stations , metro stops , schools , museums and major shopping centers should draw up plans for how to respond in case of a terrorist attack .
currently of 714 such public places only 83 have such a plan , she said . an attack would lead to chaos , governor says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " barely a third of the 68 metro stations are prepared " and " an attack would lead to chaos , " said paulus de chatelet , head of the administrative area covering brussels and 19 districts surrounding it . " the starting point of everything is a map - that is , where are the entry and exit points , where are there water supplies which the fire services can use ? " she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .
" it is true that as of today we 've computerized one third of the data .
that will be the case for all stations by the end of the year , " spokesman kris lauwers told vrt radio brussels firefighters have conceded however that museums , large shops and hospitals are not all up to date with emergency plans , vrt said . spread of fear makes capital jittery the comments came as two alerts in brussels reflected police jitters following recent events in london , where have left the british capital on high alert .
on tuesday morning , part of brussels ' gare du nord station was sealed off after a suspect suitcase was found .
it was blown up by bomb disposal experts , but was found to be empty , the belga news agency said .
later in the day part of a key road leading from the capital 's eu district into the centre of brussels was sealed off after a bomb threat , belga reported citing police .
a company also received a telephone warning that a bomb was about to explode .
the road where it is located was blocked for about half an hour , until the all-clear was given . eu officials only assume measures will be taken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to fears that the heart of europe was vulnerable , a spokesman for the european commission , the eu 's executive arm which employs thousands of staff in buildings dotted around brussels , said eu institutions are in constant contact with belgian authorities to ensure security .
" if measures do need to be taken , that 's to be done by the belgian authorities and we assume that they will be taken , " spokesman michael mann said . as well as the eu commission , brussels also plays host to the european parliament and the european council building , which hosts regular meetings of eu ministers and leaders . major cities across europe have been on high alert since july 7 when a wave of attacks killed 56 people on london 's underground train network and a bus .
after the london attacks , the bloc asked its top terrorism official gijs de vries to assess the emergency response plans of all eu states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .
-lrb- july 9 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : europe in the terror trap last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

a two-day united nations ’ meeting on climate change is taking place in the german city of bonn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
" having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop . the sun beat down on the christian democratic union leader as she trod the red carpet on her way to the opening performance of " tristan and isolde " in bayreuth on monday .
and the photographers captured it all : merkel 's jacket-skirt combination in neutral apricot , her tousled hair , reserved smile , friendly wave - and the dark fleck that sprouted from her armpit , proof that the conservative leader does indeed sweat . apparently disturbed that merkel exposed herself to be a mere mortal , a picture editor at public broadcaster br 's web site - and ostensible cdu voter - gave the lady a helping hand with some digital trickery , blotting away the unsightly stain that marred her fancy dress . the - spotless - image of merkel alongside her husband , joachim sauer , was part of a br-online picture gallery of celebrities sighted at the opening night of the festival .
br has since taken the retouched photo off the site , its multimedia chief , rainer tief , said wednesday , adding that altering the picture violated the broadcaster 's principles . merkel , who recently went through an image make-over to soften her severe appearance , has yet to comment on the incident .
in any case , the country will surely be watching her even more closely as outdoor temperatures - and the german election campaign - heat up . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bright prospects for merkel double she may not have been thrilled with the comparison at first , but a housewife from lübeck is enjoying a burgeoning career as chancellor candidate angela merkel 's double .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 us , asian nations unveil climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , america wo n't sign it - they have another idea the us and five asia-pacific nations on thursday unveiled a pact they said would reduce global warming but critics - including germany 's environment minister - said it was no alternative to the kyoto protocol . the united states , australia , india , china , south korea and japan said the " beyond kyoto " pact envisions the development of nuclear and solar power to reduce greenhouse gases , and was not a threat to the existing kyoto protocol . " we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 us , asian nations unveil climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , america wo n't sign it - they have another idea the us and five asia-pacific nations on thursday unveiled a pact they said would reduce global warming but critics - including germany 's environment minister - said it was no alternative to the kyoto protocol . the united states , australia , india , china , south korea and japan said the " beyond kyoto " pact envisions the development of nuclear and solar power to reduce greenhouse gases , and was not a threat to the existing kyoto protocol . " we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .
the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 germany rejects blackmail allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german foreign ministry , led by fischer , has denied any foul play stung by allegations of using underhanded tactics , germany has responded sharply to italian statements that germany , brazil , india and japan resorted to blackmail to secure permanent seats on the un security council . in dramatically undiplomatic language , the italian ambassador to the un this week , marcello spatafora , accused germany , brazil , india and japan , the so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- of engaging in blackmail and financial threats in order to win support for their bid . " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " spatafora noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " both the german foreign and development ministries responded strongly to the accusations that the g4 were linking their development aid money to support for their candidacy . " these are naturally unsustainable accusations and i can only reject them quite bluntly , " said foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner .
" they are completely baseless . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- insisted that germany gives its aid according to transparent criteria in accordance with international rules from the organization for economic development and cooperation -lrb- oecd -rrb- . spatafora , who alleged the g4 was " blackmailing some sectors of the membership , ” said one country from the group had withdrawn a 370,000-euro -lrb- $ 460,000 -rrb- development project for children from a recipient country which chose not to support the g4 resolution .
he didn ’ t specify names , but his mention of a donor country indirectly pointed the finger at germany or japan , the major aid contributors among the group . japan also dismissed the allegations as groundless . underhanded tactics not new to un ? but un expert andreas zumach said such arm-twisting would not be new to the united nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this kind of behavior , of blackmailing , of threatening to withdraw development aid or other financial contributions , is not surprising , " said zumach .
" it 's really not new .
we 've seen it many times .
the last most specific case was during the iraq conflict when the us and also britain tried to blackmail members of the security council - especially from africa and latin america - into voting for a resolution authorizing the war against iraq . " the g4 have proposed increasing security council membership from 15 to 25 .
six of the new members would have permanent seats - one each for the four countries and two for african nations - but without veto powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .

" fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.07.2005 us , asian nations unveil climate deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , america wo n't sign it - they have another idea the us and five asia-pacific nations on thursday unveiled a pact they said would reduce global warming but critics - including germany 's environment minister - said it was no alternative to the kyoto protocol . the united states , australia , india , china , south korea and japan said the " beyond kyoto " pact envisions the development of nuclear and solar power to reduce greenhouse gases , and was not a threat to the existing kyoto protocol . " we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .
and rarely has there been such wide consensus that eight men have the power to change the world .
-lrb- july 5 , 2005 -rrb- what can the world expect post-kyoto ?

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .

that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .

" we are not detracting from kyoto in any way at all .
we are complementing it , " said us deputy secretary of state robert zoellick . zoellick said the agreement would " open up the possibilities for developing , deploying and transferring " new and more efficient technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in this photo released by the environmental group greenpeace , two greenpeace activists hold a sign supporting the kyoto protocol at a demonstration in a beijing park.china is one of the six nations to have agreed the " beyond kyoto " pact .
the six nations that agreed the pact after secret negotiations account for almost half of the world 's population and greenhouse gas emissions .
unlike the kyoto protocol , their non-binding pact does not have enforcement standards or a specific time-frame for signatories to cut emissions . immediate criticism the environmental group world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- dismissed the plan after us president george w. bush announced it in washington on wednesday . " a deal on climate change that does n't limit pollution is the same as a peace plan that allows guns to be fired , " said jennifer morgan , head of the wwf 's climate change program . german environment minister jürgen trittin said that while such regional pacts could support international cooperation on climate change , they were " no alternative " to the binding emissions goals included in kyoto . " we should not only develop new technologies , but also use existing technologies , for example , to increase energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies , " trittin said . " fairer , more effective " australian foreign minister alexander downer said details of the new pact would be discussed at a meeting of ministers from the six nations in australia in november . while he said the new accord was not meant to detract from the kyoto protocol , australian prime minister john howard has said it is a better , more effective agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard " the fairness and effectiveness of this proposal will be superior to the kyoto protocal , " howard said .
" it demonstrates the very strong commitment of australia to reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to an understanding that it 's fair in australia and not something that will destroy australian jobs and unfairly penalize australian industries . " one of the arguments used against the kyoto protocol by australia and the us is that it does not require big developing countries to make targeted emissions cuts - an absence that us president bush says is unfair and illogical . but developing countries say historical responsibility for global warming lies with nations that industrialized first , and primarily with the us , which alone accounts for a quarter of all global greenhouse gas pollution . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa , climate dominate g8 agenda rarely in the history of the g8 summit have so many expectations been foisted upon the world 's most powerful leaders .

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .
for most public places there is no plan for emergency services , " she told the vrt television station . she said that all railway stations , metro stops , schools , museums and major shopping centers should draw up plans for how to respond in case of a terrorist attack .
currently of 714 such public places only 83 have such a plan , she said . an attack would lead to chaos , governor says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " barely a third of the 68 metro stations are prepared " and " an attack would lead to chaos , " said paulus de chatelet , head of the administrative area covering brussels and 19 districts surrounding it . " the starting point of everything is a map - that is , where are the entry and exit points , where are there water supplies which the fire services can use ? " she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .
" it is true that as of today we 've computerized one third of the data .
that will be the case for all stations by the end of the year , " spokesman kris lauwers told vrt radio brussels firefighters have conceded however that museums , large shops and hospitals are not all up to date with emergency plans , vrt said . spread of fear makes capital jittery the comments came as two alerts in brussels reflected police jitters following recent events in london , where have left the british capital on high alert .
on tuesday morning , part of brussels ' gare du nord station was sealed off after a suspect suitcase was found .
it was blown up by bomb disposal experts , but was found to be empty , the belga news agency said .
later in the day part of a key road leading from the capital 's eu district into the centre of brussels was sealed off after a bomb threat , belga reported citing police .
a company also received a telephone warning that a bomb was about to explode .
the road where it is located was blocked for about half an hour , until the all-clear was given . eu officials only assume measures will be taken bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to fears that the heart of europe was vulnerable , a spokesman for the european commission , the eu 's executive arm which employs thousands of staff in buildings dotted around brussels , said eu institutions are in constant contact with belgian authorities to ensure security .
" if measures do need to be taken , that 's to be done by the belgian authorities and we assume that they will be taken , " spokesman michael mann said . as well as the eu commission , brussels also plays host to the european parliament and the european council building , which hosts regular meetings of eu ministers and leaders . major cities across europe have been on high alert since july 7 when a wave of attacks killed 56 people on london 's underground train network and a bus .
after the london attacks , the bloc asked its top terrorism official gijs de vries to assess the emergency response plans of all eu states before the end of the year . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .
-lrb- july 9 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : europe in the terror trap last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy .
-lrb- july 16 , 2005 -rrb- eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

" brussels is ill-prepared to confront potential attacks .

" she added . but according to vrt , the brussels subway operator mivb / stib said plans are in place for all metro stations , as well as for the network as a whole , and were shared with emergency services . mivb / stib said that hand-written plans of all subway stations were available to the city 's fire department and it had a separate internal emergency plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.07.2005 puma battling to tear stripe off adidas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : puma are pulling out all the stops to keep up with main rival adidas all 's fair in love , war ... and the sportswear market , apparently .
while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .
the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .
the case may revive the debate on antiquated soccer regulations .
-lrb- july 31 , 2004 -rrb- klinsi : no adidas boots , no world cup “ wear adidas boots or stay at home . ”
that ’ s the patriotic warning emanating from the office of german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann .
-lrb- may 6 , 2005 -rrb- puma gets new major shareholder two members of one of germany 's richest families , guenter and daniela herz , have become the major shareholders in puma , by amassing a stake of 16.91 percent in the maker of sportswear and equipment .

while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority . the 2006 fifa world cup in germany will not only act as the stage for crucial battles in the struggle for global soccer supremacy but will also provide sportswear firms with a platform on which they can jostle for position in one of the most competitive markets on earth . in the same way that their most high profile team , brazil , will be the ones to beat during the tournament so us sporting giant nike will be the label all the others will be hoping to eclipse .
and just as ronaldinho and co. assume the mantle of unassailability at every opportunity , even a strong showing by their nearest rivals will not be enough to eclipse nike , consistently the world 's leading brand . that leaves the also-rans battling for sales .
that battle is likely to be most intense in germany , the host country , where world number two and german powerhouse adidas will continue to fend off the challenge from its biggest domestic rival , puma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : safe in the knowledge that the german national team will be kitted out in its uniforms and hoofed in its footwear , and that the world cup tournament itself will be branded as an adidas-sponsored event , the munich-based sports behemoth could be excused for taking it easy next summer and reveling once more in the fact it is the german number one and second only in the world to probably the most ubiquitous sporting label ever seen . puma taking the fight to other market sectors while the fight may be a losing one in the soccer stakes , puma seems determined not to let adidas have it all their own way in the rest of the market .
the company unveiled a new strategy on wednesday which focused on the launch of new product ranges where the label with the predator cat hopes to catch the three-striped beast sleeping . puma unveiled its latest plan to compete with its larger rival by targeting areas in which there are no clearly dominant leaders , namely the lucrative golf market and motorcycle racing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jochen zeitz puma also revealed that it would be pursuing new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions .
" we are going to launch five new categories of products in the next five years , " chairman jochen zeitz announced at a press conference , with the emphasis on " lifestyle products " . the announcement of a plan to branch out comes at a time of increased confidence for puma which recorded a 12.6 percent rise in net profit to 58.9 million euros -lrb- $ 70.7 million -rrb- in the second quarter of this year , and an increase of 12.3 percent in sales to 395.5 million euros , mainly owing to strong growth in the united states and asia . the company has also shown the ambition to go toe-to-toe with adidas in the marketing stakes as it aims to move out of the shadow of its larger competitor and be recognized not only as a major german brand but a strong global one . bringing in the big guns of haute couture after adidas added britain 's stella mccartney and japan 's yohji yamamoto to its design team , puma hit back in may with the announcement that british designer alexander mcqueen would create a range of sports shoes for men and women which would become available in the market place in world cup year .
" i have always had a great passion for trainers , " said mcqueen , who has designed for givenchy and gucci , at the time . mcqueen joined a list of designers who had stepped outside the rarefied world of haute couture to bring a new twist to puma 's sportswear range .
puma has in the past used french design guru philippe starck and japanese designer yasuhiro mihara to create shoe lines and supermodel christy turlington has created a collection of clothes for yoga . adidas recruiting big names to stay ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi cradles his trophy after defeating germany 's tommy haas during the final of the tennis masters series at rome 's foro italico , sunday , may 12 , 2002 .
agassi beat haas 6-3 , 6-3 , 6-0 .
however , adidas continues to wield its increasing power to stay ahead of puma and keep up with nike .
recently , the germans executed a major coup over their major us rivals by poaching andre agassi after 17 seasons wearing a swoosh .
the 35-year-old american announced the sponsorship switch to adidas in june . adidas are also aware of the huge potential of non-linear partnerships , hooking up with partners outside the sporting world to get ahead in sectors such as the luxury sports market .
one such partnership will see adidas and porsche design develop and market luxury sports products , such as sports shoes , apparel , golf and tennis equipment , for a 2007 launch . so while the world cup may offer the two german firms the chance to battle it out on home turf for the scraps from nike 's table , the main event is shaping up in other areas of the sports market with both adidas and puma determined to do whatever they can to get the biggest slice before the other . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de puma lawsuit turns spotlight on dated soccer ideals german sports firm puma is suing world soccer body fifa after it punished the cameroon national team for wearing the company 's all-in-one uniform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.07.2005 tackling the birth-rate problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's falling birth rate is a source of some national alarm sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems . at issue are the impacts of a dwindling birth rate and an aging population on the economy and the workforce in decades to come .
it is not an immediate problem , nor is it one which will be unique to germany , but nonetheless , people here seem to have cottoned onto this distant prospect and woven it into the woes of the nation in a way that other europeans facing the same , or even worse predictions , have not .
the indicators do indeed show that there will be a disproportionate number of over 60s living in germany by 2050 , but what is it that makes the population of today worry so far ahead about a problem to which other nations seem to turn an ignorantly blind eye ? not a new problem steffen kröhnert of the berlin institute for world population and global development says there are two factors which fuel germany 's concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country needs more of these little ones " birth rates in germany have been falling since the seventies , whereas in other countries the trend only started ten years ago , and it takes time for people to take the problem on board , " kröhnert said . " but moreover , high unemployment levels led to a lot of talk about empty state coffers .
people were not worrying about demographic issues , but when they started to realize how the problems of the labor market were affecting national finances , they began to think differrently , " he added .
with arguments abounding that the density of the world population is already too much for our natural resources to sustain , there is the question of whether it is justifiable to continue pushing for greater human growth rates at all . kröhnert says the aim is not to spawn a continually bigger population , but to find ways of dealing with the steady decline and the reality that each generation is a third smaller than the one it succeeds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does germany really need more people ?
the economists say yes .
" it would be enough if the birth rate simply remained stable , but as long as it continues to fall , the imbalance can not be corrected , " he said .
seeking answers abroad katerina von schurbein , eu commission spokeswoman for employment , social affairs and equal opportunities , says europe will have to look beyond its own boundaries to tackle the problem . " by 2030 , the european workforce will be 20 million people short .
migration can help , but it wo n't be easy to bring the equivalent of two small eu countries into the continent , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoping for employment the very notion of such in germany 's current economic climate is enough to start a small revolution .
for although the impending societal imbalance is being taken at face value here , it is outdone in terms of severity by the more pressing issue of defiantly high unemployment figures .
germans with jobs are very protective of them , and those without are not keen to share the waiting list with an influx of work-hungry foreigners .
but kröhnert says that mentality is based on germany 's experience of unqualified migrant laborers , adding that country currently has no space for them , but needs influx of qualified workers .
making the most of it dealing with two ends of the same stick at one and the same time is a challenge to say the least , and sabine maass of the german ministry of economics and labor says that although the priority is reducing joblessness , the government is also looking ahead .
" we are working towards making the best use of all the potential which exists in germany .
that means increasing the average pension age , improving the situation for women , and improving childcare options , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future face of germany ?
but getting german women to have children and a career is a tall order .
even generous family allowance , affordable childcare and tax breaks are moderate motivators .
steffen kröhnert believes the lavish financial incentives offered by the german government are more a part of the problem than the cure .
" the money is being ploughed into the wrong places and does not reflect what people really want .
no other european country does so much to support the model of the man who goes out to work and takes on the sole financial responsibility for the family , " he said .
he refers in part ot germany 's tax system which is built around the old-fashioned idea that a man does the financial hunting and gathering for his family while the woman stays home and raises the children .
" countries like france have got it right in slashing tax for couples with two or more children , " kröhnert added .
and maybe he is right , because unlike germany , france is looking at a self-sustaining population in years to come . tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : graying germany germany 's older population is set to skyrocket over the next decades .
demographers forecast that by 2050 , more than one in three germans will be over 60 - due to low birth rates and longer life spans .
dw-world : a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
dw-world : " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .
but , a new study has found that societal hostility towards kids is preventing many germans from starting a family .

a study by husband and wife team ken and sue peattie from cardiff university has warned that tourism could go the same way as the tobacco industry .
skin cancer is the second most common form of cancer in the uk .
but frances tuke of the association of british travel agents -lrb- abta -rrb- , said tour operators were giving plenty of advice .
" obviously tour operators have a lot of information they have to give these days , such as foreign office advice but i think they are very responsible , " she said .
terrorism and crime seem to be at the forefront of people 's minds , yet in reality , a tourist is far more at likely to fall victim to health problems professor ken peattie " you 've got to remember that half of the holidaymakers from the uk travel completely independently . "
the peatties ' study was published in tourism management magazine to coincide with the start of the great summer getaway .
it questions if the tourism industry is doing enough to protect its customers " from one of the biggest killers of our generation " .
the authors , who worked in association with a leading australian dermatologist , criticised travel brochures for often showing bronzed sunbathers wearing next to no clothes .
the first signs of skin cancer can take as long as 30 years to show analysing attitudes to skin cancer , the report said the main reason it had become the second most common cancer in the uk was the huge increase in foreign travel , with the dangers far from the minds of people heading for the sun .
professor ken peattie , of the centre for business relationships , accountability , sustainability and society -lrb- brass -rrb- , said that when people went away they forget about the risks .
i hate to say it , but we live on an island that is often murky , dark , foggy and even wet and the attraction of going abroad , frankly , is that it 's sunny and warm frances tuke , abta " when tourism and risk are discussed , terrorism and crime seem to be at the forefront of people 's minds . , " he said , " yet in reality , a tourist is far more at likely to fall victim to health problems .

" there seems to be little incentive for travel agents to alert their customers to the potential health and other hazards present at their destination , " said professor ken peattie .
" when tourism and risk are discussed , terrorism and crime seem to be at the forefront of people 's minds .
yet in reality , a tourist is far more likely to fall victim to health problems . "
according to the researchers , the time lag between sun burn and the first signs of cancer was part of the problem .
they claimed the delay has allowed the tourist industry to get away without facing its responsibilities .
but they warned people suffering from skin cancer could soon start pushing claims through the courts for a failure of the industry to protect them from the effects of over-exposure to the sun .
but ms tuke of abta said : " i hate to say it , but we live on an island that is often murky , dark , foggy and even wet and the attraction of going abroad , frankly , is that it 's sunny and warm .
i 'm afraid that is just a fact of life .
" tour operators , like other people in business , have to consistently update their images and they will be reflecting a sign of times . "
abta also rejected the idea that the tourism industry could be blamed for health problems .
ms tuke said : " it would be extremely unfair to target tour operators when they are not the only cog in the holiday wheel . "
" the point of this research is not to consign the sunshine holiday to the past , " said dr sue peattie , " but to call on the tourist industry to start acting responsibly by warning customers about the long term risks associated with sunburn . "

the authors , who worked in association with a leading australian dermatologist , criticised travel brochures for often showing bronzed sunbathers wearing next to no clothes .
the first signs of skin cancer can take as long as 30 years to show analysing attitudes to skin cancer , the report said the main reason it had become the second most common cancer in the uk was the huge increase in foreign travel , with the dangers far from the minds of people heading for the sun .
professor ken peattie , of the centre for business relationships , accountability , sustainability and society -lrb- brass -rrb- , said that when people went away they forget about the risks .
i hate to say it , but we live on an island that is often murky , dark , foggy and even wet and the attraction of going abroad , frankly , is that it 's sunny and warm frances tuke , abta " when tourism and risk are discussed , terrorism and crime seem to be at the forefront of people 's minds . , " he said , " yet in reality , a tourist is far more at likely to fall victim to health problems . "
" there seems to be little incentive for travel agents to alert their customers to the potential health and other hazards present at their destination , " said professor ken peattie .
" when tourism and risk are discussed , terrorism and crime seem to be at the forefront of people 's minds .
yet in reality , a tourist is far more likely to fall victim to health problems . "
according to the researchers , the time lag between sun burn and the first signs of cancer was part of the problem .
they claimed the delay has allowed the tourist industry to get away without facing its responsibilities .
but they warned people suffering from skin cancer could soon start pushing claims through the courts for a failure of the industry to protect them from the effects of over-exposure to the sun .
but ms tuke of abta said : " i hate to say it , but we live on an island that is often murky , dark , foggy and even wet and the attraction of going abroad , frankly , is that it 's sunny and warm .
i 'm afraid that is just a fact of life .
" tour operators , like other people in business , have to consistently update their images and they will be reflecting a sign of times . "
abta also rejected the idea that the tourism industry could be blamed for health problems .
ms tuke said : " it would be extremely unfair to target tour operators when they are not the only cog in the holiday wheel . "
" the point of this research is not to consign the sunshine holiday to the past , " said dr sue peattie , " but to call on the tourist industry to start acting responsibly by warning customers about the long term risks associated with sunburn . "

the 26-strong group of women delivers up to 9,000 meals a year to 100 pensioners in the brecon area .
the group are concerned they may have to undergo police checks and be trained to recognise abuse suffered by clients .
powys council said the training was not compulsory and 2,500 other volunteers had already undertaken the course .
' common sense ' the volunteers in the brecon and district meals on wheels service have been delivering meals on wheels for decades .
organiser vivienne williams said working practices had previously been agreed with council social services who cook the meals and provide transport .
but she said the women , aged in their 60s and 70s , became concerned when it was suggested they would have to undergo police checks and be trained in how to spot signs of abuse among their clients as part of a new contract .
mrs williams said : " there 's been no problem at all for 37 years .
" the ladies were advised on health and safety and food hygiene which was common sense , but this year things have changed .
final meals " we are all volunteers and we felt that we did n't want the extra bureaucracy and responsibility .
" we are sadly withdrawing the service because we feel police checks and being trained to spot abuse is a bridge too far . "
the volunteers are due to take out their last meals on friday .
mrs williams added : " it 's very sad the service is going to end like this - we felt we were a valuable asset . "
dorothy price , 83 , who has been receiving meals on wheels from the volunteers said : " i was so used to the people coming into me , the same ones every week .
" it will take a long time to get used to anyone else . "
powys council said the training would not be compulsory but was recommended .
it added that the women 's royal voluntary service would step in to deliver the meals .
the council 's chief executive , mark kerr , said : " if we have people who are going into an isolated elderly person 's house on a fairly frequent basis , it seems to me to be common sense to train them to look for circumstances that might not be favourable . "

the chinese are fascinated by history the group of about 80 people from the chinese mainland were the first to visit the uk under new relaxed visa regulations .
" i 'm so excited .
it 's very interesting , " said tang qi , a student from shanghai , as the group were whisked through the museum at lightning speed .
his friend , han chi dong , said he had enjoyed looking at ancient chinese clothing and ceramics in the victoria and albert museum that morning .
he said he had never seen anything like it in his home country .
" i did n't travel many places in china because i was studying ! " he said .
tang qi and han chi dong said they enjoyed the cultural sites before the uk gained approved destination status -lsb- ads -rsb- in china this month , chinese nationals could only visit the uk on business or study visas , or on holiday visas which required sponsorship by someone living in the country .
now , the tourism organisation visit britain predicts the uk will see some 200,000 visitors from china by 2010 , giving it a market worth more than £ 500m by 2020 .
" the uk is a very attractive city to china because lots of chinese have heard of sherlock holmes , winston churchill ...
china is a nation that loves history , " said stephanie cheng from uk tour operator china holidays .
" but i think the number of tourists will come to uk in a steady way , " she added .
the first tour group have a packed itinerary which is designed to give them a taster of all that the uk has to offer to chinese visitors .
carl walsh , visit britain 's overseas markets manager , said the tour included destinations which indulge china 's fascination with shakespeare -lrb- stratford -rrb- , david beckham -lrb- manchester -rrb- , winston churchill -lrb- blenheim palace -rrb- and whisky -lrb- scotland -rrb- .
in london , museums were high on the agenda .
the visitors found a familiar face in madame tussauds patty rowe , a mandarin-speaking blue badge guide who works in london , said the chinese gallery of the british museum was popular " because they like to hear how many items have been looted to here " .
the tower of london is also popular .
" they do n't have a monarch and like to find out more about the royals , especially diana 's story , " ms rowe said .
shopping will also be a key part of the programme - the group will visit the bicester village retail park .
" they just love anything with a brand name , " said mr walsh .
a business group was recently taken to bicester village and " basically , they just cleaned out clarks shoes ! " he added .
not cheap china 's tourists are valuable to the uk because of their expected numbers , but also because of their wealth .
the ads stipulates that a visitor from china comes to the uk on an organised group tour .
attractions associated with royalty are a huge draw an eight-day trip , including flights , will cost around £ 1,000-1,100 -lrb- $ 1,743-1,917 -rrb- , and is therefore likely to only appeal to the elite who " spend their leisure time actually educating themselves " , said mr walsh .
" they would tend to take their accommodation in three-four star -lsb- hotels -rsb- max , and use their money to shop , " he said .
the uk tourism industry risks losing this potential , however , if it is not ready to receive its new visitors .
ms rowe noted that there were no mandarin leaflets offered in london 's major tourist sites .
she said that visitors relied on chinese guide books instead , " but some information is not accurate " .
mr walsh admitted hosting tourists from china would be " an education process " .
he said visit britain would produce some " how-to guides " for those in the service industry .
hotels would be recommended to employ mandarin speakers , he said , and place items in the rooms that chinese visitors would appreciate : carpet slippers , disposable toothbrushes - and pot noodles .
" the little things make a difference , " he said .

so claims the fortean times , which keeps a keen eye on global weirdness .
the magazine calls wales " one of the most haunted countries in the world " which is " overflowing with mystery " .
the wales tourist board 's heledd llewelyn parry said : " i 'm sure every town in wales has a story to tell about a ghost , myth or legend - and the welsh are so good at telling those stories . "

cafta will lower trade barriers between the us and six central american countries , with the aim of fostering prosperity and democracy in the region .
the house voted 217 to 215 in favour of the pact , despite opposition from democrats and a number of republicans .
president bush welcomed the decision , which he said would boost us business .
us senators last month voted in favour of the agreement , which now goes to the president for his signature before becoming law .
job fears the free trade pact brings together the us and costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua and the dominican republic .
" cafta helps ensure that free trade is fair trade , " president bush said in statement following the vote by representatives .
" by lowering trade barriers to american goods in central american markets to a level now enjoyed by their goods in the us , this agreement will level the playing field and help american workers , farmers and small businesses . "
however , opposition to the deal had remained strong ahead of the vote .
several senior white house aides , including vice president dick cheney and secretary of state condolezza rice , were drafted in shortly before the vote to help shore-up support in the republican-controlled house of representatives .
democrats were overwhelmingly opposed to the agreement , but 27 republicans also voted against it .
us textile and sugar industries and trade unions had opposed the deal , arguing heavy job losses in the us could result because of competition from countries where workers ' rights are poorly protected .
but supporters said cafta would eventually eliminate tariffs currently imposed on us sales in central america .
" we can not claim to be fighting for american jobs and yet turn our backs on 44 million new customers in central america , " said republican representative kevin brady of texas .
along with the six new nations within cafta - and the nafta agreement with canada and mexico - the us currently has free trade agreements with australia , chile , singapore , jordan and israel .

cafta will lower trade barriers between the us and six central american countries , with the aim of fostering prosperity and democracy in the region .
the house voted 217 to 215 in favour of the pact , despite opposition from democrats and a number of republicans .
president bush welcomed the decision , which he said would boost us business .
us senators last month voted in favour of the agreement , which now goes to the president for his signature before becoming law .
job fears the free trade pact brings together the us and costa rica , el salvador , guatemala , honduras , nicaragua and the dominican republic .
" cafta helps ensure that free trade is fair trade , " president bush said in statement following the vote by representatives .
" by lowering trade barriers to american goods in central american markets to a level now enjoyed by their goods in the us , this agreement will level the playing field and help american workers , farmers and small businesses . "
however , opposition to the deal had remained strong ahead of the vote .
several senior white house aides , including vice president dick cheney and secretary of state condolezza rice , were drafted in shortly before the vote to help shore-up support in the republican-controlled house of representatives .
democrats were overwhelmingly opposed to the agreement , but 27 republicans also voted against it .
us textile and sugar industries and trade unions had opposed the deal , arguing heavy job losses in the us could result because of competition from countries where workers ' rights are poorly protected .
but supporters said cafta would eventually eliminate tariffs currently imposed on us sales in central america .
" we can not claim to be fighting for american jobs and yet turn our backs on 44 million new customers in central america , " said republican representative kevin brady of texas .
along with the six new nations within cafta - and the nafta agreement with canada and mexico - the us currently has free trade agreements with australia , chile , singapore , jordan and israel .

canadian baba brinkman wants modern teenagers to warm to the 14th-century canterbury tales .
he is to tour english schools with his versions of the pardoner 's tale , miller 's tale and wife of bath 's tale .
some of chaucer 's original bawdier language had to be " toned down " for his young audience .
miller light baba told the bbc news website : " all the themes of rap music are there in the tales : jealousy , anger , greed , lust .
" the miller 's tale in particular contains a lot of references to genitalia and body humour .
some of it had to be censored to make it suitable for children . "
baba had the idea of converting chaucer into rap when he was doing a masters ' degree on the poet in the late 1990s .
chaucer was an innovator in his use of english he said : " i tried to keep the rap versions as close as possible to the original , so i went through the tales line-by-line .
" it was a painstaking process to convert chaucer into a rhyme scheme that young people would like . "
the tales have been condensed for performance , but with the aim of maintaining their original sense .
for instance , the phrase " goone towards that village " translates to " hit the streets " .
getting it down baba said : " my work is really part of a tradition because chaucer took his tales from classical literature and put them into the english used in his day .
it was an original thing to do .
" the knight 's tale came from a 10,000-line story from boccaccio , which chaucer brought down to 2,000 .
the rap version takes it to 400 lines .
" i do n't want to replace chaucer 's version , which is wonderful , but it should help young people to see how vibrant his stories are and make them more interested . "
his visits to classes of 15 and 16-year-olds are part of a cambridge university project to encourage children to love literature .
research associate sarah james said : " sometimes children find chaucer 's language hard to understand as it 's 600 years old .
" rap is a wonderful way to get through that and hooking them into the stories .
hopefully it will inspire some of them to go further and read the original texts . "
baba 's motives might not be very far removed from chaucer 's .
ms james said : " we know , from several illustrated medieval manuscripts , that chaucer 's works were read aloud for entertainment .
" most people in those days could not read and even those who could would have found books very expensive .
" baba is fantastic at conveying the sense of poetry and storytelling . "
chaucer , who lived from around 1340 to 1400 , was also a courtier and diplomat .
six of his tales were adapted into modern-day tv versions for the bbc 's chaucer 's canterbury tales in 2003 .

the uk 's largest fixed-line telecoms operator said first quarter pre-tax profits rose to £ 499m -lrb- $ 875m -rrb- , while revenue improved 5 % .
revenues also got a boost from recent acquisitions infonet and radianz and the buyout of italian firm albacom .
" this has been a great first quarter , " said chief executive ben verwaayen .
bt 's shares closed up 2.5 % at 229 pence .
bt group said global orders for it services were worth £ 2.4bn in the three months to 30 june , including a deal with the uk ministry of defence .
it services orders topped £ 8bn during the last 12 months , a company record .
competition pressure profits were also helped by a 48 % rise to £ 1.38bn in " new wave " services , the phone company 's term for newer products like broadband internet and mobile services .
the number of wholesale broadband connections in the year more than doubled to £ 5.6m.
bt is keen to increase profit margins in " new wave " services to counter growing competition in traditional fixed-line services .
revenues from its traditional businesses fell by 6 % .
the decline was due to increased competition , price cuts and changes to encourage customers to take up new wave services , bt said .
in june , bt group agreed to offer rival operators equal access to its uk fixed-line network to avert the risk that regulators might order the company to be broken up .
after talks with telecoms watchdog ofcom , bt agreed to set up a separate business unit to provide other telecoms operators with equal access to its uk-wide local network .
the move followed complaints from rivals that the ex-monopoly 's network-owning wholesale division was giving preferential treatment to bt 's retail arm .

although none is thought to have hit the orbiter , two shielding tiles on discovery do appear to be damaged .
managers described the findings as " unacceptable " and said other orbiters would not be safe to fly until changes were made to the launcher system .
" until we fix this , we 're not ready to go fly again , " said bill parsons .
" i am personally disappointed that this happened , but it did n't harm the orbiter and we learned something , " the space shuttle programme manager added .
shuttle flip experts have been poring over video and still images of the launch .
discovery 's astronauts , too , have been examining the structural integrity of their orbiter with sensor and camera attachments on the end of a long robotic arm .
they also took images from their cockpit of the external tank immediately after it was jettisoned and was beginning its fall back to earth .

a six-inch -lrb- 15cm -rrb- foam chunk also fell from an area of the tank called the liquid hydrogen intertank flange .
this was an area where several modifications were made after the columbia disaster .
officials stressed there was no evidence that either piece of foam had hit discovery itself .
mr parsons said it was too early to say what implications this had for plans to send the atlantis orbiter into space in the event that discovery 's crew needed to be rescued ; but he vehemently denied suggestions that the orbiter system was inherently unsafe .
of the two heatshield tiles apparently damaged during launch , deputy programme manager wayne hale said : " are we concerned about it ?
we 're treating it very seriously , but we 're not losing sleep yet . "
a rectangular tile near the nose landing gear doors appeared to be chipped and a square " chine " tile further toward the aft -lrb- back -rrb- end of discovery also seemed to have broken away .
on thursday , discovery will do a flip manoeuvre before docking with the international space station .
this will allow the iss crew to photograph the underside of the spaceship .
' difficult business ' discovery 's mission is the first shuttle flight since the loss of columbia and its crew of seven in february 2003 .
shuttle programme managers do not believe the foam hit the shuttle its external tank shed a suitcase-sized piece of foam during launch that punched a hole in the ship 's wing , allowing super-heated gases to pierce the airframe during re-entry and pull it apart .
nasa spent months changing the way the insulation was applied to the tank .
it was thought only small pieces of debris would come off during discovery 's launch .
" perfection is our goal in this business ; you seldom get perfection in anything you do .
we need to do better than this , " said mr hale .
" this is a very difficult business , it 's not for the faint-hearted and it 's not to be undertaken lightly . "
discovery is due to touch down at the kennedy space center on 7 august at 0546 edt -lrb- 0946 gmt ; 1046 bst -rrb- .

mr parsons said it was too early to say what implications this had for plans to send the atlantis orbiter into space in the event that discovery 's crew needed to be rescued ; but he vehemently denied suggestions that the orbiter system was inherently unsafe .
of the two heatshield tiles apparently damaged during launch , deputy programme manager wayne hale said : " are we concerned about it ?
we 're treating it very seriously , but we 're not losing sleep yet . "
a rectangular tile near the nose landing gear doors appeared to be chipped and a square " chine " tile further toward the aft -lrb- back -rrb- end of discovery also seemed to have broken away .
on thursday , discovery will do a flip manoeuvre before docking with the international space station .
this will allow the iss crew to photograph the underside of the spaceship .
' difficult business ' discovery 's mission is the first shuttle flight since the loss of columbia and its crew of seven in february 2003 .
shuttle programme managers do not believe the foam hit the shuttle its external tank shed a suitcase-sized piece of foam during launch that punched a hole in the ship 's wing , allowing super-heated gases to pierce the airframe during re-entry and pull it apart .
nasa spent months changing the way the insulation was applied to the tank .
it was thought only small pieces of debris would come off during discovery 's launch .
" perfection is our goal in this business ; you seldom get perfection in anything you do .
we need to do better than this , " said mr hale .
" this is a very difficult business , it 's not for the faint-hearted and it 's not to be undertaken lightly . "
discovery is due to touch down at the kennedy space center on 7 august at 0546 edt -lrb- 0946 gmt ; 1046 bst -rrb- .

it is believed to be the first case of its kind in the uk , but with an estimated one million wi-fi users around the country , it is unlikely to be the last .
" there are a lot of implications and this could open the floodgates to many more such cases , " said phil cracknell , chief technology officer of security firm netsurity .
details in this particular case are sketchy , although it is known that gregory straszkiewicz had " piggybacked " on a wireless broadband network of a local ealing resident , using a laptop while sitting in his car .
he had been seen in the area on several previous occasions over the past three months and is believed to have been reported to police by a neighbour concerned that he was acting suspiciously .
the case is some way away from that of brian salcedo , who was sentenced to nine years in a us jail last year for the far more serious crime of siphoning credit card numbers over the wireless network of hardware store lowes .
unauthorised access the criminal aspect of the case of salcedo is obvious and is clearly reflected in the sentence dished out .
but the crime committed in the case of straszkiewicz , where he appears simply to have used the network , is perhaps less obvious .
not to simon janes , a former head of the computer crime unit and now operations manager for computer forensics firm ibas .
" gaining unauthorised access to someone else 's network is an offence and people have to take responsibility for their actions .
some people might argue that taking a joy-ride in someone else 's car is not an offence either , " he said .
gaining unauthorised access to a computer is an offence covered by the computer misuse act .
in straszkiewcz 's case , he was prosecuted under the communications act and found guilty of dishonestly obtaining an electronic communications service .
" i guess , and it is a guess , that they could n't prove he accessed the actual computer and that is why they used another legal avenue , " said mr janes .
but whatever route the case took , the outcome proves that borrowing someone else 's network is not as harmless as the hobbyist wi-fi user might think .
lax security it is not just those people driving around in search of a " free " network who have to worry . "
the perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user " simon janes , ibas people with criminal intentions have , in the past , attempted to use the openness of their own wireless networks to cover their tracks online .
" there have been incidences where paedophiles deliberately leave their wireless networks open so that , if caught , they can say that is was n't them that used the network for illegal purposes , " said netsurity 's mr cracknell .
such a defence would hold little water as the person installing the network , be they a home user or a business , has ultimate responsibility for any criminal activity that takes place on that network , whether it be launching a hack attack or downloading illegal pornography .
despite this , businesses and residential users continue to fail to take that responsibility seriously by securing their networks , said mr cracknell .
a joint survey by rsa security and netsurity , conducted in march of this year , found that more than a third of wireless networks in london and frankfurt had the basic security features turned off .
many had failed to turn on the encryption that scrambles the data traffic between users and the access point .
freebie wi-fi " the perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user , " said mr janes .
mr cracknell called for an awareness campaign , similar to the one recently run on tv highlighting the threats of identity theft .
the perception in the past has been that borrowing a bit of bandwidth is cheeky but not really criminal behaviour .
with wi-fi operating at speeds of up to 20 times faster than broadband it is unlikely to slow the system down noticeably unless the borrower is downloading huge files and , unless the owner of the network has intrusion detection software , he or she is unlikely to notice the squatters .
the fact that straszkiewicz narrowly escaped a harsher sentence , had to pay a £ 500 fine and had his laptop and wireless card confiscated indicates such squatting might not be worthwhile .
detective constable stephone rothwell from ealing cid was involved in the case and said future cases would be treated in the same way .
" this case is the first of its type in the united kingdom and it sets an example to people who use increased computer technology to try and avoid paying for the internet , " he said .
it could be that the days of freebie wi-fi are coming to an end .

it is believed to be the first case of its kind in the uk , but with an estimated one million wi-fi users around the country , it is unlikely to be the last .
" there are a lot of implications and this could open the floodgates to many more such cases , " said phil cracknell , chief technology officer of security firm netsurity .
details in this particular case are sketchy , although it is known that gregory straszkiewicz had " piggybacked " on a wireless broadband network of a local ealing resident , using a laptop while sitting in his car .
he had been seen in the area on several previous occasions over the past three months and is believed to have been reported to police by a neighbour concerned that he was acting suspiciously .
the case is some way away from that of brian salcedo , who was sentenced to nine years in a us jail last year for the far more serious crime of siphoning credit card numbers over the wireless network of hardware store lowes .
unauthorised access the criminal aspect of the case of salcedo is obvious and is clearly reflected in the sentence dished out .
wireless networks at home give people freedom to move about but the crime committed in the case of straszkiewicz , where he appears simply to have used the network , is perhaps less obvious .
not to simon janes , a former head of the computer crime unit and now operations manager for computer forensics firm ibas .
" gaining unauthorised access to someone else 's network is an offence and people have to take responsibility for their actions .
some people might argue that taking a joy-ride in someone else 's car is not an offence either , " he said .
gaining unauthorised access to a computer is an offence covered by the computer misuse act .
in straszkiewcz 's case , he was prosecuted under the communications act and found guilty of dishonestly obtaining an electronic communications service .
" i guess , and it is a guess , that they could n't prove he accessed the actual computer and that is why they used another legal avenue , " said mr janes .
but whatever route the case took , the outcome proves that borrowing someone else 's network is not as harmless as the hobbyist wi-fi user might think .
lax security it is not just those people driving around in search of a " free " network who have to worry .
the perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user simon janes , ibas people with criminal intentions have , in the past , attempted to use the openness of their own wireless networks to cover their tracks online .
" there have been incidences where paedophiles deliberately leave their wireless networks open so that , if caught , they can say that is was n't them that used the network for illegal purposes , " said netsurity 's mr cracknell .
such a defence would hold little water as the person installing the network , be they a home user or a business , has ultimate responsibility for any criminal activity that takes place on that network , whether it be launching a hack attack or downloading illegal pornography .
despite this , businesses and residential users continue to fail to take that responsibility seriously by securing their networks , said mr cracknell .
a joint survey by rsa security and netsurity , conducted in march of this year , found that more than a third of wireless networks in london and frankfurt had the basic security features turned off .
many had failed to turn on the encryption that scrambles the data traffic between users and the access point .
freebie wi-fi " the perception among domestic users is that providing security is difficult and it does depend on the competence of the user , " said mr janes .
mr cracknell called for an awareness campaign , similar to the one recently run on tv highlighting the threats of identity theft .
the perception in the past has been that borrowing a bit of bandwidth is cheeky but not really criminal behaviour .
with wi-fi operating at speeds of up to 20 times faster than broadband it is unlikely to slow the system down noticeably unless the borrower is downloading huge files and , unless the owner of the network has intrusion detection software , he or she is unlikely to notice the squatters .
the fact that straszkiewicz narrowly escaped a harsher sentence , had to pay a £ 500 fine and had his laptop and wireless card confiscated indicates such squatting might not be worthwhile .
detective constable stephone rothwell from ealing cid was involved in the case and said future cases would be treated in the same way .
