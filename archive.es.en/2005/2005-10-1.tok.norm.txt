the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said . " by finding new , high-quality opportunities to reuse these materials we are showing that we care about the environment , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de picking designer homes off the rack the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .

with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .

considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .

" if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .

" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one . " trial a crucial test nonetheless , the trial was seen as a crucial test of spain 's way of fighting international terrorism through legal means . it 's a strategy supported by other european countries such as germany and france and involves long police investigations and intelligence gathering followed by the arrest of suspects and a trial . the methods stand in sharp contrast to the more aggressive policy followed by the united states that tends to rely on wars , military prisons and , where necessary , military rather than civil courts . fighting terrorism via the courts the stark difference in the two approaches means many observers were looking to the madrid trial to see whether the european approach was adequate in the face of global terrorism . bildunterschrift : juan aviles , a history professor and terrorism specialist at madrid 's open university said he was hopeful . " i think that this trial is a good hope of fighting international terrorism inside the law , " aviles said . " i am optimistic about this . " " regrettable and unfair " but defense lawyers complained bitterly about the way monday 's trial was conducted and the evidence that was admitted into court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the case of tayssir alouni -lrb- photo -rrb- , the al jazeera correspondent who interviewed osama bin laden , the judges were convinced , on the basis of phone conversations and records of meetings , that alouni did use his position as a journalist to help al qaeda . human rights groups too have been closely watching the trial , along with members of al jazeera . al jazeerah 's editor in chief , ahmad sheik , was devastated when alouni received a sentence of seven years in prison .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said . " by finding new , high-quality opportunities to reuse these materials we are showing that we care about the environment , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de picking designer homes off the rack the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .

league leaders munich did the minimum to win against wolfsburg , and hamburg kept on munich 's heels with a win against kaiserslautern . werder bremen scored twice in the last five minutes to beat hertha berlin 2-1 in what was a thrilling match for second-place in the bundesliga .
the goals came about after berlin had wasted much of their energy trying to put more distance between themselves and the 2003-04 champions .
pal dardai had put the hosts on top in front of 64,629 jubilant fans in the 48th minute after a marko pantelic shot hit the left post .
dardai was the man on the spot and hammered the rebound home .
pantelic would later be denied a goal after the referee assistant mistakenly called him offside .
referee lutz wagner would later receive the wrath of berlin supporters and the team staff for not calling a penalty after a foul on yildiray bastürk inside the bremen penalty box in the 60th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho and bremen 's christian schulz fly through the air with the greatest of ease berlin sought to put the final nail in the bremen coffin but instead , sapped of their strength , they would find themselves under intense bremen pressure .
tim borowski launched a rocket in the 85th minute that berlin keeper christian fiedler had no chance at stopping .
then , in the 89th minute , nelson valdez headed home the winner for bremen .
" that was really a top-class game .
unfortunately the referee could n't perform at the same level , " team manager dieter hoeness remarked after the game .
munich unscathed at home the new allianz arena remained pure from the perspective of the bayern munich goalkeepers after coach felix magath 's side did what was necessary to secure a 2-0 victory over wolfsburg .
starting keeper oliver kahn was held from the match after injuring his shoulder , so oldie bernd dreher was given the nod .
he kept the net clean - no opponent has yet scored at the arena - against the wolves who seldom created top-notch opportunities .
roque santa cruz and lucio provided the goals for bayern .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's ze antonio - first goal in the bundesliga gives his side the win borussia mönchengladbach , who finished last season just above the relegation zone , are making a move towards the top third of the table , beating mainz 1-0 at home , their third victory in a row .
ze antonio scored the lone goal in the 32nd minute and gladbach now rest in sixth place .
coach horst köppel was satisfied with the first-half performance but admitted that after a dodgy second-half the victory was " fortunate . "
leverkusen disappoints again the freefall for bayer leverkusen continued with a disappointing 1-1 against lowly bielefeld .
it could just as easily have been a loss for leverkusen , as the fans at the bayarena began calling for the head of team president wolfgang holzhäuser .
club supporters , accustomed to more success , watched their side crash out of the uefa cup on thursday and were then let down as only an 84th minute goal by andriy voronin saved the team from a humiliating defeat .
" it is absurd , to have to play in the bundesliga two days after a uefa cup match .
teams that play on thursday should n't have to play again until sunday , " ranted interim trainer rudi völler after the match .
schalke , one of two teams without a loss in the current season , managed to ooze out a 1-0 win against last-place frankfurt .
it was a victory of the hearts for ralf rangnick 's boys in an extremely mediocre match .
neverthelees , schalke have won four and drawn four matches thus far .
cologne dropping down bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's mario cantaluppi -lrb- m -rrb- was falling but his side finished on top against cologne nuremberg elevated their status from last-place after a 2-1 victory over harmless cologne .
stefan kiessling was the double goalscorer for coach wolfgang wolf , who can breathe a sigh of relief after the pressure was mounting on him to start winning .
cologne coach uwe rapolder watched an unmotivated team most of the match and warned that like nuremberg on saturday , his team may soon " be fighting for survival . "
hanover and duisburg walked away with one point each after a 1-1 draw .
duisburg can thank their keeper georg koch .
he stopped a penalty shot in the 85th minute to save the day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg jubilates after his goal against kaiserslautern a brace from raphael van der vaart helped german title challengers sv hamburg stay in touch with champions bayern munich with a 3-0 win at kaiserslautern on sunday . dutchman van der vaart 's double after 36 and 82 minutes and bosnian sergej barbarez -lrb- 50 -rrb- keep hamburg 's unbeaten record after eight games and leaves them just one point behind leaders bayern munich .
kaiserslatuern drop one place to 13th after their fifth loss of the season .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle .
-lrb- sept .
24 , 2005 -rrb- the 2005/2006 bundesliga season the winners and losers may seems easy to keep straight for the moment , but as more goals are shot some teams are sure to stumble while others take their place in the limelight .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics .

merkel said .

one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .

" if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one . " trial a crucial test nonetheless , the trial was seen as a crucial test of spain 's way of fighting international terrorism through legal means . it 's a strategy supported by other european countries such as germany and france and involves long police investigations and intelligence gathering followed by the arrest of suspects and a trial . the methods stand in sharp contrast to the more aggressive policy followed by the united states that tends to rely on wars , military prisons and , where necessary , military rather than civil courts . fighting terrorism via the courts the stark difference in the two approaches means many observers were looking to the madrid trial to see whether the european approach was adequate in the face of global terrorism . bildunterschrift : juan aviles , a history professor and terrorism specialist at madrid 's open university said he was hopeful . " i think that this trial is a good hope of fighting international terrorism inside the law , " aviles said . " i am optimistic about this .

" it 's regrettable and unfair and it 's a sad day for al jazeera people and i think that it should be considered as a sad day for all journalists around the world , " sheik said . civil liberties under threat experts say that the trial also graphically demonstrated the potential threat to civil liberties - a problem that democratic societies invariably face when they fight international terrorism . bildunterschrift : " it raises questions about freedom of expression and questions will continue to be raised i think about some of the evidence that was used to obtain this conviction , " said analyst charles powell . it 's uncertain what sort of example this trial has set for the future . some experts like juan aviles are happy with the sentences and not concerned that only one of the suspects was actually linked to the sept .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage .

" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .

the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .
wolfgang huber , head of the evangelical church in germany , calls soccer " a vital part of life . "
germany 's second major church also on the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister hans-georg ulrichs is the point man for activities between the evangelical church and the world cup while most german players do n't wear their faith on their sleeves during a match , those from catholic countries such as in south america , but also southern europe , make a sign of the cross or kiss a cross before a game , after a goal , or before a penalty kick .
together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .
" the end of the tournament will also see a themed communal event in berlin organized by the two major churches .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .

this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .

four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " said bayern president franz beckenbauer , who after all , ended his playing career in germany not in bayern red , but in hamburg blue . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

13 , 2005 -rrb- bayern dominance creates boringliga even after a loss to hamburg , the shine on bayern munich 's record has hardly been smudged .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .
bildunterschrift : the foot of god takes on olli kahn but if a little more serenity is required , fans need only make their way to one of 16,000 churches or parish halls in germany .
the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .
wolfgang huber , head of the evangelical church in germany , calls soccer " a vital part of life . "
germany 's second major church also on the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister hans-georg ulrichs is the point man for activities between the evangelical church and the world cup while most german players do n't wear their faith on their sleeves during a match , those from catholic countries such as in south america , but also southern europe , make a sign of the cross or kiss a cross before a game , after a goal , or before a penalty kick .
together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .
" the end of the tournament will also see a themed communal event in berlin organized by the two major churches .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said . " by finding new , high-quality opportunities to reuse these materials we are showing that we care about the environment , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de picking designer homes off the rack the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .

schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " said bayern president franz beckenbauer , who after all , ended his playing career in germany not in bayern red , but in hamburg blue . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .

schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .
bildunterschrift : the foot of god takes on olli kahn but if a little more serenity is required , fans need only make their way to one of 16,000 churches or parish halls in germany .
the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .
wolfgang huber , head of the evangelical church in germany , calls soccer " a vital part of life . "

together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one . " trial a crucial test nonetheless , the trial was seen as a crucial test of spain 's way of fighting international terrorism through legal means . it 's a strategy supported by other european countries such as germany and france and involves long police investigations and intelligence gathering followed by the arrest of suspects and a trial . the methods stand in sharp contrast to the more aggressive policy followed by the united states that tends to rely on wars , military prisons and , where necessary , military rather than civil courts . fighting terrorism via the courts the stark difference in the two approaches means many observers were looking to the madrid trial to see whether the european approach was adequate in the face of global terrorism . bildunterschrift : juan aviles , a history professor and terrorism specialist at madrid 's open university said he was hopeful .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one . " trial a crucial test nonetheless , the trial was seen as a crucial test of spain 's way of fighting international terrorism through legal means . it 's a strategy supported by other european countries such as germany and france and involves long police investigations and intelligence gathering followed by the arrest of suspects and a trial . the methods stand in sharp contrast to the more aggressive policy followed by the united states that tends to rely on wars , military prisons and , where necessary , military rather than civil courts . fighting terrorism via the courts the stark difference in the two approaches means many observers were looking to the madrid trial to see whether the european approach was adequate in the face of global terrorism . bildunterschrift : juan aviles , a history professor and terrorism specialist at madrid 's open university said he was hopeful . " i think that this trial is a good hope of fighting international terrorism inside the law , " aviles said . " i am optimistic about this . " " regrettable and unfair " but defense lawyers complained bitterly about the way monday 's trial was conducted and the evidence that was admitted into court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the case of tayssir alouni -lrb- photo -rrb- , the al jazeera correspondent who interviewed osama bin laden , the judges were convinced , on the basis of phone conversations and records of meetings , that alouni did use his position as a journalist to help al qaeda . human rights groups too have been closely watching the trial , along with members of al jazeera . al jazeerah 's editor in chief , ahmad sheik , was devastated when alouni received a sentence of seven years in prison .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .

" if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .

the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .

league leaders munich did the minimum to win against wolfsburg , and hamburg kept on munich 's heels with a win against kaiserslautern . werder bremen scored twice in the last five minutes to beat hertha berlin 2-1 in what was a thrilling match for second-place in the bundesliga .
the goals came about after berlin had wasted much of their energy trying to put more distance between themselves and the 2003-04 champions .
pal dardai had put the hosts on top in front of 64,629 jubilant fans in the 48th minute after a marko pantelic shot hit the left post .
dardai was the man on the spot and hammered the rebound home .
pantelic would later be denied a goal after the referee assistant mistakenly called him offside .
referee lutz wagner would later receive the wrath of berlin supporters and the team staff for not calling a penalty after a foul on yildiray bastürk inside the bremen penalty box in the 60th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho and bremen 's christian schulz fly through the air with the greatest of ease berlin sought to put the final nail in the bremen coffin but instead , sapped of their strength , they would find themselves under intense bremen pressure .
tim borowski launched a rocket in the 85th minute that berlin keeper christian fiedler had no chance at stopping .
then , in the 89th minute , nelson valdez headed home the winner for bremen .
" that was really a top-class game .
unfortunately the referee could n't perform at the same level , " team manager dieter hoeness remarked after the game .
munich unscathed at home the new allianz arena remained pure from the perspective of the bayern munich goalkeepers after coach felix magath 's side did what was necessary to secure a 2-0 victory over wolfsburg .
starting keeper oliver kahn was held from the match after injuring his shoulder , so oldie bernd dreher was given the nod .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.10.2005 hamburg the new challengers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart -lrb- white -rrb- has revived hamburg this season the streak was brought to an end .
hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .

schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war .

league leaders munich did the minimum to win against wolfsburg , and hamburg kept on munich 's heels with a win against kaiserslautern . werder bremen scored twice in the last five minutes to beat hertha berlin 2-1 in what was a thrilling match for second-place in the bundesliga .
the goals came about after berlin had wasted much of their energy trying to put more distance between themselves and the 2003-04 champions .
pal dardai had put the hosts on top in front of 64,629 jubilant fans in the 48th minute after a marko pantelic shot hit the left post .
dardai was the man on the spot and hammered the rebound home .
pantelic would later be denied a goal after the referee assistant mistakenly called him offside .
referee lutz wagner would later receive the wrath of berlin supporters and the team staff for not calling a penalty after a foul on yildiray bastürk inside the bremen penalty box in the 60th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho and bremen 's christian schulz fly through the air with the greatest of ease berlin sought to put the final nail in the bremen coffin but instead , sapped of their strength , they would find themselves under intense bremen pressure .
tim borowski launched a rocket in the 85th minute that berlin keeper christian fiedler had no chance at stopping .
then , in the 89th minute , nelson valdez headed home the winner for bremen .
" that was really a top-class game .
unfortunately the referee could n't perform at the same level , " team manager dieter hoeness remarked after the game .
munich unscathed at home the new allianz arena remained pure from the perspective of the bayern munich goalkeepers after coach felix magath 's side did what was necessary to secure a 2-0 victory over wolfsburg .
starting keeper oliver kahn was held from the match after injuring his shoulder , so oldie bernd dreher was given the nod .
he kept the net clean - no opponent has yet scored at the arena - against the wolves who seldom created top-notch opportunities .
roque santa cruz and lucio provided the goals for bayern .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's ze antonio - first goal in the bundesliga gives his side the win borussia mönchengladbach , who finished last season just above the relegation zone , are making a move towards the top third of the table , beating mainz 1-0 at home , their third victory in a row .
ze antonio scored the lone goal in the 32nd minute and gladbach now rest in sixth place .
coach horst köppel was satisfied with the first-half performance but admitted that after a dodgy second-half the victory was " fortunate . "
leverkusen disappoints again the freefall for bayer leverkusen continued with a disappointing 1-1 against lowly bielefeld .
it could just as easily have been a loss for leverkusen , as the fans at the bayarena began calling for the head of team president wolfgang holzhäuser .
club supporters , accustomed to more success , watched their side crash out of the uefa cup on thursday and were then let down as only an 84th minute goal by andriy voronin saved the team from a humiliating defeat .
" it is absurd , to have to play in the bundesliga two days after a uefa cup match .
teams that play on thursday should n't have to play again until sunday , " ranted interim trainer rudi völler after the match .
schalke , one of two teams without a loss in the current season , managed to ooze out a 1-0 win against last-place frankfurt .
it was a victory of the hearts for ralf rangnick 's boys in an extremely mediocre match .
neverthelees , schalke have won four and drawn four matches thus far .
cologne dropping down bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's mario cantaluppi -lrb- m -rrb- was falling but his side finished on top against cologne nuremberg elevated their status from last-place after a 2-1 victory over harmless cologne .
stefan kiessling was the double goalscorer for coach wolfgang wolf , who can breathe a sigh of relief after the pressure was mounting on him to start winning .
cologne coach uwe rapolder watched an unmotivated team most of the match and warned that like nuremberg on saturday , his team may soon " be fighting for survival . "
hanover and duisburg walked away with one point each after a 1-1 draw .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .

the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2005 german parties disagree on turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is in favor of integrating turkey in the eu with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties . some see it as an opportunity , others as a threat .
when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states . " if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states . " if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .

" if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .

they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .

in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .

four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .

this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "

league leaders munich did the minimum to win against wolfsburg , and hamburg kept on munich 's heels with a win against kaiserslautern . werder bremen scored twice in the last five minutes to beat hertha berlin 2-1 in what was a thrilling match for second-place in the bundesliga .
the goals came about after berlin had wasted much of their energy trying to put more distance between themselves and the 2003-04 champions .
pal dardai had put the hosts on top in front of 64,629 jubilant fans in the 48th minute after a marko pantelic shot hit the left post .
dardai was the man on the spot and hammered the rebound home .
pantelic would later be denied a goal after the referee assistant mistakenly called him offside .
referee lutz wagner would later receive the wrath of berlin supporters and the team staff for not calling a penalty after a foul on yildiray bastürk inside the bremen penalty box in the 60th minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho and bremen 's christian schulz fly through the air with the greatest of ease berlin sought to put the final nail in the bremen coffin but instead , sapped of their strength , they would find themselves under intense bremen pressure .
tim borowski launched a rocket in the 85th minute that berlin keeper christian fiedler had no chance at stopping .
then , in the 89th minute , nelson valdez headed home the winner for bremen .
" that was really a top-class game .
unfortunately the referee could n't perform at the same level , " team manager dieter hoeness remarked after the game .
munich unscathed at home the new allianz arena remained pure from the perspective of the bayern munich goalkeepers after coach felix magath 's side did what was necessary to secure a 2-0 victory over wolfsburg .
starting keeper oliver kahn was held from the match after injuring his shoulder , so oldie bernd dreher was given the nod .
he kept the net clean - no opponent has yet scored at the arena - against the wolves who seldom created top-notch opportunities .
roque santa cruz and lucio provided the goals for bayern .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gladbach 's ze antonio - first goal in the bundesliga gives his side the win borussia mönchengladbach , who finished last season just above the relegation zone , are making a move towards the top third of the table , beating mainz 1-0 at home , their third victory in a row .
ze antonio scored the lone goal in the 32nd minute and gladbach now rest in sixth place .
coach horst köppel was satisfied with the first-half performance but admitted that after a dodgy second-half the victory was " fortunate . "
leverkusen disappoints again the freefall for bayer leverkusen continued with a disappointing 1-1 against lowly bielefeld .
it could just as easily have been a loss for leverkusen , as the fans at the bayarena began calling for the head of team president wolfgang holzhäuser .
club supporters , accustomed to more success , watched their side crash out of the uefa cup on thursday and were then let down as only an 84th minute goal by andriy voronin saved the team from a humiliating defeat .
" it is absurd , to have to play in the bundesliga two days after a uefa cup match .
teams that play on thursday should n't have to play again until sunday , " ranted interim trainer rudi völler after the match .
schalke , one of two teams without a loss in the current season , managed to ooze out a 1-0 win against last-place frankfurt .
it was a victory of the hearts for ralf rangnick 's boys in an extremely mediocre match .
neverthelees , schalke have won four and drawn four matches thus far .
cologne dropping down bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's mario cantaluppi -lrb- m -rrb- was falling but his side finished on top against cologne nuremberg elevated their status from last-place after a 2-1 victory over harmless cologne .
stefan kiessling was the double goalscorer for coach wolfgang wolf , who can breathe a sigh of relief after the pressure was mounting on him to start winning .
cologne coach uwe rapolder watched an unmotivated team most of the match and warned that like nuremberg on saturday , his team may soon " be fighting for survival . "
hanover and duisburg walked away with one point each after a 1-1 draw .
duisburg can thank their keeper georg koch .
he stopped a penalty shot in the 85th minute to save the day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg jubilates after his goal against kaiserslautern a brace from raphael van der vaart helped german title challengers sv hamburg stay in touch with champions bayern munich with a 3-0 win at kaiserslautern on sunday . dutchman van der vaart 's double after 36 and 82 minutes and bosnian sergej barbarez -lrb- 50 -rrb- keep hamburg 's unbeaten record after eight games and leaves them just one point behind leaders bayern munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2005 terrorist trial sets doubtful precedent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial has been called unfair by some critics europe 's biggest trial of a suspected al qaeda cell ended this week with 18 of 24 defendants being convicted for collaborating with a terrorist group .
but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one . " trial a crucial test nonetheless , the trial was seen as a crucial test of spain 's way of fighting international terrorism through legal means . it 's a strategy supported by other european countries such as germany and france and involves long police investigations and intelligence gathering followed by the arrest of suspects and a trial . the methods stand in sharp contrast to the more aggressive policy followed by the united states that tends to rely on wars , military prisons and , where necessary , military rather than civil courts . fighting terrorism via the courts the stark difference in the two approaches means many observers were looking to the madrid trial to see whether the european approach was adequate in the face of global terrorism . bildunterschrift : juan aviles , a history professor and terrorism specialist at madrid 's open university said he was hopeful . " i think that this trial is a good hope of fighting international terrorism inside the law , " aviles said . " i am optimistic about this . " " regrettable and unfair " but defense lawyers complained bitterly about the way monday 's trial was conducted and the evidence that was admitted into court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the case of tayssir alouni -lrb- photo -rrb- , the al jazeera correspondent who interviewed osama bin laden , the judges were convinced , on the basis of phone conversations and records of meetings , that alouni did use his position as a journalist to help al qaeda . human rights groups too have been closely watching the trial , along with members of al jazeera . al jazeerah 's editor in chief , ahmad sheik , was devastated when alouni received a sentence of seven years in prison . " it 's regrettable and unfair and it 's a sad day for al jazeera people and i think that it should be considered as a sad day for all journalists around the world , " sheik said . civil liberties under threat experts say that the trial also graphically demonstrated the potential threat to civil liberties - a problem that democratic societies invariably face when they fight international terrorism . bildunterschrift : " it raises questions about freedom of expression and questions will continue to be raised i think about some of the evidence that was used to obtain this conviction , " said analyst charles powell . it 's uncertain what sort of example this trial has set for the future . some experts like juan aviles are happy with the sentences and not concerned that only one of the suspects was actually linked to the sept .
11 attacks . but for others , lingering questions remain about the evidence used to achieve convictions and the enormous gap between the prosecution 's charges for the top suspects , and the sentences the defendants actually received . danny wood -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain convicts sept .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states . " if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .
-lrb- sept .
29 , 2005 -rrb- turkey threatens to skip eu entry talks turkish foreign minister abdullah gül said the eu was putting up conditions turkey could never accept and threatened not to show up for talks with the eu after austria blocked an accord to start entry negotiations .
-lrb- sept .
30 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : eu-turkey project hardly realistic negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form .

" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty .

she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .

the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .

despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .

the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .

together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2005 german parties disagree on turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is in favor of integrating turkey in the eu with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties . some see it as an opportunity , others as a threat .
when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states . " if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .
bildunterschrift : the foot of god takes on olli kahn but if a little more serenity is required , fans need only make their way to one of 16,000 churches or parish halls in germany .
the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .
wolfgang huber , head of the evangelical church in germany , calls soccer " a vital part of life . "

together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .

but what sort of example has it set for similar cases in the future ? on monday this week , spain 's highest court convicted 18 of the 24 defendants in europe 's biggest trial of suspected islamist militants .
most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send . " i think prosecutors have found that the al qaeda phenomenon is a very slippery one .
in other words , it 's very difficult to prove that these people received orders from abroad telling them what to do , " powell said . " the chain of command is a very elusive one . " trial a crucial test nonetheless , the trial was seen as a crucial test of spain 's way of fighting international terrorism through legal means . it 's a strategy supported by other european countries such as germany and france and involves long police investigations and intelligence gathering followed by the arrest of suspects and a trial . the methods stand in sharp contrast to the more aggressive policy followed by the united states that tends to rely on wars , military prisons and , where necessary , military rather than civil courts . fighting terrorism via the courts the stark difference in the two approaches means many observers were looking to the madrid trial to see whether the european approach was adequate in the face of global terrorism . bildunterschrift : juan aviles , a history professor and terrorism specialist at madrid 's open university said he was hopeful . " i think that this trial is a good hope of fighting international terrorism inside the law , " aviles said . " i am optimistic about this . " " regrettable and unfair " but defense lawyers complained bitterly about the way monday 's trial was conducted and the evidence that was admitted into court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the case of tayssir alouni -lrb- photo -rrb- , the al jazeera correspondent who interviewed osama bin laden , the judges were convinced , on the basis of phone conversations and records of meetings , that alouni did use his position as a journalist to help al qaeda . human rights groups too have been closely watching the trial , along with members of al jazeera . al jazeerah 's editor in chief , ahmad sheik , was devastated when alouni received a sentence of seven years in prison . " it 's regrettable and unfair and it 's a sad day for al jazeera people and i think that it should be considered as a sad day for all journalists around the world , " sheik said . civil liberties under threat experts say that the trial also graphically demonstrated the potential threat to civil liberties - a problem that democratic societies invariably face when they fight international terrorism . bildunterschrift : " it raises questions about freedom of expression and questions will continue to be raised i think about some of the evidence that was used to obtain this conviction , " said analyst charles powell . it 's uncertain what sort of example this trial has set for the future . some experts like juan aviles are happy with the sentences and not concerned that only one of the suspects was actually linked to the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.10.2005 hamburg the new challengers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart -lrb- white -rrb- has revived hamburg this season the streak was brought to an end .
hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " said bayern president franz beckenbauer , who after all , ended his playing career in germany not in bayern red , but in hamburg blue . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .
-lrb- sept .
13 , 2005 -rrb- bayern dominance creates boringliga even after a loss to hamburg , the shine on bayern munich 's record has hardly been smudged .
munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle .
-lrb- sept .
24 , 2005 -rrb- the 2005/2006 bundesliga season the winners and losers may seems easy to keep straight for the moment , but as more goals are shot some teams are sure to stumble while others take their place in the limelight .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .

most of them belonged to or collaborated with the al qaeda terrorist network . spain 's public prosecutor pedro rubira wanted europe 's biggest ever trial of al qaeda suspects to set a strong precedent . rubira and his legal team were demanding multiple life sentences for the top three suspects , charging them with murder for supporting the masterminds of the sept.11 , 2001 attacks . instead , one of the top suspects , abrash ghalyoun , has been set free , another , dris chebli , has received six years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the top suspect , barakat yarkas -lrb- photo -rrb- , who according to the authorities was the leader of al qaeda in spain , was sentenced to 27 years , but was cleared of murder . charles powell , a political analyst with the elcano institute in madrid said this is not the strong message spain 's authorities were hoping to send .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.10.2005 hamburg the new challengers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafael van der vaart -lrb- white -rrb- has revived hamburg this season the streak was brought to an end .
hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " said bayern president franz beckenbauer , who after all , ended his playing career in germany not in bayern red , but in hamburg blue . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle .

24 , 2005 -rrb- the 2005/2006 bundesliga season the winners and losers may seems easy to keep straight for the moment , but as more goals are shot some teams are sure to stumble while others take their place in the limelight .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " said bayern president franz beckenbauer , who after all , ended his playing career in germany not in bayern red , but in hamburg blue . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2005 german parties disagree on turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder is in favor of integrating turkey in the eu with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties . some see it as an opportunity , others as a threat .
when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states . " if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

hamburg stopped defending league champs bayern munich 's 15 game string and saved the bundesliga from a runaway and utter boredom .
thomas doll 's side is a serious threat . the last major title for once-proud hamburg was the german cup in 1987 .
in the 1970 's and 80 's , they were on everybody 's list as a possible bundesliga champion .
in 1983 , they were even the best team in europe , taking home the champions clubs ' cup , the predecessor to the champions league .
if you look at their performance in the 1990 's and over the past five years , it 's peppered with mediocrity .
a third-place finish in the 1999-2000 campaign was the best result .
then came a disastrous start last season .
a year ago , the team was wallowing in the cellar , wondering if they would hit their head on a large beam and be knocked down to the second division - something that had never happened in club history .
the club 's management did what is normal - they sacked the coach .
klaus toppmöller was given his marching order .
thomas doll , the team 's amateur trainer , came in to stop the bleeding .
turnaround comes quickly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian striker mehdi mahdavikia has awakened from his slumber this season with hamburg seven match days later , the northern germans rested in eighth place .
they would move higher , but dropped back down into that spot in the table .
this season , the early season agony has been avoided .
with the youthful attitude , the effervescence of thomas doll , the players have stormed to second place in the standings .
the highlight of the young campaign was the clear 2-0 victory over their bitter rivals bayern munich .
" hamburg celebrated like they had already won the championship , " said munich keeper oliver kahn .
considering how the team celebrated after the match - furious dancing on the field included - it 's no wonder that kahn was a little irritated .
the intensity that kahn is so well-known for is not one of doll 's attributes . the hamburg coach has been following the tenets of buddhism for some five years .
" i believe that the most important thing is to keep an even-keel , " doll told the magazine sport-bild .
" whoever is kind to others , will be paid in kind with kindness . "
an unusual philosophy , no matter what sport you play .
new challengers to keep up the rally that started when doll entered the scene last season , the players have to perform so that their ambition of international competition on a consistent basis can be reached .
players like mehdi mahdivikia and benjamin lauth have improved up front .
in back , daniel van buyten is solid as usual .
bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer -lrb- l -rrb- ended his german soccer career with hamburg most importantly so far is that the surprise acquisition of young dutch star midfielder rafael van der vaart has paid off in spades .
four goals and two assists have helped hamburg preserve an unbeaten record in seven bundesliga matches , albeit they have two draws to their record .
kahn 's comments after the 2-0 defeat were music to the ears of hamburg sporting director dietmar beiersdorfer .
" the fact that kahn said we celebrated like we won the title tells me bayern are taking us seriously , " he commented .
" hamburg are now bayern 's main competitors for the title , " said bayern president franz beckenbauer , who after all , ended his playing career in germany not in bayern red , but in hamburg blue . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

13 , 2005 -rrb- bayern dominance creates boringliga even after a loss to hamburg , the shine on bayern munich 's record has hardly been smudged .
munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle .

the concrete slabs they are made from are high quality products that could serve for another 80 years , he said . " there is a lot to be said for reusing the slabs , " stolpe told die welt newspaper .
" they could come back in a completely new and modern form . " news house has more style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these plain , old german apartments could become new , attractive russian apartments one such form could be new , hopefully more attractively designed , apartment buildings for russians in st. petersburg , which is currently suffering from a housing shortage . " the individual slabs remain nearly undamaged after being taken down , " engineer frank vogdt of the technical university in berlin told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
" afterwards no one would ever know they came from a prefabricated building . " to prove that the buildings that used to house hundreds of working-class east germans could be used to make single family homes , the german government built a gabled-roof prototype home outside of berlin from the used concrete .
according to stolpe , reusing the communist relics can save companies up to 30 percent in construction costs . the house in berlin , along with the cheaper manufacturing costs , piqued the interest of a russian delegation representing companies that want to use the slabs in new housing projects . " i run a private business and for me it 's about the price , " russian businessman igor fjodorow told the süddeutsche zeitung . coastal buildings popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tearing the buildings down is expensive for germany researches calculated that the energy savings that result from not having to produce new concrete would be enough to heat a one-family house for nearly 10 years .
the transportation costs for the massive pieces of concrete , however , can run high . that 's why fjodorow and his countrymen are mostly interested in the multitude of prefabricated apartment buildings located near the baltic sea , where they can be loaded onto a boat and shipped to st. petersburg , which currently needs about 100,000 apartments , fjodorow estimated . while the deal seems to be good both for the german government , which wants to get rid of the often unused and deteriorating building , and the russian companies looking to make a profit building homes , stolpe said the two groups have n't signed any deals yet . the concrete is currently used in german road construction projects , for which it first must be broken into smaller , more manageable pieces .
finding a way to take advantage of the material while still whole would save money and help the environment , stolpe said . " by finding new , high-quality opportunities to reuse these materials we are showing that we care about the environment , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de picking designer homes off the rack the tarnished image of prefabricated housing may be getting a shine in germany , with a rash of ultra-modern designs on the market .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .
bildunterschrift : the foot of god takes on olli kahn but if a little more serenity is required , fans need only make their way to one of 16,000 churches or parish halls in germany .
the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .
wolfgang huber , head of the evangelical church in germany , calls soccer " a vital part of life . "
germany 's second major church also on the ball bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister hans-georg ulrichs is the point man for activities between the evangelical church and the world cup while most german players do n't wear their faith on their sleeves during a match , those from catholic countries such as in south america , but also southern europe , make a sign of the cross or kiss a cross before a game , after a goal , or before a penalty kick .
together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .
" the end of the tournament will also see a themed communal event in berlin organized by the two major churches .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty .

she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .

" if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .
germany 's turkish islamist union called on 20,000 supporters to attend .
the introduction of new laws in turkey alone is not enough , said leading greens politician claudia roth .
" on paper , some really important legal measures have been passed , but now we have to ensure that they are put into practice , especially when it comes to the ' no tolerance ' policy on torture and abuse , " she said .
the door to the eu will only remain open as long as turkey continues to pursue its reforms and fulfil the criteria set out by brussels - one point that all the german parties can agree on . turkey and a grand coalition the cdu may have failed in its appeal to brussels to guarantee that its notion of a privileged partnership would be a potential outcome of the negotiations , but it is holding firm to its concept nonetheless .
that 's why , in a possible grand coalition with the spd , turkey 's eu accession will continue to pop up on the government 's agenda - at the very latest , when the first difficulties in the negotiations emerge . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to discuss membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

when it comes to the topic of turkey 's eu candidacy , the positions of germany 's main parties vary greatly .
on one side of the debate are the social democrats and the greens , who have lobbied in favor of turkey joining the eu throughout their past seven years as germany 's ruling coalition .
the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , on the other hand , would rather not even see ankara approach the negotiating table . schröder : 10 to 15 years in his last address on european policy before the bundestag , chancellor gerhard schröder appealed once again to the skeptics . " negotiations on turkey 's entry will take between 10 and 15 years , " schröder said .
" the negotiation concept provides for the possibility of limiting labor migration to zero .
it allows for either side to call a moratorium or break off the talks at any time .
that makes it an appropriate instrument to achieve the goal , without placing any eu country , including germany , in undue difficulty . " merkel : europe ca n't take it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader angela merkel during a visit to istanbul in february 2004 but difficulties for germany and for the entire european union are exactly what cdu leader angela merkel fears , should turkey be admitted .
she has repeatedly rejected the goal of full membership for turkey , and has made that part of her election platform . " we base our position first and foremost on the question , what can the eu afford to do given its present composition ? "
merkel said .
" we 're currently 25 members , and we 're taking on two more members with romania and bulgaria .
one of the central questions is whether the eu 's ability to integrate new members will suffer .
i do n't think europe can take it right now , and that 's why we 're in favor of a privileged partnership . " bordering on asia the csu 's european policy expert , gerd müller , said that the parallel strategies of both deepening and expanding the eu are a grand deception .
" you ca n't force political union with a european constitution , transfer considerable amounts of national responsibility to the central authorities in brussels , and at the same time extend european borders all the way to anatolia , to central asia , " he said . added security ? but that 's exactly the geopolitical strategy that the greens and social democrats think is the right strategy to make europe safer - a position that schröder has been promoting ever more in the aftermath of the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states . " if , in turkey , we can successfully bind a non-fundamentalist islamic state with the values of the west , then we will have increased the security of germany and europe immeasurably , " schröder said . the spd and greens are aware , however , that turkey is not yet ready for membership , despite the efforts of the turkish government to introduce reforms . greens : stopping torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian interior minister günther beckstein -lrb- r -rrb- , greens leader claudia roth -lrb- l -rrb- and the federal commissioner for foreigners in germany , marie-luise beck at an anti-terror demo in cologne in november 2004 .

18 , in dresden , the candidates swung back into full campaign mode on friday , vying for advantage in the late-voting district . chancellor gerhard schröder and conservative leader angela merkel delivered their now familiar messages on the stump in dresden .
they each claimed to have won a mandate in the elections , and they each insisted that the other was unfit to lead the country . schröder draws more supporters both camps held their rallies at the same time , just 3 km -lrb- 2 miles -rrb- apart .
schröder 's camp , however , drew five times as many supporters as merkel 's .
he was loudly cheered by an estimated 5,000-strong crowd when he accused merkel of lacking the strength to stand up for peace if " powerful world leaders " were to try to pressure germany into war . " it 's not just enough to have the will , it 's a question if she 's able to stand up to a powerful partner , " schröder said .
" she has n't and that 's why she 's not capable of leading germany . schröder largely secured his 2002 victory by refusing to join the us-led coalition in the war on iraq .
his peace stance is a strong advantage for him in the formerly communist east . merkel claims victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel speaking in dresden merkel was equally aggressive as she spoke to a crowd of around 900 people , pointing to the fact that her party won more votes in the sept .
18 election . " the spd-greens government has been voted out of power , " merkel said .
" that 's already known before the dresden election .
when the polls have closed in dresden , i am sure that the chancellor will slowly see that too . " both sides spoke of the importance of the dresden vote , as though it could be the decisive factor to end the current election chaos .
but for days now , analysts in berlin have played down the significance of the late vote , saying it wo n't fundamentally change anything . sunday 's results are not likely to determine which candidate will win the protracted battle for the chancellorship .
though leading conservative politicians have upped pressure on schröder to step aside , the spd leadership has strongly refuted rumors that schröder is planning to throw in the towel on monday . currently , the conservative alliance of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- hold a three-seat advantage over schröder 's spd .
while schröder has virtually no chance of eliminating the three-seat gap , germany 's voting system means he could gain a seat or two , strengthening his hand in the negotiations with merkel that insiders are predicting will lead to a grand coalition . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german poll reaches finale in dresden german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election .

so it 's fitting that the world cup opening ceremonies will be staged by the director of the passion play .
and , that fans can settle into a pew to watch the matches . for many players and supporters alike , soccer is a religion .
world cup organizers fifa have not overlooked this , and the world soccer body will work closely with churches and religious organizations during the event .
for the opening ceremonies , which are , for many , just as much of a highlight as the games , fifa had an ingenious idea .
the ceremonies should be unparalleled , so the director of the mammoth oberammergau passion play , christoph stückl , has been asked to stage the celebration of soccer in munich on june 9 , when germany faces a yet to be determined opponent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passionate director : christian stückl stückl -lrb- photo -rrb- should be the right man for the job , considering that he has to manage hundreds of actors in the play that takes place once every 10 years and covers the death and resurrection of jesus christ .
in munich , over 2,000 performers will be used for the entertainment before the opening game .
despite such sparkling credentials , divine inspiration may be needed .
stückl told german television broadcaster n24 that he was startled by the assignment because he " knows nothing about soccer . "
seat in the pews instead of the stands the opening ceremonies are important for fifa , but what endures in the memories of over 2 billion soccer fans worldwide is what happens on the pitch .
some will come to germany without tickets just to experience the flair of the 64 matches .
they can go to bars to watch , and there are official fifa world cup parties in the 12 host cities .
bildunterschrift : the foot of god takes on olli kahn but if a little more serenity is required , fans need only make their way to one of 16,000 churches or parish halls in germany .
the swiss sports agency infront , which holds the tv rights to the competition , has granted one of germany 's two major churches permission to show all the final matches in june and july next summer .
" thanks to its agreement with infront , germany 's evangelical church has ensured that churches will be able to show matches on a big screen if they wish to do so , provided the necessary organization is in place , " said minister hans-georg ulrichs on the fifa world cup web site .
ulrichs , a former striker for concordia ihrhove in east frisia and currently player for the baden ministers ' xi , has support at all levels for the project that he views as an essential part to the church 's community work during the tournament .
wolfgang huber , head of the evangelical church in germany , calls soccer " a vital part of life . "

together with father hans-gerd schutt , ulrichs is looking for ways for both churches to present a message that most soccer supporters can hear .
" we are currently at an advanced stage of planning a large-scale cross-denominational service in munich at the start of the competition , " ulrichs added .

the european equal treatment directive has extended the definition of sex discrimination to cover any act that leads to intimidation or degradation .
the tuc said the changes would make employers more responsible and allow female workers a better chance of fighting against harassment .
but businesses said the law would see companies facing " legalised blackmail " .
under the new law , a colleague who persists in making remarks about a woman 's appearance could be accused of sexual harassment .
more responsibility sarah veale of the tuc told bbc five live employers had a duty to protect their staff .
" the employer is vicariously liable .
often the employer will sit back and let it go on .
" an employer should make sure that the people it employs know how to behave and if they 're causing offence to others then they should do something about it , " she said .
in a separate statement , tuc general secretary brendan barber added : " today 's change will force employers to take their responsibilities towards providing a harassment-free working environment more seriously .
" there 's no place in the modern workplace for office gropers and lechers and bosses need to do more to stop those responsible for bad behaviour from making working life unbearable for thousands of women . "
' compensation culture ' but rex garratt , spokesman for the forum of private business , which represents more than 25,000 small to medium sized firms , said the changes were too heavily in favour of employees .
" employers will view these changes to tribunals with a sense of utter dread .
" tribunals are already bleeding businesses dry because they are so heavily loaded in favour of employees .
" businesses face legalised blackmail as the costs of defending a case deny them justice from vexatious ex-employees on the make , supported by ambulance-chasing advisers who encourage doubtful claims . "
he added private businesses had become a " prime target for the compensation culture " .
" this compensation culture has seen a doubling in the amount of compensation awarded in 2004 in the key areas of sex , disability and racial discrimination . "
a spokeswoman for the department of trade and industry said the employment equality -lrb- sex discrimination -rrb- regulations 2005 amend the law to " make explicit the fact that discrimination on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity leave and sexual harassment and harassment on the grounds of sex are unlawful .
" we also took the opportunity to amend the sex discrimination act , so that it is in line , as far as possible , with other legislation tackling discrimination on the grounds of race , disability , religion or belief and sexual orientation in the fields of employment and vocational training , " she said .

two other people have so far taken a holiday on the station : fellow american dennis tito in 2001 , and south african mark shuttleworth in 2002 .
" i 'll be most relaxed and happy after the rocket takes off , " mr olsen said at kazakhstan 's baikonur cosmodrome ahead of the launch .

the same will be true with spaceflight - there will be more tourists after me , " he was quoted as saying by the associated press .
' flight participant ' he was joined in his soyuz capsule by commander william mcarthur from the us , and russian flight engineer valery tokarev , who make up the 12th international space station crew .
the rocket entered orbit nine minutes after take-off , having shed three booster segments on schedule .

" the term ' tourist ' does n't do justice to all the work i 've put in , or the work that the people at the gagarin centre -lrb- outside moscow -rrb- put in preparing us , " mr olsen said .

the price hike , which is significantly higher than expected , is designed to cut indonesia 's massive fuel subsidy bill and help balance its budget .
president susilo bambang yudhoyono urged people to stay calm , as mobs burnt tyres and effigies in protest .
police reportedly fired tear gas at about 200 students in jakarta who were throwing stones and burning tyres .
the new prices came into effect at midnight local time -lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- , shortly after they were announced by ministers .
fuel rises prices have risen by an average of 120 % overnight 1 litre unleaded petrol rises from 2,450 rupiah -lrb- 24 us cents -rrb- to 4,500 -lrb- 44 us cents -rrb- 1 litre kerosene climbs from 700 rp -lrb- 7 cents -rrb- to 2,000 -lrb- 20 cents -rrb- government spending third of budget on fuel subsidies , due to weak rp and high global prices some 15m poorer families will each get 300,000 rp -lrb- $ 30 -rrb- in compensation oil price hikes contributed to fall of president suharto in ' 98 in pictures : fuel protests press dismay at hike a litre of kerosene , used by millions of indonesians for cooking , will now cost 20 us cents - an increase of 186 % .
the price of petrol will also shoot up by 87.5 % .
the increases will have a knock-on effect on the price of everything from rice to cigarettes .
the government hopes to defuse some of the protests by making direct payments to 15 million poorer families , who will be worst hit by the rise in kerosene prices .
long queues were reported outside post offices on saturday as people waited to collect their payments .
also on saturday , effigies of president yudhoyono and vice president yusuf kalla were set alight by protesters on lombok island .
the bbc 's tim johnston in jakarta says it remains to be seen if the protests that have been simmering over the past few days increase in volume and violence .
police outside a university campus in the capital fired warning shots at protesters that appeared to be blanks , el shinta radio reported on friday , and hit some of the demonstrators with sticks , according to the associated press .
the protests followed widespread demonstrations in at least eight cities on thursday .
budget crisis indonesia has some of the most generous fuel subsidies in asia , a throwback to its days as a net oil exporter .
fuel subsidies currently account for about a third of all central government spending , more than the budget for health or education .
i realise that this is not a popular policy ... but we have to do it to save the nation 's budget and the future of the country president yudhoyono but the country now has to import oil , and the sharp rise in global oil prices has threatened to overwhelm the government 's budget .
the situation is worsened by the country 's weak currency - worries about the budget position triggered a sharp drop in the rupiah last month .
the president announced the price rises last week , and parliament approved the plan on tuesday by voting to cap government spending on fuel subsidies at $ 8.7bn.
economists had estimated the effect of the cap would be to force some fuel prices up by 60 % - a much lower rise than the figure finally announced .
ministers argue that petrol price rises will be less painful , since they will mainly affect richer indonesians who drive cars .
the price rises come at a sensitive time , ahead of the muslim fasting month of ramadan .
successive indonesian governments have also been wary of cutting fuel subsidies , because a 1998 hike in fuel prices helped topple former dictator suharto .
" i realise that this is not a popular policy , " president yudhoyono said , " but we have to do it to save the nation 's budget and the future of the country " .

fuel rises prices have risen by an average of 120 % overnight 1 litre unleaded petrol rises from 2,450 rupiah -lrb- 24 us cents -rrb- to 4,500 -lrb- 44 us cents -rrb- 1 litre kerosene climbs from 700 rp -lrb- 7 cents -rrb- to 2,000 -lrb- 20 cents -rrb- government spending third of budget on fuel subsidies , due to weak rp and high global prices some 15m poorer families will each get 300,000 rp -lrb- $ 30 -rrb- in compensation oil price hikes contributed to fall of president suharto in ' 98 in pictures : fuel protests press dismay at hike a litre of kerosene , used by millions of indonesians for cooking , will now cost 20 us cents - an increase of 186 % .
the price of petrol will also shoot up by 87.5 % .
the increases will have a knock-on effect on the price of everything from rice to cigarettes .
the government hopes to defuse some of the protests by making direct payments to 15 million poorer families , who will be worst hit by the rise in kerosene prices .
long queues were reported outside post offices on saturday as people waited to collect their payments .
also on saturday , effigies of president yudhoyono and vice president yusuf kalla were set alight by protesters on lombok island .
the bbc 's tim johnston in jakarta says it remains to be seen if the protests that have been simmering over the past few days increase in volume and violence .
police outside a university campus in the capital fired warning shots at protesters that appeared to be blanks , el shinta radio reported on friday , and hit some of the demonstrators with sticks , according to the associated press .
the protests followed widespread demonstrations in at least eight cities on thursday .
budget crisis indonesia has some of the most generous fuel subsidies in asia , a throwback to its days as a net oil exporter .
fuel subsidies currently account for about a third of all central government spending , more than the budget for health or education .
i realise that this is not a popular policy ... but we have to do it to save the nation 's budget and the future of the country president yudhoyono but the country now has to import oil , and the sharp rise in global oil prices has threatened to overwhelm the government 's budget .
the situation is worsened by the country 's weak currency - worries about the budget position triggered a sharp drop in the rupiah last month .
the president announced the price rises last week , and parliament approved the plan on tuesday by voting to cap government spending on fuel subsidies at $ 8.7bn.
economists had estimated the effect of the cap would be to force some fuel prices up by 60 % - a much lower rise than the figure finally announced .
ministers argue that petrol price rises will be less painful , since they will mainly affect richer indonesians who drive cars .
the price rises come at a sensitive time , ahead of the muslim fasting month of ramadan .
successive indonesian governments have also been wary of cutting fuel subsidies , because a 1998 hike in fuel prices helped topple former dictator suharto .
" i realise that this is not a popular policy , " president yudhoyono said , " but we have to do it to save the nation 's budget and the future of the country " .

riot police backed by armoured vehicles removed the protesters who blocked the ferry ramp in the island 's main city .
strikers had cut off sea links with the french mainland , stranding hundreds of tourists and preventing deliveries .
the dispute over the privatisation of the ferry operator sncm has stoked nationalist feelings in corsica .
the seaports of ajaccio and bastia had been blocked by staff of the debt-ridden company , which the government is planning to sell .
the blockades began on wednesday , after police arrested four nationalist activists accused of hijacking an sncm ship in marseille on the mainland .
the four were released on friday , in a possible sign of appeasement by the authorities .
early on saturday , security forces moved into ajaccio harbour removing the lorries and protesters from the ferry access ramp .
no violence was reported .
" our objective is to allow free movement of traffic in the port of ajaccio , initially to allow the very large number of tourists stuck in corsica to leave , " the island 's chief administrator , pierre-rene lemas , said .
sncm has been plagued by debts , strikes and competition from private operators .
further aid from the french state is barred by european union regulations , and the company faces bankruptcy unless an outside buyer is found .
however both unions and corsican nationalist groups are fiercely opposed to a sell-off .
the dispute has fuelled tensions on the island , which has been plagued by separatist violence for three decades .
on thursday a rocket was fired at the authorities ' headquarters in ajaccio , causing damage but injuring no-one .
sympathy strikes have also disrupted air links to corsica .
protesters who had blockaded two oil terminals near marseille were also removed by security forces early on saturday .

correspondents say prime minister helen clark is now likely to form a minority government with support from a number of smaller parties .
her labour party has 50 seats in the 121-member parliament , two more than the main opposition national party .
ms clark will be the first labour prime minister to win three successive terms .
the election was held on 17 september .
initial results were issued a day later but the final tally was delayed while special votes , from those overseas or outside their home district on polling day , were counted .
tax cuts plan national party leader don brash finally conceded defeat after the result was announced .

however , it almost doubled its vote , on a platform of tax cuts , closer ties to the us and pledges to cut state aid to maori communities .
ms clark has said she would prefer to lead a minority government , seeking support from other parties for crucial legislation .
the bbc 's greg ward in auckland says the prime minister may have won a record third term but she has plenty of work ahead in forming and managing a stable government .
labour already has the support of the greens and the progressive party and can expect the backing of the indigenous maori party .
but new zealand first and united future have said they will not support the government if any greens are given cabinet posts .

former city councillor betty campbell said residents had initially welcomed investment in cardiff bay .
her comments came after a report revealed that butetown - formerly the heartland of the docks area of cardiff - was the most deprived area in wales .
but now , she said , the area was being " squeezed " on both sides by luxury apartments .
" i would say in 20 years time there wo n't be a butetown , " she said .
deprivation index top ten butetown , cardiff rhyl west 2 penrhiwceber penydarren , merthyr tydfil castle , swansea penderry , swansea townhill , swansea queensway , wrexham rhyl west 1 a new index of poverty statistics released by the welsh assembly government put the area ahead of parts of the seaside town of rhyl in north wales and the former mining town of penrhiwceiber in the cynon valley .
the 2005 welsh index of multiple deprivation is more detailed than previous studies , and there are hopes that the table of results will help the areas get the financial support they need .
the report focuses on income , housing , employment , education , health , services , and the physical environment .
it divides wales up into smaller areas than a similar study in 2000 and the assembly government said this would better help it identify pockets of deprivation .
merthyr tydfil remains the local authority with the highest proportion of the most deprived areas .
the 2005 index includes a new element , assessing the quality of people 's environment .
after the 2000 index was published , the hundred most deprived wards in wales were given extra resources .
the section of butetown at the top of the 2005 deprivation index did not figure as highly in the 2000 study , because it is right next door to the affluent cardiff bay .
' dust and dirt ' speaking to bbc radio wales , ms campbell - who has lived in butetown for 70 years - said the redevelopment of the area had worked against the community .
residents had originally supported development plans , thinking they would be part of the regeneration .
but , she added : " all we had was all the noise , dust and dirt that went on to make the area around butetown a really nice area , " she said " but inside butetown we 've had flats boarded up for 10 years and the shopping centre looks like beirut .
it 's a disaster .
" people who live in the area will have been persuaded or bribed to move to other parts of the city .
" we are now sitting on prime land and it wo n't be long before the council wants to grab that . "
fellow butetown resident james commander said he was upset by the way the area had been treated .
he said : " i was born here in 1941 , like all my family .
we had a community and everybody looked after each other .
they 've treated us like rubbish . "
social justice and regeneration minister edwina hart said dividing wales into a larger number of areas addressed one of the main criticisms of the 2000 index .
" in the larger areas , there was a possibility of pockets of deprivation being sometimes masked by a higher level of affluence in other parts of the area , " the minister said .
" the new index will give us a clearer picture across more comparative areas . "
the assembly government will now study the index in more detail before consulting on ideas to tackle the issues it raises .
