since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .

aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .

i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .

i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .

köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

" it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .
turkey has fulfilled all the conditions that were decided upon during a summit last december of eu leaders , according to eu commission spokeswoman francoise lebail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus , friday , dec .
17 , 2004 turkey cleared the last obstacle to starting entry talks by signing what is known as the ankara protocol last month , extending its customs union to new eu members including cyprus .
lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .
frances raises pressure on turkey but not everyone agrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president erdogan , left with german chancellor schröder and chirac french president jacques chirac said on monday that turkey 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus did throw up problems .
on tuesday french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy issued a new call on tuesday for turkey to recognize cyprus .
" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in turkey voices of opposition can also be heard coming from germany .
angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .
according to diplomatic sources , frantic wrangling is underway behind the scenes on the wording of the agreement .
cyprus could veto the document and even austria has signaled it has doubts .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .

"
yan li is the berlin correspondent for radio china international .
dw-world talked to him about the state of affairs in germany and the upcoming election . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
yan li : by and large i like the country very much .
people have attitude and are very cultured .
but , yes , the economy is struggling - in berlin you find unemployment rates of some 20 percent .
the other thing i noticed is that there are so few kids and young people here .
it gives you the impression that germany is quite an " old " country and lacking in vitality .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
that 's a difficult one .
germany has long been a country with high levels of social welfare provided by the state .
people have come to depend on this and live too much off the state .
a reform in the social sector is necessary .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
i do n't have a preference .
but whoever gets to govern the country needs to commit to reforms .
but maybe for schröder it 's already the end of the road .
what do you like about germany ?
for me it 's always the beer , culture and history of the place .
what do you dislike about germany ?
nothing actually .
i have not experienced any of the so called a usländerfeindlichkeit -lrb- enmity towards foreigners -rrb- .
i also have n't found germans to be cold towards foreigners as some people say . ranty islam interviewed yan li send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing old gracefully in germany according to estimates , more than a third of the german population will be over 60 by the year 2050 .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .

" a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .
turkey has fulfilled all the conditions that were decided upon during a summit last december of eu leaders , according to eu commission spokeswoman francoise lebail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus , friday , dec .
17 , 2004 turkey cleared the last obstacle to starting entry talks by signing what is known as the ankara protocol last month , extending its customs union to new eu members including cyprus .
lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .
frances raises pressure on turkey but not everyone agrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president erdogan , left with german chancellor schröder and chirac french president jacques chirac said on monday that turkey 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus did throw up problems .
on tuesday french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy issued a new call on tuesday for turkey to recognize cyprus .
" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in turkey voices of opposition can also be heard coming from germany .
angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .
according to diplomatic sources , frantic wrangling is underway behind the scenes on the wording of the agreement .
cyprus could veto the document and even austria has signaled it has doubts .
austrian eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , responsible for foreign policy , has said the eu has to be more careful in the future when it comes to promising membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's turkish delight chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .
" the proposals presented by germany , brazil , india and japan meet the requirements of efficiency and of representation of different regions , notably africa . " chirac called for the reform to be passed by the time of a un summit that is due to take place in new york from sept .
14-16 , or failing that by the end of this year . meanwhile , at a news conference following the talks with president putin in the southern russian town of sochi , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called for a pause in debate on reform of the united nations , saying several current proposals for expanding membership on the security council could alienate a large number of un member states . berlusconi wants a pause in reform discussions " we believe that there will not be wide consensus and that we should not now discuss reform which could make many countries representing entire continents unhappy , " berlusconi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , right , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " the accession of one of these countries to the un security council runs the risk of embarrassing three or four other countries , " berlusconi added . italy has been among a number of countries that have opposed a plan that would see brazil , germany , india and japan - a so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- - all admitted as permanent members of the security council . " a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .
" this can happen only if there is wide consensus and wide support for reform .

yan li is the berlin correspondent for radio china international .
dw-world talked to him about the state of affairs in germany and the upcoming election . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
yan li : by and large i like the country very much .
people have attitude and are very cultured .
but , yes , the economy is struggling - in berlin you find unemployment rates of some 20 percent .
the other thing i noticed is that there are so few kids and young people here .
it gives you the impression that germany is quite an " old " country and lacking in vitality .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
that 's a difficult one .
germany has long been a country with high levels of social welfare provided by the state .
people have come to depend on this and live too much off the state .
a reform in the social sector is necessary .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
i do n't have a preference .
but whoever gets to govern the country needs to commit to reforms .
but maybe for schröder it 's already the end of the road .
what do you like about germany ?
for me it 's always the beer , culture and history of the place .
what do you dislike about germany ?
nothing actually .
i have not experienced any of the so called a usländerfeindlichkeit -lrb- enmity towards foreigners -rrb- .
i also have n't found germans to be cold towards foreigners as some people say . ranty islam interviewed yan li send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de growing old gracefully in germany according to estimates , more than a third of the german population will be over 60 by the year 2050 .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2005 köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- with kwasniewski in warsaw on monday at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland . kicking off a three-day visit to poland on tuesday , german president horst köhler attempted to ease the fears of his hosts in warsaw regarding the controversial center which is planned as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formely german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii . " there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .
1 . köhler will be one of 20 heads of state and government gathering in gdansk to mark solidarity 's anniversary .
on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .
it 's seen as paving the way for the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the end of the post-world war ii division of the continent .
bildunterschrift : workers carry lech walesa on their shoulders on aug .
30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .
after taking office in 2004 , poland was the first country to which he paid an official visit ; normally , german presidents visit france first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aleksander kwasnieski -lrb- left -rrb- and horst köhler inaugurated the polish-german year in berlin in april .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .
" the proposals presented by germany , brazil , india and japan meet the requirements of efficiency and of representation of different regions , notably africa . " chirac called for the reform to be passed by the time of a un summit that is due to take place in new york from sept .
14-16 , or failing that by the end of this year . meanwhile , at a news conference following the talks with president putin in the southern russian town of sochi , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called for a pause in debate on reform of the united nations , saying several current proposals for expanding membership on the security council could alienate a large number of un member states . berlusconi wants a pause in reform discussions " we believe that there will not be wide consensus and that we should not now discuss reform which could make many countries representing entire continents unhappy , " berlusconi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , right , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " the accession of one of these countries to the un security council runs the risk of embarrassing three or four other countries , " berlusconi added . italy has been among a number of countries that have opposed a plan that would see brazil , germany , india and japan - a so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- - all admitted as permanent members of the security council . " a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .
" this can happen only if there is wide consensus and wide support for reform . " italy should be a permanent member , says pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian leader said that italy was the sixth largest financial contributor to the united nations and noted that 40,000 italian troops were currently serving in un peacekeeping operations around the world . " from our point of view , it 's perfectly legitimate that italy could be a member of the security council , " he said . the 15-seat security council has only five permanent members with veto powers : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , india 's foreign minister natwar singh , brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim , and japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura - the so-called group of four a proposal by the by so-called g4 - brazil , germany , india and japan - would boost council membership to 25 , with six new permanent non-veto-wielding seats - one for each of the so-called g4 members and two for africa - and four non-permanent seats . opposition may delay decision until 2006 however the g4 plan is strongly opposed by two permanent members , china and the united states , and has also failed to secure the support of the 53-nation african union . un security general kofi annan conceded earlier this month that a deal on enlargement was unlikely by the end of the year despite speculation that the question of enlarging the security council is expected to figure prominently at this year 's un general assembly next month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .
" the proposals presented by germany , brazil , india and japan meet the requirements of efficiency and of representation of different regions , notably africa . " chirac called for the reform to be passed by the time of a un summit that is due to take place in new york from sept .
14-16 , or failing that by the end of this year . meanwhile , at a news conference following the talks with president putin in the southern russian town of sochi , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called for a pause in debate on reform of the united nations , saying several current proposals for expanding membership on the security council could alienate a large number of un member states . berlusconi wants a pause in reform discussions " we believe that there will not be wide consensus and that we should not now discuss reform which could make many countries representing entire continents unhappy , " berlusconi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , right , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " the accession of one of these countries to the un security council runs the risk of embarrassing three or four other countries , " berlusconi added . italy has been among a number of countries that have opposed a plan that would see brazil , germany , india and japan - a so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- - all admitted as permanent members of the security council . " a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .
" this can happen only if there is wide consensus and wide support for reform . " italy should be a permanent member , says pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian leader said that italy was the sixth largest financial contributor to the united nations and noted that 40,000 italian troops were currently serving in un peacekeeping operations around the world . " from our point of view , it 's perfectly legitimate that italy could be a member of the security council , " he said . the 15-seat security council has only five permanent members with veto powers : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , india 's foreign minister natwar singh , brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim , and japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura - the so-called group of four a proposal by the by so-called g4 - brazil , germany , india and japan - would boost council membership to 25 , with six new permanent non-veto-wielding seats - one for each of the so-called g4 members and two for africa - and four non-permanent seats . opposition may delay decision until 2006 however the g4 plan is strongly opposed by two permanent members , china and the united states , and has also failed to secure the support of the 53-nation african union . un security general kofi annan conceded earlier this month that a deal on enlargement was unlikely by the end of the year despite speculation that the question of enlarging the security council is expected to figure prominently at this year 's un general assembly next month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .

since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .
in italy in contrast the situation feels more like five minutes after 12 , but no one cares anyway .
see that 's the point .
everything is so serious here . ranty islam interviewed aktham suliman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sept .
11 emancipated german foreign policy after sept .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .

the midair repair job came during an onur air flight from antalya in southern turkey to the eastern german city of leipzig , the bild newspaper said .
" the pilot started the engines .
suddenly a piece of the interior of the plane fell on our heads .
some of the holidaymakers started to scream , " one of the passengers , gunnar storch , 34 , told the paper .
" a female flight attendant immediately ran into the cockpit to ask for the takeoff to be aborted .
but the pilot was n't in the least bit interested .
he just carried on .
behind the interior casing , we could see the exposed wiring .
it was n't a very reassuring sight . "
the plane later landed safely in leipzig but storch said " no one was interested " when he tried to report the incident at the airport .
there was no immediate reaction to the report from either the turkish airline or airbus .
onur air was briefly banned from dutch skies in may for security reasons , with france , switzerland and germany following suit .
the four countries decided on a progressive lifting of the ban after the airline put forward a program of safety improvements . dw-world.de france compiles blacklist for airlines france has published a list of airlines that are n't allowed to fly its airspace - beating european regulators to the punch .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .

on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .

köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the foreign media 's take on germany ray furlong yan li luke harding richard bernstein election 2005 -pipe- 30.08.2005 aktham suliman großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the government 's foreign policy has kept germany a safe place " a syrian-german , aktham suliman has lived in germany for 15 years .
since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .
in italy in contrast the situation feels more like five minutes after 12 , but no one cares anyway .
see that 's the point .
everything is so serious here . ranty islam interviewed aktham suliman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sept .
11 emancipated german foreign policy after sept .
11 , berlin offered “ unlimited solidarity ” to the u.s. then it refused to support bush 's iraq war plans .
there have been errors , but the rift demonstrates the growing self-confidence of german foreign policy .
-lrb- sep .
11 , 2003 -rrb- bush , schröder say past is past during bilateral talks in mainz , schröder said germany 's disputes with the united states over iraq were in the past .
the two leaders found common ground even on divisive issues such as iran and global warming .
-lrb- feb .
24 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of unemployment angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe .

since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .
in italy in contrast the situation feels more like five minutes after 12 , but no one cares anyway .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .

17 , 2004 turkey cleared the last obstacle to starting entry talks by signing what is known as the ankara protocol last month , extending its customs union to new eu members including cyprus .
lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .
frances raises pressure on turkey but not everyone agrees .

" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union .

angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .

lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .

doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "

the midair repair job came during an onur air flight from antalya in southern turkey to the eastern german city of leipzig , the bild newspaper said .
" the pilot started the engines .
suddenly a piece of the interior of the plane fell on our heads .
some of the holidaymakers started to scream , " one of the passengers , gunnar storch , 34 , told the paper .
" a female flight attendant immediately ran into the cockpit to ask for the takeoff to be aborted .
but the pilot was n't in the least bit interested .
he just carried on .
behind the interior casing , we could see the exposed wiring .
it was n't a very reassuring sight . "
the plane later landed safely in leipzig but storch said " no one was interested " when he tried to report the incident at the airport .
there was no immediate reaction to the report from either the turkish airline or airbus .
onur air was briefly banned from dutch skies in may for security reasons , with france , switzerland and germany following suit .
the four countries decided on a progressive lifting of the ban after the airline put forward a program of safety improvements . dw-world.de france compiles blacklist for airlines france has published a list of airlines that are n't allowed to fly its airspace - beating european regulators to the punch .

the midair repair job came during an onur air flight from antalya in southern turkey to the eastern german city of leipzig , the bild newspaper said .
" the pilot started the engines .
suddenly a piece of the interior of the plane fell on our heads .
some of the holidaymakers started to scream , " one of the passengers , gunnar storch , 34 , told the paper .
" a female flight attendant immediately ran into the cockpit to ask for the takeoff to be aborted .
but the pilot was n't in the least bit interested .
he just carried on .
behind the interior casing , we could see the exposed wiring .
it was n't a very reassuring sight . "
the plane later landed safely in leipzig but storch said " no one was interested " when he tried to report the incident at the airport .
there was no immediate reaction to the report from either the turkish airline or airbus .
onur air was briefly banned from dutch skies in may for security reasons , with france , switzerland and germany following suit .
the four countries decided on a progressive lifting of the ban after the airline put forward a program of safety improvements . dw-world.de france compiles blacklist for airlines france has published a list of airlines that are n't allowed to fly its airspace - beating european regulators to the punch .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.08.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc sparks fly between government , utilities german energy giant rwe is accusing the government of using a debate about runaway electricity prices to make political capital ahead of the general elections next month , according to the business daily handelsblatt on tuesday .
environment minister jürgen trittin , for his part , rejected in an interview with the same newspaper the power utilities ' arguments for raising their electricity prices .
their argument that the price rises were largely due to trading in emission rights that was introduced at the beginning of the year was unconvincing , trittin said .
germany this year introduced a system limiting the emission of so-called greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
companies are allocated a certain volume of emission rights which are tradable .
thus , companies that emit more gas than they are allowed must buy the right to do so from other companies that have not used up all of their rights .
" emissions trading can not be the reason for the strong rise in electricity prices in recent weeks and months , " trittin said .
rwe recently claimed that it had to spend around 350 million euros -lrb- $ 427 million -rrb- annually as a result of the " tight distribution " of emission rights certificates .
in a letter to the minister , rwe chief harry roels rejected trittin 's argument .
" such simplistic finger-pointing may appear to be favourable for the current election campaign but does not stand up to the current economic and market conditions , " handelsblatt quoted roels as saying . dw-world.de germany moves to open energy market germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .

from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .

from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .
" the proposals presented by germany , brazil , india and japan meet the requirements of efficiency and of representation of different regions , notably africa . " chirac called for the reform to be passed by the time of a un summit that is due to take place in new york from sept .
14-16 , or failing that by the end of this year . meanwhile , at a news conference following the talks with president putin in the southern russian town of sochi , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called for a pause in debate on reform of the united nations , saying several current proposals for expanding membership on the security council could alienate a large number of un member states . berlusconi wants a pause in reform discussions " we believe that there will not be wide consensus and that we should not now discuss reform which could make many countries representing entire continents unhappy , " berlusconi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , right , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " the accession of one of these countries to the un security council runs the risk of embarrassing three or four other countries , " berlusconi added . italy has been among a number of countries that have opposed a plan that would see brazil , germany , india and japan - a so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- - all admitted as permanent members of the security council . " a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .
" this can happen only if there is wide consensus and wide support for reform . " italy should be a permanent member , says pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian leader said that italy was the sixth largest financial contributor to the united nations and noted that 40,000 italian troops were currently serving in un peacekeeping operations around the world . " from our point of view , it 's perfectly legitimate that italy could be a member of the security council , " he said . the 15-seat security council has only five permanent members with veto powers : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , india 's foreign minister natwar singh , brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim , and japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura - the so-called group of four a proposal by the by so-called g4 - brazil , germany , india and japan - would boost council membership to 25 , with six new permanent non-veto-wielding seats - one for each of the so-called g4 members and two for africa - and four non-permanent seats . opposition may delay decision until 2006 however the g4 plan is strongly opposed by two permanent members , china and the united states , and has also failed to secure the support of the 53-nation african union . un security general kofi annan conceded earlier this month that a deal on enlargement was unlikely by the end of the year despite speculation that the question of enlarging the security council is expected to figure prominently at this year 's un general assembly next month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .

köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .

on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .
it 's seen as paving the way for the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the end of the post-world war ii division of the continent .

30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .
after taking office in 2004 , poland was the first country to which he paid an official visit ; normally , german presidents visit france first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aleksander kwasnieski -lrb- left -rrb- and horst köhler inaugurated the polish-german year in berlin in april .
köhler has had more meetings with his polish counterpart than with any other head of state - a reflection of the significance the neighbors attach to bilateral ties .
two months ago , the german and polish presidents declared 2005/2006 a german-polish year to promote reconciliation and arouse interest in shared history and culture .

" manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .

wowereit told the mass-market daily bild that the german capital was a " tolerant and open " city that was pleased to have guests from all walks of life , even unconventional ones .
the mayor , who publicly declared his homosexuality before his election in 2001 , has come under fire for the official greetings in his name included in the program of the whips-and-chains festival starting friday .
" the international leather and fetish scene is meeting for the second time in berlin for the folsom europe 2005 street festival .
welcome to berlin ! " the letter reads .
" berlin is a tolerant and open metropolis .
we are proud that people from different backgrounds and with different preferences feel comfortable here and party together . "
the head of the conservative block in the berlin state legislature , nicolas zimmer , was quoted by bild as saying that the letter was " not in line with the dignity of the office " of mayor .
bild printed advertisements for the festival featuring bare-chested men licking each others ' jackboots and a man chained to a urinal and wearing leather briefs , boots and a gas mask under the heading " perverts . "
" there 's no question it is a flamboyant scene , but that is also berlin .
and as long as there is nothing forbidden happening , i expect tolerance , " wowereit told bild . dw-world.de to kiss or not to kiss known to enjoy a bit of fun , berlin 's openly gay mayor has come under criticism for smooching a woman in public : opposition members said such a public display display of affection is undignified .

adidas accused the fujian-based aile clothing and shoe company of using a design very similar to that of the three-stripe adidas trademarked logo .
it found the logo on aile products as well as its promotional materials in a beijing market in december 2002 , said huang hui , an attorney for adidas quoted by the china daily .
the two other companies - beijing jianlijia aile sports goods shop and the beijing ruiguan sports goods company - were accused of selling aile products bearing the offending logos , a beijing court heard monday . adidas is seeking three million yuan -lrb- $ 370,000 -rrb- in compensation , the report said , although the beijing jianlijia shop argued in its defense that the german manufacturer did not have enough evidence .
no ruling has yet been made .
piracy is rampant in china with widespread copying of brand-name clothing , pharmaceuticals and many other items .

dutschke was born in the former east germany and fled to the west with his family in 1961 just before the berlin wall was built .
by 1968 he had become the emblematic frontman of the socialist student protests sweeping germany and in april that year he survived an assassination attempt by a right-wing fanatic .
the idea to honour dutschke came from the left party , which controls the district , and has been backed by the greens .
but it is opposed by the conservative christian democrats , who argue that dutschke tried to undermine german democracy .
conservative tabloids newspapers , particularly the daily bild , also have opposed attempts to memorialize dutschke .
the street to be named after him runs through berlin 's old newspaper district , close by the building housing the axel springer group , which publishes bild .
dutschke died in retirement in denmark in december 1979 , having never fully recovered from his injuries . dw-world.de exhibit takes german terror stain public a controversial exhibition based on the life and times of the red army faction , germany 's own notorious terror group , opens in berlin on saturday in the face of continuing opposition .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .
turkey has fulfilled all the conditions that were decided upon during a summit last december of eu leaders , according to eu commission spokeswoman francoise lebail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus , friday , dec .
17 , 2004 turkey cleared the last obstacle to starting entry talks by signing what is known as the ankara protocol last month , extending its customs union to new eu members including cyprus .
lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .
frances raises pressure on turkey but not everyone agrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president erdogan , left with german chancellor schröder and chirac french president jacques chirac said on monday that turkey 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus did throw up problems .
on tuesday french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy issued a new call on tuesday for turkey to recognize cyprus .
" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in turkey voices of opposition can also be heard coming from germany .
angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .
according to diplomatic sources , frantic wrangling is underway behind the scenes on the wording of the agreement .
cyprus could veto the document and even austria has signaled it has doubts .
austrian eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , responsible for foreign policy , has said the eu has to be more careful in the future when it comes to promising membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's turkish delight chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .
turkey has fulfilled all the conditions that were decided upon during a summit last december of eu leaders , according to eu commission spokeswoman francoise lebail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus , friday , dec .
17 , 2004 turkey cleared the last obstacle to starting entry talks by signing what is known as the ankara protocol last month , extending its customs union to new eu members including cyprus .
lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .
frances raises pressure on turkey but not everyone agrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish president erdogan , left with german chancellor schröder and chirac french president jacques chirac said on monday that turkey 's refusal to recognize eu member state cyprus did throw up problems .
on tuesday french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy issued a new call on tuesday for turkey to recognize cyprus .
" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in turkey voices of opposition can also be heard coming from germany .
angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .
according to diplomatic sources , frantic wrangling is underway behind the scenes on the wording of the agreement .
cyprus could veto the document and even austria has signaled it has doubts .
austrian eu commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , responsible for foreign policy , has said the eu has to be more careful in the future when it comes to promising membership . bernd riegert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's turkish delight chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .

"
yan li is the berlin correspondent for radio china international .
dw-world talked to him about the state of affairs in germany and the upcoming election . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
yan li : by and large i like the country very much .
people have attitude and are very cultured .
but , yes , the economy is struggling - in berlin you find unemployment rates of some 20 percent .
the other thing i noticed is that there are so few kids and young people here .
it gives you the impression that germany is quite an " old " country and lacking in vitality .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
that 's a difficult one .
germany has long been a country with high levels of social welfare provided by the state .
people have come to depend on this and live too much off the state .
a reform in the social sector is necessary .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
i do n't have a preference .
but whoever gets to govern the country needs to commit to reforms .
but maybe for schröder it 's already the end of the road .
what do you like about germany ?
for me it 's always the beer , culture and history of the place .
what do you dislike about germany ?

since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .
in italy in contrast the situation feels more like five minutes after 12 , but no one cares anyway .
see that 's the point .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .
" the proposals presented by germany , brazil , india and japan meet the requirements of efficiency and of representation of different regions , notably africa . " chirac called for the reform to be passed by the time of a un summit that is due to take place in new york from sept .
14-16 , or failing that by the end of this year . meanwhile , at a news conference following the talks with president putin in the southern russian town of sochi , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called for a pause in debate on reform of the united nations , saying several current proposals for expanding membership on the security council could alienate a large number of un member states . berlusconi wants a pause in reform discussions " we believe that there will not be wide consensus and that we should not now discuss reform which could make many countries representing entire continents unhappy , " berlusconi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , right , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " the accession of one of these countries to the un security council runs the risk of embarrassing three or four other countries , " berlusconi added . italy has been among a number of countries that have opposed a plan that would see brazil , germany , india and japan - a so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- - all admitted as permanent members of the security council . " a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .
" this can happen only if there is wide consensus and wide support for reform . " italy should be a permanent member , says pm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian leader said that italy was the sixth largest financial contributor to the united nations and noted that 40,000 italian troops were currently serving in un peacekeeping operations around the world . " from our point of view , it 's perfectly legitimate that italy could be a member of the security council , " he said . the 15-seat security council has only five permanent members with veto powers : britain , china , france , russia and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from left to right , germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer , india 's foreign minister natwar singh , brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim , and japan 's foreign minister nobutaka machimura - the so-called group of four a proposal by the by so-called g4 - brazil , germany , india and japan - would boost council membership to 25 , with six new permanent non-veto-wielding seats - one for each of the so-called g4 members and two for africa - and four non-permanent seats . opposition may delay decision until 2006 however the g4 plan is strongly opposed by two permanent members , china and the united states , and has also failed to secure the support of the 53-nation african union . un security general kofi annan conceded earlier this month that a deal on enlargement was unlikely by the end of the year despite speculation that the question of enlarging the security council is expected to figure prominently at this year 's un general assembly next month . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform unlikely before year 's end many countries think un security council reform is needed , but disagree on how to do it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2005 köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- with kwasniewski in warsaw on monday at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland . kicking off a three-day visit to poland on tuesday , german president horst köhler attempted to ease the fears of his hosts in warsaw regarding the controversial center which is planned as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formely german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii . " there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .
1 . köhler will be one of 20 heads of state and government gathering in gdansk to mark solidarity 's anniversary .
on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .
it 's seen as paving the way for the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the end of the post-world war ii division of the continent .
bildunterschrift : workers carry lech walesa on their shoulders on aug .
30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .
after taking office in 2004 , poland was the first country to which he paid an official visit ; normally , german presidents visit france first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aleksander kwasnieski -lrb- left -rrb- and horst köhler inaugurated the polish-german year in berlin in april .
köhler has had more meetings with his polish counterpart than with any other head of state - a reflection of the significance the neighbors attach to bilateral ties .
two months ago , the german and polish presidents declared 2005/2006 a german-polish year to promote reconciliation and arouse interest in shared history and culture .
köhler fled to germany from what is now poland with his parents at the end of world war ii . mark caldwell -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking back on 25 years of solidarity solidarnosc , the workers ' union that played an important role in the fall of communism in poland , was founded 25 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2005 köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- with kwasniewski in warsaw on monday at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland . kicking off a three-day visit to poland on tuesday , german president horst köhler attempted to ease the fears of his hosts in warsaw regarding the controversial center which is planned as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formely german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii . " there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .
1 . köhler will be one of 20 heads of state and government gathering in gdansk to mark solidarity 's anniversary .
on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .
it 's seen as paving the way for the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the end of the post-world war ii division of the continent .
bildunterschrift : workers carry lech walesa on their shoulders on aug .
30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .
after taking office in 2004 , poland was the first country to which he paid an official visit ; normally , german presidents visit france first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aleksander kwasnieski -lrb- left -rrb- and horst köhler inaugurated the polish-german year in berlin in april .
köhler has had more meetings with his polish counterpart than with any other head of state - a reflection of the significance the neighbors attach to bilateral ties .
two months ago , the german and polish presidents declared 2005/2006 a german-polish year to promote reconciliation and arouse interest in shared history and culture .

" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .
turkey has fulfilled all the conditions that were decided upon during a summit last december of eu leaders , according to eu commission spokeswoman francoise lebail .

lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .

" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union .

doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .

to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .

angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .
according to diplomatic sources , frantic wrangling is underway behind the scenes on the wording of the agreement .

since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .
in italy in contrast the situation feels more like five minutes after 12 , but no one cares anyway .
see that 's the point .
everything is so serious here . ranty islam interviewed aktham suliman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sept .
11 emancipated german foreign policy after sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.08.2005 köhler seeks to soothe wwii controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler -lrb- left -rrb- with kwasniewski in warsaw on monday at the start of a visit to poland tuesday , german president köhler spoke about a controversial center against war-time expulsions to be built in berlin - an issue that has offended historical sensitivities in poland . kicking off a three-day visit to poland on tuesday , german president horst köhler attempted to ease the fears of his hosts in warsaw regarding the controversial center which is planned as a memorial for the millions of germans who were driven out in 1945 from formely german areas given to poland by stalin at the end of world war ii . " there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .
1 . köhler will be one of 20 heads of state and government gathering in gdansk to mark solidarity 's anniversary .
on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .
it 's seen as paving the way for the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the end of the post-world war ii division of the continent .
bildunterschrift : workers carry lech walesa on their shoulders on aug .
30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .
after taking office in 2004 , poland was the first country to which he paid an official visit ; normally , german presidents visit france first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aleksander kwasnieski -lrb- left -rrb- and horst köhler inaugurated the polish-german year in berlin in april .
köhler has had more meetings with his polish counterpart than with any other head of state - a reflection of the significance the neighbors attach to bilateral ties .
two months ago , the german and polish presidents declared 2005/2006 a german-polish year to promote reconciliation and arouse interest in shared history and culture .

france is urging turkey to clarify its position on cyprus . the eu commission is in no doubt that after years of preparation , turkey is ready to begin accession talks on october 3 .

lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .

" it is hardly conceivable that a country which is asking to enter a community refuses to recognize one of its members , " he told a conference of french ambassadors in paris . he said ankara must clarify its position on cyprus , but added that france would " respect its commitments but expects turkey and other candidate countries to respect theirs and satisfy the conditions for joining the union .

angela merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has demanded in a letter addressed to all conservative eu leaders and the eu commission to change the goal of the accession talks with turkey from full-fledged eu membership to a so-called " privileged partnership . "
doubts remain elmar brok , chairman of the committee on foreign affairs of the european parliament and cdu member , supports the move .
" it 's clear that the cyprus question ca n't just stay the way it is , " he said .
" we have to also ensure that the whole issue of the capacity of the eu to absorb more members is also cleared up and that ca n't be done in the foreseeable future , " brok added .
" for reasons of fairness , also towards turkey , we must find other ways - whether it 's privileged partnership or something else - to bind turkey closer to europe . "
eu foreign ministers are meeting on thursday and friday to discuss the negotiating framework for eu accession talks with turkey , which has to come to unanimous agreement .
according to diplomatic sources , frantic wrangling is underway behind the scenes on the wording of the agreement .

17 , 2004 turkey cleared the last obstacle to starting entry talks by signing what is known as the ankara protocol last month , extending its customs union to new eu members including cyprus .
lebail added that it was not necessary for ankara to formally recognize cyprus , whose northern part is occupied by the turkish army .
at the same time it would be good if turkey did move to ease tensions with cyprus , lebail said .
" it 's clear that that every effort that turkey makes before october 3 would be very helpful .
but turkey is not legally bound to do more than it already has , " lebail said .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .

30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .

since 2002 he has been the berlin correspondent for qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera , but has also spent half a year reporting from baghdad . dw-world : how is germany doing in your opinion ?
aktham suliman : much better than many germans think , certainly as seen from the outside .
then again five million unemployed seems shocking - something very hard to believe , not only within germany .
but those people with no job are still much better off than many people elsewhere in the world .
what needs to happen in germany to help speed up the country 's recovery ?
the political class needs to be more concrete and honest in naming the problems .
it is not credible to promise the elimination of unemployment .
but the promise to make a determined effort to deal with the problem is .
from a societal point of view , peoples ' identity is too strongly defined by their jobs .
if you have a job , you are someone , if you have no job you count for nothing , it seems .
people have to start thinking of how to live and live well despite being unemployed .
in syria unemployment is at least 20 to 30 percent and this is bad enough economically .
yet , people there do not let this fact deprive themselves of the ability to be happy .
i am not saying germany should convert to a form of traditional society , buy i wonder whether this country could do well adopting some of the aspects of more traditional societies .
schröder or merkel ?
who is your personal choice for chancellor ?
why ?
probably schröder .
much has been said about the government 's handling of the economy but one also has to acknowledge what the present government has accomplished with their foreign policy .
today germany is a safer place than the us and britain by virtue of a wise foreign and security policy .
i think one really has to see this point .
on the domestic side , i also think the reform of the citizenship law is very laudable , in particular the removal of this dreadful , longstanding reference to " blood " in defining who is german .
what do you like about germany ?
that it works !
if you have a problem , you know there 's a law to fix it .
the rule of law is a tremendous achievement and this country has a constitution to be really proud of .
what do you dislike about germany ?
the weather - but also the social weather .
people do n't laugh a lot .
i heard someone say that in germany everyone feels like it is five minutes before 12 .
in italy in contrast the situation feels more like five minutes after 12 , but no one cares anyway .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

however , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi once again voiced his disapproval . putin , holding talks with berlusconi on monday , said that his country would support germany if it had the backing of a majority of un members . " we are going to support germany 's candidacy on condition that a reform plan be put forward that will be supported by a majority of un members , " putin told journalists . chirac told an annual gathering of france 's international ambassadors that the world had delayed for too long an expansion of the un security council , and backed the inclusion on the key body of brazil , germany , india and japan as permanent members . " to take up the new challenges of collective security , to guarantee peace , the world needs a strong security council that better reflects today 's realities and balances , " the president said . chirac calls for no more delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it is time to go ahead with the enlargement , too long delayed , of this essential grouping , " he added .
" the proposals presented by germany , brazil , india and japan meet the requirements of efficiency and of representation of different regions , notably africa . " chirac called for the reform to be passed by the time of a un summit that is due to take place in new york from sept .
14-16 , or failing that by the end of this year . meanwhile , at a news conference following the talks with president putin in the southern russian town of sochi , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called for a pause in debate on reform of the united nations , saying several current proposals for expanding membership on the security council could alienate a large number of un member states . berlusconi wants a pause in reform discussions " we believe that there will not be wide consensus and that we should not now discuss reform which could make many countries representing entire continents unhappy , " berlusconi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin , right , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi " the accession of one of these countries to the un security council runs the risk of embarrassing three or four other countries , " berlusconi added . italy has been among a number of countries that have opposed a plan that would see brazil , germany , india and japan - a so-called group of four -lrb- g4 -rrb- - all admitted as permanent members of the security council . " a formula for reform must be found capable of overcoming such embarrassment and a positive way of leading this institution to greater strength , to greater authority for resolving international problems and international crises must be found , " berlusconi said .

" there is no serious political force in germany that wants to revise history with such a center , " köhler said . the german president added that the expulsion of millions of germans in 1945 was a result of german injustice .
köhler also recommended a european framework for the memorial . the center has long been a delicate issue between the two neighbors .
while plans for the center are supported by germany 's conservative opposition , chancellor schröder 's government is in favor of a european-wide initiative to remember all victims of postwar expulsion and not just germans . polish president alexander kwasniewski - like many other poles - has the impression that some germans would like to revise history and see germans predominantly as victims rather than perpetrators .
on tuesday , kwasniewski reasserted his " fundamental doubts " about such a center . focus on solidarity after talks with polish president aleksander kwasniewski on tuesday , köhler also laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the warsaw ghetto and uprising during world war ii .
he is to also take part in a ceremony to lay the foundations for a new german embassy in poland . on wednesday and thursday , the focus will turn to the 25th anniversary of the founding of the independent trade union solidarnosc -lrb- solidarity -rrb- on aug .
31 as well as the 66th anniversary of the german invasion of poland on sept .

on aug .
31 , 1980 sacked electrician and strike leader lech walesa proclaimed to fellow strikers at the gdansk shipyard , " we have free independent trade unions . "
that day solidarity was recognized by the polish communist government , the first free trade union in soviet-dominated eastern europe .
it 's seen as paving the way for the collapse of communism in eastern europe and the end of the post-world war ii division of the continent .

30 , 1980 strengthening german-polish ties in 1999 , köhler 's predecessor , johannes rau , became the first german president to take part in a polish ceremony commemorating the german invasion .
köhler has earned sympathy in poland by rejecting all claims by german expellees ' associations for compensation for german territory lost to poland after central europe 's borders were redrawn in the wake of germany 's defeat .
many poles see increased german interest in german civilian suffering during and after world war ii as a sign of fading remorse for nazi crimes . köhler , who was born in 1943 in what is now poland , has a great affinity for the country .
after taking office in 2004 , poland was the first country to which he paid an official visit ; normally , german presidents visit france first . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aleksander kwasnieski -lrb- left -rrb- and horst köhler inaugurated the polish-german year in berlin in april .
köhler has had more meetings with his polish counterpart than with any other head of state - a reflection of the significance the neighbors attach to bilateral ties .
two months ago , the german and polish presidents declared 2005/2006 a german-polish year to promote reconciliation and arouse interest in shared history and culture .

what is the attraction of the lonsdale brand for far-right extremists ? curious youngsters can now find out the answer to these and other right-wing related questions and discover how " uncool " neo-nazis are : it 's all in " andi , " a new comic that 's been launched by the western german state of north rhine-westphalia . the comic intends to address important questions regarding right-wing extremism .
it features andi , the star of the stories , and his friends murat and ben in situations where they face skinheads and the problems that arise from their attitudes and actions . there is of course a villain , the skinhead eisenheinrich , who dresses in classic neo-nazi fashions , hates foreigners and distribute cds of far-right bands at the local school . in the first edition , andi and his friends challenge eisenheinrich and his gang to a game of basketball , which the skinheads lose . " it 's hard to find enough people to play with when you only want to play with ' real germans , " ' says the hero andi . exposing hatred and hostility an initial print run of 100,000 " andi " comics is being distributed to 3,500 schools in north rhine-westphalia in what the state 's inerior minister , ingo wolf , called " a unique project in germany " at the launch .
he added that the cool " andi " should help to expose the propaganda of the extreme right " as it is ; hatred of people and hostile to democracy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anti-nazi hero was developed by the nrw state office for the protection of the constitution . " pupils are often approached by far-right groups and are confronted with their propaganda , " said author thomas grumke .
" we want to do something against that . " manga design carries important messages to make the intended impact on the audience , the comic is designed to mirror the lives of 14- to 16- year olds and appeal to their tastes . " we have asked the youngsters what they find exciting and hip , " grumke added .
the result is a flashy comic in the japanese manga style . this has not proved to be a problem for düsseldorf comic draftsman peter schaaff who was awarded the contract for the project . " it tackles a sensitive subject which appears in entertainment culture too little , " schaaff said , adding that the biggest challenge for him was to meet the needs of the young readers .
" is it cool enough for them ?
what shoes should the characters wear ? " schaaff took the original black and white first draft to the youngsters at a number of schools to get feedback .
the result surprised him .
" they agreed with the style and the drawings but they had problems with the content , " he said .
" many asked : ' why is nobody getting beat up here ? " ' of course , in the case of an educational comic there are always compromises , says author thomas grumke . " we want to appeal to the target group without having to take anything away from the content , " he said . information and education , not glorification the compromise was a story that was not too theoretical or dry but still contained the most important information in text boxes on the side of the main action .
these include facts about the signs and symbols of the extremist right , the german constitution and migration in the ruhr area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the appendix explains nazi emblems , abbreviations and far-right numeric codes such as " 88 " , the eighth letter in the alphabet side by side - hh : heil hitler . the mission of the publication is to be " a comic for democracy and against extremism " and not a textbook with instructions on right-wing extremism , wolf said . that 's why it is distributed to pupils in schools as part of a lesson and discussion on the dangers of extreme right-wing politics . " the comic is read together with the teacher , as a part of the lesson , " ingo wolf said . to keep the pupils in the loop , future editions will call on the help of youngsters to keep the storylines of " andi " going .
all students in north rhine-westphalia will be encouraged to take part in a competition to write for the comic with the best entries being illustrated by peter schaaff and published on the internet . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : drawing the unimaginable for many , comics still represent the fantasy realm of mickey mouse and spider-man .

but as a new exhibition shows , gdr punks had a very different agenda than that of their western counterparts . when michael böhlke , otherwise known as " pankow , " took to the stage at the opening of germany 's first-ever exhibition on punk in the gdr last friday , it was as if the last 25 years had never happened .
reunited with his former fellow renegades , he brought down the house .
" it felt so right - i realized that i was born to perform , " he said later .
but while members of many former punk bands in west germany went on to become household names - die toten hosen , die ärtzte , einstürzende neubauten , to name but a few - pankow never managed to carve out a successful musical career for himself .
like many of the gdr 's punks , his flirtation with counterculture had lasting repercussions .
in the late 1980s , he was refused permission to study theater directing and forced to train as a mechanic .
his former girlfriend jana - whose photo features in the exhibition - was sent to jail for her punk activities and is psychologically traumatized to this day .
" i was probably more of a hippy " disgusted by the " ostalgie " trend - nostalgia for life behind the berlin wall - pankow recently decided to put together an exhibition documenting the history of punk under east germany 's communist dictatorship .
and it 's not quite what you 'd expect .
broadly dismissed in the west as nihilistic , punk in the gdr was fuelled by optimism and a desire to change society .
bildunterschrift : " in retrospect , i was probably more of a hippy , " shrugged pankow .
" i had a vision ; i was full of hope that things could improve .
we did n't do drugs and we did n't drink - we thought we were better than everyone else , and every last loser in the gdr drank beer like it was going out of fashion , so being a teetotaller was a form of rebellion . "
it was also very bonding .
" punk was a cross-cultural phenomenon in the east , " explained pankow .
" the ' tristesse ' of the gdr unleashed a huge creative potential , and the minute you were on the margins of society you tapped into a network of other artistic activity . "
the cultural depth of gdr punk is reflected in the exhibition .
housed in a former industrial warehouse in prenzlauer berg , a neighborhood in the eastern part of the city , the show features paintings , drawings , print graphics , photography , super 8 film , collages , rare audio footage and miscellaneous pop culture ephemera such as record covers , buttons , flyers and posters .
from youthful rebel to political pariah bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 1979 , pankow was just another frustrated teenager .
" i was angry with my parents , angry with my school , angry with the state , " he said .
" but one day i saw a picture of johnny rotten from the sex pistols in ' bravo ' magazine , and he seemed like the exact embodiment of how i felt .
i went off and ripped up my jeans right then and there . "
to begin with , he was the only punk he knew , but the movement soon gathered momentum - largely inspired by events happening in england .
" every thursday , my friends and i would listen to the dj john peel at two o ' clock in the morning on our transistor radios , " he remembered .
" we used to hang out at alexanderplatz -lrb- a landmark square in the former east berlin -rrb- , because we knew that 's where the tourists were , and we wanted as many people to see us as possible . "
a conscious risk but the tourists were n't the only ones photographing the punks .
while the likes of the sex pistols might have been frowned upon by the british establishment , to be a punk in the former east germany was to be spied on by the secret police and to risk a jail sentence .
" punk inevitably became political very fast , " said pankow .
" if you were in a band , you had to apply for permission to perform in public and audition before a committee that would assess your musical competence , the way you looked - and above all , whether you were politically acceptable .
the punks refused to go along with this - it was considered a compromise . " # b # as the youthful rebellion began to spiral out of state control , punks in the gdr were no longer seen as disaffected teenagers - they were denounced as enemies of the state .
by 1983 the secret police had sunk its talons into the movement and the scene was slowly but surely infiltrated with informants , forced under pressure from the state to choose between cooperation , a jail sentence , expulsion or military service .
" it was shocking how many stasi collaborators there were in the punk scene , " said pankow , referring to the east german secret police .
but even though the scene had splintered amid acrimony and disappointment for good by 1989 , the exhibition opening on friday was a jubilant affair .
" it was like a class reunion , " he smiled . the exhibition " ostpunk – too much future " runs though sept .

the money is being given to councils to help cut the numbers in temporary bed and breakfast accommodation .
housing charity shelter cymru welcomed the funding but said more resources were needed , as more than 3,500 people were in temporary accommodation .
the grants , from the welsh assembly government , will be paid to 26 schemes across 19 local authorities .
social justice minister edwina hart said the money , worth £ 959,000 over two years , would help councils focus on providing more suitable accommodation , while also helping to prevent homelessness .
ms hart said : " i am concerned that many families and vulnerable young people find themselves staying in bed and breakfast accommodation where they often have no cooking facilities , limited space and no access to communal areas .
many homeless people are in bed and breakfast accommodation " of course , there will be emergencies where using this type of housing is unavoidable but , in general , we should be trying harder to provide more suitable accommodation for the homeless people in our care . "
housing charity shelter cymru said homelessness in wales last year hit record levels , with more than 10,000 people accepted as homeless by local authorities in the last quarter of 2004 .
it said more than 3,500 of the 10,000 people were in temporary accommodation .
the charity added that 900 of these people were in bed-and-breakfast accommodation and around 200 of these were families with children .
shelter cymru director john puzey welcomed the money , but said more was needed .
" the grants are something we welcome and support , but we believe there should be more resources , " he said .
he said the major worry was the number of people , including children , who were placed in temporary accommodation .
" there should be higher investment in social housing across the board - that is the long-term way we can deal with this problem , " mr puzey added .
earlier this month , he said that recorded homelessness was " growing alarmingly across the country " .
howard john , director of the welsh federation of housing associations , agreed the level of homelessness in wales was " high enough " .
the grants are being awarded as part of the assembly government 's homelessness grant programme , which has set a limit of £ 30,000 per scheme per year .
