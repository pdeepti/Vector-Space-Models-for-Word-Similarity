in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .

one ancient music style is currently taking zurich by storm . zurich 's conservatory of music has got an unexpected hit on its hands : classes in yodeling are booked solid for months to come .
what began centuries ago as a way of communicating across alpine valleys has become the new must-have experience for zurich 's professional classes and is now bringing some peace and harmony to switzerland 's biggest city .
yodeling teacher nadja räss has been overwhelmed by her success .
" it 's really nice for me , all my courses are full , people are just so happy to yodel , " she said .
" for me , that 's a great honor , because yodeling is my great love . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese-born takeo ischi -lrb- left -rrb- is a world-famous yodeling artist räss , who is only 26 , comes from an alpine community and has been yodeling since she was a child .
her zurich students are coming to it later though - and they 've had to fight the idea , strong in urban switzerland , that yodeling is at best old-fashioned , at worst ridiculous . some raised eyebrows graphic designer klaudia meisterhans said she gets some raised eyebrows when she tells her friends about her hobby .
" at first they are astonished , but when i tell them about it they get very interested , " she said .
" i think it 's a pity that there are so many nice songs that people do n't know .
most people think yodeling is this commercial kind of music but there is much more . "
bildunterschrift : not all yodeling fans have to dress like german yodeling mother-daughter duo maria and margot hellwig to yodel properly , the right breathing is essential .
räss insists on breathing exercises at the start of every lesson .
this may be one of the main reasons why stressed-out zurich professionals are attracted to the course . the feel-good factor economist joseph birchmeier said the yodeling simply makes him feel good .
" very relaxed , all the stress is gone , it 's a new life , a kind of new energy , " he said , adding that he 's even taken to yodeling in the car on his way to work .
" if i sing in the morning on the way to work i 'm in a much better mood , " he said .
" that 's good for me and for my colleagues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones may have replaced yodeling as a means of communication in the alps , but the traditional music is still far more relaxing the nature of the songs is also part of the attraction .
the lyrics are about the mountains , about being at one with nature , and about not worrying too much about tomorrow .
psychologist linde brassel has spent all her life in the city , but still , the alps - and yodeling - are part of her , she said .
" well , i 'm swiss , " brassel said .
" it 's just a way to feel at home in my body and to feel joy . " imogen foulkes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hodl-ay-ee-dee-ho !

but what that means exactly in terms of corporate responsibility toward society was less clear . the president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , repeatedly reminded the politicians present that corporations should not be made the scapegoats for a disappointing economic situation as germany switches into election campaign mode .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 18.06.2005 german soccer officials score high großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : samba vs. syrtaki - a highlight of the confed cup 2005 germany 's world cup test run is just days old and the praise so far has been resounding : everything well-organized and punctual , no hooligan problems and some high scoring games .
now if only more tickets would sell . as their team was getting dismantled on the field , greek fans in the stands at leipzig 's stadium thursday evening were slowly , but surely gaining the upper hand in the party duel against their brazilian rivals . the much-hyped syrtaki vs. samba matchup was more evident in the stands than on the pitch , where the european champions lost 0-3 to a far superior brazil side .
more than 44,000 fans , including greeks and brazilians from all over germany , filled the leipzig stadium with song , chants , and samba for most of the night .
outside , more than 15,000 partied on the street . " the international soccer family has been welcomed here , " said sepp blatter , president of the world soccer association fifa .
" you can feel the emotion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sepp blatter can feel it a party , and a safe one at that the brazil-greece matchup has so far provided the best atmosphere of the tournament .
but organizers and security officials are just as happy about fans watching the other three games .
there have been no arrests so far , and not a whisper of hooligan activity - either inside or outside the stadium .
" there have no incidents worth mentioning , " said a spokesperson at the state police agency responsible for sporting event security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1,000 german soccer fans protested against what they said were overly strict security controls .
the demonstration was planned and took place ahead of the germany-australia match .
granted , many of the countries known for hooliganism - england and the netherlands , for example - are not competing in the tournament .
but the opportunity offered by the confederations cup to fine-tune germany 's security concept will help police officials by the time the world cup rolls around next year . germans doing what germans do best germany 's well-earned reputation for good organization has been on full display so far .
frankfurt 's refurbished stadium , which played host to the opening germany match against australia on wednesday , was a building site the day before kickoff .
but everything was in place by the time the referee blew the start whistle . " german thoroughness , " was blatter 's explanation . things have n't been as thorough with ticket sales - at least so far .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .

true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .
" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .
chirac , too , said their offer was " very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " rift widens in eu the budget row has unmasked a deep gulf between countries like britain , which want a lean , market-oriented alliance and others who want a deeper union with social benefits for citizens . juncker accused some countries of lacking the political will to reach an agreement .
in an apparent attack on britain , he said those who wanted europe to be a simple free trade zone should explain how it could work . " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash , " he confessed .
" there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe , " he said .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .

" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .
chirac , too , said their offer was " very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " rift widens in eu the budget row has unmasked a deep gulf between countries like britain , which want a lean , market-oriented alliance and others who want a deeper union with social benefits for citizens . juncker accused some countries of lacking the political will to reach an agreement .
in an apparent attack on britain , he said those who wanted europe to be a simple free trade zone should explain how it could work . " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash , " he confessed .

he hopes the fans wo n't boo him this time around . a few weeks ago , bayern munich celebrated the opening of its brand new allianz arena with a game against the national team . in goal for munich was , as always , oliver kahn .
taking advantage of kahn 's absence on the night in the national team goal was his rival jens lehmann .
though his side wore the black , red and gold lehmann could n't help but feel he was playing for arch-rival england .
from the moment he entered the field , the mostly bayern fans in the arena booed him mercilessly , and chanted insults . lehmann and the rest of the team were shocked .
" it 's was absolutely ridiculous , " said team manager oliver bierhoff . " i did n't expect him to be supported .
but we 're the german national team , we were guests here and worked hard to fit this game into our schedule and we wanted to have a nice party , " he continued .
" it 's unacceptable that such problems arise . " suffering not-so-silently that being said , the whistles were something lehmann has gotten used to hearing .
the 35-year-old has been not-so-silently suffering behind kahn for more than three years .
the munich goalie , the number one since turning in a titanic performance at the world cup in south korea and japan in 2002 , has endured more than a few barbs from his competitor in goal - and has dished a few out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn has been number one since carrying the german national team to second place in the 2002 world cup lehmann 's loud calls for a fair shot at being germany 's number one have rubbed those who continue to deify kahn the wrong way .
but since jürgen klinsmann took over the reins of the national team in november and removed goalie coach , and kahn supporter , sepp maier , lehmann has gotten quieter - and more chances . he stood between the posts when germany wiped up belgium in a 3 - 0 game , and has raised eyebrows with spectacular performances for his club team , arsenal .
it was lehmann 's goalkeeping , including his saves in a penalty shootout , that helped arsenal beat manchester united and claim england 's football association cup this year . getting his chance klinsmann has rewarded his efforts by promising to rotate goalies in this tournament .
with kahn between the posts in the first game , lehmann gets his shot saturday against tunisia .
klinsmann has n't decided who will stand in goal for the crucial end game of the first round monday against argentina , something that does n't seem to bother lehmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if the fans do n't boo me , then it will already be a success . " " i do n't think too far in advance in soccer , " said lehmann .
" i 'm not really thinking about it . " but he has devoted a bit of time to thinking about how the spectators will receive him . " if the fans do n't boo me , then it will already be a success , " he said , wryly . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 . after giving up three goals to australia in the opening match , coach jürgen klinsmann ordered his midfield to drop back and give his young defenders some support .
for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .
after letting germany have a good start to the game , with a few chances , tunisia took the upper hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne fans love their lukas podolski and " prince poldi " did n't disappoint the african cup champions out-ed themselves as fine technicians with some fine passes .
when they were n't pressing the german midfield to drop back , they were disrupting their advances towards goal . " we lost our rhythm because the tunisians are very skilled , " said klinsmann . in the 27th minute , lehmann fell into the net blocking off a corner kick by brazilian born midfielder clayton .
the bizarre kick could have put germany under some serious pressure early in the game had it gone in .
klinsmann 's team responded gamely , but could n't find the holes as tunisian defenders radhi jaidi and hatem trabelsi made things difficult for ballack , bastian schweinsteiger and company . tunisia missing final touch the second half was all tunisia , as lemerre 's " mosquitos " made good on their coach 's threat and stormed the german goal .
but it was the final touch that eluded the north africans , and ultimately doomed them . lehmann , taking kahn 's place in goal for the game , made a nice stop of a slow rolling but dangerous tap in from adel chadli in the 56th minute .
tunisia continued to press until ballack fell in the box . bildunterschrift : jens lehmann needed his entire body for the nice save the youth investment pays off freed of the burden of a tie game , germany became more aggressive following ballack 's score .
in the 80th , 20-year-old lukas podolski , who has had a strong game , led schweinsteiger perfectly .
the bayern munich creative midfielder dribbled around ali boumnijel and popped the ball in from a tough angle . eight minutes later , the newly substituted mike hanke , another youngster , took a gorgeous cross from deisler in the center of the box .
after his initial header was turned away , he volleyed the rebound in , giving germany its final stand - and most likely sending them into the semifinal round . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for his shot as divisive a figure as exists on the national team , arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann will replace oliver kahn in the german goal in today 's match-up against tunisia .

for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .
" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed .

but what that means exactly in terms of corporate responsibility toward society was less clear . the president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , repeatedly reminded the politicians present that corporations should not be made the scapegoats for a disappointing economic situation as germany switches into election campaign mode .
instead of going with the flow , thumann recommended that politicians work on creating a climate of trust around business and investing . " in the long-term , corporations can only serve their communities if they are successful , " thumann said .
" business success creates and secures jobs , which is a large part of their responsibility .
it 's the best service to a community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator wears an " i 'm a deutsche bank victim " during a protest against the bank 's downsizing decision .
it 's also the duty of all corporations only to get rid of jobs in an extreme emergency , said thumann , adding that it 's up to company leaders to look for alternatives to job cuts to secure their competitive advantage .
in the same way , said union leaders , companies that are successful are obliged to reward their workforce . " when companies make profits - and we have never been against profit-making - it 's our opinion that the workers who helped to create this success should also share in it , " said jürgen peters , the head of the metal workers ' union , ig metall . speaking up for the eu but further social responsibility in geographical terms has been demanded by the eu 's commissioner for enterprise and industry , günter verheugen .
german companies need to involve themselves more in europe and do what they can to combat negative images of the eu , verheugen said . " socially responsible enterprise in germany means making sure in your own ranks , that no one achieves competitive advantage by bringing in illegal or borderline legal cheap labor from other parts of the world only to be exploited here , " verheugen said as part of his appeal to industry leaders . enterprise in the european union has to be about more than just profit maximization and getting a better position on the global market , verheugen said , adding that a strong economy is one of the fundamental ingredients of the european concept of communal living . karin kails -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring family-friendly companies as the last echoes of the recent capitalism debate die out , the winners of the title " germany 's most family-friendly companies " are pioneering the principle of humane business models .

read what eu leaders had to say about the crisis . eu council president : jean-claude juncker speaking following the break-up of negotiations : " people will tell you next that europe is not in responding to the offer from the 10 newcomer states to dig deeper into their own pockets for the sake of rescuing the compromise : " when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day . " regarding britain 's tony blair who takes over the eu presidency in two weeks : " no comment .
no opinion .
no advice " on europe 's future : " my enthusiasm for europe is crushed . " german chancellor gerhard schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
speaking at a news briefing on what could have been achieved for the 2007-2013 budget : " with the goodwill of everyone , i believe a deal would have been possible . … we have not succeeded in reaching agreement , even though a deal would have sent an important signal regarding the ability of the eu to act . " on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .
a piece has been lost from europe as a political union .
that makes me sad . " " europe has not emerged a winner , and that 's putting it very carefully . " on the role of the 10 new member states and their willingness to hold back their own demands : " there is a bright spot that shines in europe and it will light up others . " french president jacques chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
" europe is in a deep crisis , " chirac told a midnight news conference , blaming " the selfishness of two or three rich countries " for the failure . on the efforts of the 10 new members : " it was very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " speaking on britain 's role in the debate : " he -lrb- blair -rrb- wanted to keep the entirety of his check -lrb- the british rebate -rrb- . … i deplore the fact that the united kingdom refused to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of the expenses of enlargement . " summarizing the summit : " a very bad outcome for europe . " british prime minister tony blair reason for rejecting the budget compromise : " it does n't reflect the europe we need in the 21st century . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair gestures after a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
defending britain 's position : " we were not alone at the -lrb- summit -rrb- table . " " i think people know exactly what the issues are here and i do n't think they are fooled by the tactics and the maneuvers . … i hope we can move forward from here . " blair 's foreign secretary , jack straw on the crux of the debate : " it 's essentially a division between whether you want a european union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a european union that is trapped in the past .
it is not one that europe can dodge . " polish prime minister marek belka leading the initiative of the 10 member states : " it was in our interest to reach an early compromise , it was in the interest of all new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster promoting eu expansion on may 1 , 2004 on the role of the bigger members : " my proposal was a reaction to what i perceived as the selfishness of some member states .
i asked , is it all about money , if so how much ? " " the fact that we don not have a budget is not disturbing .
what is disturbing is the atmosphere in the eu . " slovenian prime minister janez jansa the budget fight showed the " new europe which emerged from expansion was not being seriously considered by the old eu members . " czech prime minister jiri paroubek " it is ridiculous and disappointing and for us new eu members absolutely incomprehensible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2005 security council reform : where it stands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the shape of global representation the so-called group of four nations - germany , india , japan and brazil - are pushing ahead for permanent seats on the un security council .
but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .
he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .
" it is now high time , to change it to reflect the new world order . together with brazil , india and japan , germany is ready to take on more responsibility for the security in the world . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us wary of german security council bid washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority .
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- germany starts un reform resolution germany , together with india , japan and brazil , has started circulating a draft un motion calling for an enlargement of the un security council .
the us and china are showing signs of resistance .
-lrb- may 17 , 2005 -rrb- germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .

but what that means exactly in terms of corporate responsibility toward society was less clear . the president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , repeatedly reminded the politicians present that corporations should not be made the scapegoats for a disappointing economic situation as germany switches into election campaign mode .
instead of going with the flow , thumann recommended that politicians work on creating a climate of trust around business and investing . " in the long-term , corporations can only serve their communities if they are successful , " thumann said .
" business success creates and secures jobs , which is a large part of their responsibility .
it 's the best service to a community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator wears an " i 'm a deutsche bank victim " during a protest against the bank 's downsizing decision .
it 's also the duty of all corporations only to get rid of jobs in an extreme emergency , said thumann , adding that it 's up to company leaders to look for alternatives to job cuts to secure their competitive advantage .
in the same way , said union leaders , companies that are successful are obliged to reward their workforce . " when companies make profits - and we have never been against profit-making - it 's our opinion that the workers who helped to create this success should also share in it , " said jürgen peters , the head of the metal workers ' union , ig metall . speaking up for the eu but further social responsibility in geographical terms has been demanded by the eu 's commissioner for enterprise and industry , günter verheugen .
german companies need to involve themselves more in europe and do what they can to combat negative images of the eu , verheugen said . " socially responsible enterprise in germany means making sure in your own ranks , that no one achieves competitive advantage by bringing in illegal or borderline legal cheap labor from other parts of the world only to be exploited here , " verheugen said as part of his appeal to industry leaders . enterprise in the european union has to be about more than just profit maximization and getting a better position on the global market , verheugen said , adding that a strong economy is one of the fundamental ingredients of the european concept of communal living . karin kails -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring family-friendly companies as the last echoes of the recent capitalism debate die out , the winners of the title " germany 's most family-friendly companies " are pioneering the principle of humane business models .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2005 security council reform : where it stands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the shape of global representation the so-called group of four nations - germany , india , japan and brazil - are pushing ahead for permanent seats on the un security council .
but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .
he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .
" it is now high time , to change it to reflect the new world order . together with brazil , india and japan , germany is ready to take on more responsibility for the security in the world .

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .
in the 89th minute , he got that third strike when an inattentive australian defense allowed a free-kick cross from juan ramon riqulme to reach figueroa on the far post .
he needed only to touch the ball to assure argentina of victory . last group match has meaning on tuesday , the two semi-finalists , germany and argentina , will meet in nuremberg to determine who wins the group and , most likely , avoid world champs brazil in the semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allowed a late goal in february and missed a chance to break the curse against world-class teams they met in düsseldorf in february and played to a 2-2 draw , thanks to a late strike by the argentinean striker hernan crespo .
he is at home for this tournament , but figueroa filled his shoes nicely against australia . germany on the other hand are hungry .
it 's been almost five years since a victory against one of the world 's top teams , a 1-0 win in wembley against england .
jürgen klinsmann has been able to put a few feathers in his cap since taking over the team that humiliated itself at the euro 2004 .
the big win , along with the big feather , is missing , though .

what began centuries ago as a way of communicating across alpine valleys has become the new must-have experience for zurich 's professional classes and is now bringing some peace and harmony to switzerland 's biggest city .
yodeling teacher nadja räss has been overwhelmed by her success .
" it 's really nice for me , all my courses are full , people are just so happy to yodel , " she said .
" for me , that 's a great honor , because yodeling is my great love . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese-born takeo ischi -lrb- left -rrb- is a world-famous yodeling artist räss , who is only 26 , comes from an alpine community and has been yodeling since she was a child .
her zurich students are coming to it later though - and they 've had to fight the idea , strong in urban switzerland , that yodeling is at best old-fashioned , at worst ridiculous . some raised eyebrows graphic designer klaudia meisterhans said she gets some raised eyebrows when she tells her friends about her hobby .
" at first they are astonished , but when i tell them about it they get very interested , " she said .
" i think it 's a pity that there are so many nice songs that people do n't know .
most people think yodeling is this commercial kind of music but there is much more . "
bildunterschrift : not all yodeling fans have to dress like german yodeling mother-daughter duo maria and margot hellwig to yodel properly , the right breathing is essential .
räss insists on breathing exercises at the start of every lesson .
this may be one of the main reasons why stressed-out zurich professionals are attracted to the course . the feel-good factor economist joseph birchmeier said the yodeling simply makes him feel good .
" very relaxed , all the stress is gone , it 's a new life , a kind of new energy , " he said , adding that he 's even taken to yodeling in the car on his way to work .
" if i sing in the morning on the way to work i 'm in a much better mood , " he said .
" that 's good for me and for my colleagues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones may have replaced yodeling as a means of communication in the alps , but the traditional music is still far more relaxing the nature of the songs is also part of the attraction .
the lyrics are about the mountains , about being at one with nature , and about not worrying too much about tomorrow .
psychologist linde brassel has spent all her life in the city , but still , the alps - and yodeling - are part of her , she said .
" well , i 'm swiss , " brassel said .
" it 's just a way to feel at home in my body and to feel joy . " imogen foulkes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hodl-ay-ee-dee-ho !

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .
in the 89th minute , he got that third strike when an inattentive australian defense allowed a free-kick cross from juan ramon riqulme to reach figueroa on the far post .
he needed only to touch the ball to assure argentina of victory . last group match has meaning on tuesday , the two semi-finalists , germany and argentina , will meet in nuremberg to determine who wins the group and , most likely , avoid world champs brazil in the semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allowed a late goal in february and missed a chance to break the curse against world-class teams they met in düsseldorf in february and played to a 2-2 draw , thanks to a late strike by the argentinean striker hernan crespo .
he is at home for this tournament , but figueroa filled his shoes nicely against australia . germany on the other hand are hungry .
it 's been almost five years since a victory against one of the world 's top teams , a 1-0 win in wembley against england .
jürgen klinsmann has been able to put a few feathers in his cap since taking over the team that humiliated itself at the euro 2004 .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .
he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .
" it is now high time , to change it to reflect the new world order . together with brazil , india and japan , germany is ready to take on more responsibility for the security in the world .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

from the moment he entered the field , the mostly bayern fans in the arena booed him mercilessly , and chanted insults . lehmann and the rest of the team were shocked .

from the moment he entered the field , the mostly bayern fans in the arena booed him mercilessly , and chanted insults . lehmann and the rest of the team were shocked .

we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .
" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .
chirac , too , said their offer was " very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " rift widens in eu the budget row has unmasked a deep gulf between countries like britain , which want a lean , market-oriented alliance and others who want a deeper union with social benefits for citizens . juncker accused some countries of lacking the political will to reach an agreement .
in an apparent attack on britain , he said those who wanted europe to be a simple free trade zone should explain how it could work . " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash , " he confessed .
" there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe , " he said .

" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .
" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .
chirac , too , said their offer was " very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " rift widens in eu the budget row has unmasked a deep gulf between countries like britain , which want a lean , market-oriented alliance and others who want a deeper union with social benefits for citizens . juncker accused some countries of lacking the political will to reach an agreement .
in an apparent attack on britain , he said those who wanted europe to be a simple free trade zone should explain how it could work . " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash , " he confessed .
" there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe , " he said .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .
" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .
chirac , too , said their offer was " very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " rift widens in eu the budget row has unmasked a deep gulf between countries like britain , which want a lean , market-oriented alliance and others who want a deeper union with social benefits for citizens . juncker accused some countries of lacking the political will to reach an agreement .
in an apparent attack on britain , he said those who wanted europe to be a simple free trade zone should explain how it could work . " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash , " he confessed .
" there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2005 security council reform : where it stands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the shape of global representation the so-called group of four nations - germany , india , japan and brazil - are pushing ahead for permanent seats on the un security council .
but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 . after giving up three goals to australia in the opening match , coach jürgen klinsmann ordered his midfield to drop back and give his young defenders some support .
for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .
after letting germany have a good start to the game , with a few chances , tunisia took the upper hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne fans love their lukas podolski and " prince poldi " did n't disappoint the african cup champions out-ed themselves as fine technicians with some fine passes .
when they were n't pressing the german midfield to drop back , they were disrupting their advances towards goal . " we lost our rhythm because the tunisians are very skilled , " said klinsmann . in the 27th minute , lehmann fell into the net blocking off a corner kick by brazilian born midfielder clayton .
the bizarre kick could have put germany under some serious pressure early in the game had it gone in .
klinsmann 's team responded gamely , but could n't find the holes as tunisian defenders radhi jaidi and hatem trabelsi made things difficult for ballack , bastian schweinsteiger and company . tunisia missing final touch the second half was all tunisia , as lemerre 's " mosquitos " made good on their coach 's threat and stormed the german goal .
but it was the final touch that eluded the north africans , and ultimately doomed them . lehmann , taking kahn 's place in goal for the game , made a nice stop of a slow rolling but dangerous tap in from adel chadli in the 56th minute .
tunisia continued to press until ballack fell in the box . bildunterschrift : jens lehmann needed his entire body for the nice save the youth investment pays off freed of the burden of a tie game , germany became more aggressive following ballack 's score .
in the 80th , 20-year-old lukas podolski , who has had a strong game , led schweinsteiger perfectly .
the bayern munich creative midfielder dribbled around ali boumnijel and popped the ball in from a tough angle . eight minutes later , the newly substituted mike hanke , another youngster , took a gorgeous cross from deisler in the center of the box .

germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 . after giving up three goals to australia in the opening match , coach jürgen klinsmann ordered his midfield to drop back and give his young defenders some support .
for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .

the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .

" it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.06.2005 forget yoga , try yodeling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sing ommm , err , yodl-ay-ee-hoo switzerland may not be especially famous for producing world class composers or rock bands , but that does n't mean the swiss do n't love music .
one ancient music style is currently taking zurich by storm . zurich 's conservatory of music has got an unexpected hit on its hands : classes in yodeling are booked solid for months to come .
what began centuries ago as a way of communicating across alpine valleys has become the new must-have experience for zurich 's professional classes and is now bringing some peace and harmony to switzerland 's biggest city .
yodeling teacher nadja räss has been overwhelmed by her success .
" it 's really nice for me , all my courses are full , people are just so happy to yodel , " she said .
" for me , that 's a great honor , because yodeling is my great love . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese-born takeo ischi -lrb- left -rrb- is a world-famous yodeling artist räss , who is only 26 , comes from an alpine community and has been yodeling since she was a child .
her zurich students are coming to it later though - and they 've had to fight the idea , strong in urban switzerland , that yodeling is at best old-fashioned , at worst ridiculous . some raised eyebrows graphic designer klaudia meisterhans said she gets some raised eyebrows when she tells her friends about her hobby .
" at first they are astonished , but when i tell them about it they get very interested , " she said .
" i think it 's a pity that there are so many nice songs that people do n't know .
most people think yodeling is this commercial kind of music but there is much more . "
bildunterschrift : not all yodeling fans have to dress like german yodeling mother-daughter duo maria and margot hellwig to yodel properly , the right breathing is essential .
räss insists on breathing exercises at the start of every lesson .
this may be one of the main reasons why stressed-out zurich professionals are attracted to the course . the feel-good factor economist joseph birchmeier said the yodeling simply makes him feel good .
" very relaxed , all the stress is gone , it 's a new life , a kind of new energy , " he said , adding that he 's even taken to yodeling in the car on his way to work .
" if i sing in the morning on the way to work i 'm in a much better mood , " he said .
" that 's good for me and for my colleagues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones may have replaced yodeling as a means of communication in the alps , but the traditional music is still far more relaxing the nature of the songs is also part of the attraction .
the lyrics are about the mountains , about being at one with nature , and about not worrying too much about tomorrow .
psychologist linde brassel has spent all her life in the city , but still , the alps - and yodeling - are part of her , she said .
" well , i 'm swiss , " brassel said .
" it 's just a way to feel at home in my body and to feel joy . " imogen foulkes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hodl-ay-ee-dee-ho !

now even ponytails are allowed in the german army after a few shaggy men demanded equal treatment with the women . demi moore might have shaved off her luxurious mane to prove she was just as tough as her male colleagues .
but these days in germany , soldiers are looking more enviously towards gi jane 's long hair and demanding equal treatment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : male and female recruits - same uniforms , different hairstyles equal treatment for all – those were the arguments german women used to gain entry into the army .
now the men are doing an about-face and learning to apply the same terms to push gender neutrality .
after all , why should n't men also enjoy the same pleasures of coming through their long locks ? that 's what an 18-year-old recruit argued , when his commanding officer demanded he cut off his 25-centimeter long ponytail .
when he refused to do so , he was imprisoned for subordination and fined 150 euros .
only after he was faced with up to three weeks arrest , did the young man agree to sacrifice his tresses . at the same time he sought legal council and demanded the repeal of the so-called " hair and beard regulation , " which enforces strict - and specifically short - standards of hairdressing for men -lrb- " closely cut so that it lies flat on the head ; it must not cover the ears or eyes of the soldier -rrb- , while allowing longer coiffures for women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ponytale might not look that bad the fact that female soldiers could get away with wearing a wider range of hairdos as long as they did n't interfere with the correct placement of the hat was unfair , the soldier argued .
it meant he did n't have the same freedom to develop his personality as the women . a military court in bavaria was convinced .

" on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day .

" on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .
a piece has been lost from europe as a political union .

" speaking on britain 's role in the debate : " he -lrb- blair -rrb- wanted to keep the entirety of his check -lrb- the british rebate -rrb- . … i deplore the fact that the united kingdom refused to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of the expenses of enlargement .

" " i think people know exactly what the issues are here and i do n't think they are fooled by the tactics and the maneuvers . … i hope we can move forward from here . " blair 's foreign secretary , jack straw on the crux of the debate : " it 's essentially a division between whether you want a european union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a european union that is trapped in the past .
it is not one that europe can dodge . " polish prime minister marek belka leading the initiative of the 10 member states : " it was in our interest to reach an early compromise , it was in the interest of all new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster promoting eu expansion on may 1 , 2004 on the role of the bigger members : " my proposal was a reaction to what i perceived as the selfishness of some member states .

germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 . after giving up three goals to australia in the opening match , coach jürgen klinsmann ordered his midfield to drop back and give his young defenders some support .
for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .
after letting germany have a good start to the game , with a few chances , tunisia took the upper hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne fans love their lukas podolski and " prince poldi " did n't disappoint the african cup champions out-ed themselves as fine technicians with some fine passes .
when they were n't pressing the german midfield to drop back , they were disrupting their advances towards goal . " we lost our rhythm because the tunisians are very skilled , " said klinsmann . in the 27th minute , lehmann fell into the net blocking off a corner kick by brazilian born midfielder clayton .
the bizarre kick could have put germany under some serious pressure early in the game had it gone in .
klinsmann 's team responded gamely , but could n't find the holes as tunisian defenders radhi jaidi and hatem trabelsi made things difficult for ballack , bastian schweinsteiger and company . tunisia missing final touch the second half was all tunisia , as lemerre 's " mosquitos " made good on their coach 's threat and stormed the german goal .
but it was the final touch that eluded the north africans , and ultimately doomed them . lehmann , taking kahn 's place in goal for the game , made a nice stop of a slow rolling but dangerous tap in from adel chadli in the 56th minute .
tunisia continued to press until ballack fell in the box . bildunterschrift : jens lehmann needed his entire body for the nice save the youth investment pays off freed of the burden of a tie game , germany became more aggressive following ballack 's score .
in the 80th , 20-year-old lukas podolski , who has had a strong game , led schweinsteiger perfectly .
the bayern munich creative midfielder dribbled around ali boumnijel and popped the ball in from a tough angle . eight minutes later , the newly substituted mike hanke , another youngster , took a gorgeous cross from deisler in the center of the box .
after his initial header was turned away , he volleyed the rebound in , giving germany its final stand - and most likely sending them into the semifinal round . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for his shot as divisive a figure as exists on the national team , arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann will replace oliver kahn in the german goal in today 's match-up against tunisia .

germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 . after giving up three goals to australia in the opening match , coach jürgen klinsmann ordered his midfield to drop back and give his young defenders some support .
for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .

when they were n't pressing the german midfield to drop back , they were disrupting their advances towards goal . " we lost our rhythm because the tunisians are very skilled , " said klinsmann . in the 27th minute , lehmann fell into the net blocking off a corner kick by brazilian born midfielder clayton .
the bizarre kick could have put germany under some serious pressure early in the game had it gone in .
klinsmann 's team responded gamely , but could n't find the holes as tunisian defenders radhi jaidi and hatem trabelsi made things difficult for ballack , bastian schweinsteiger and company . tunisia missing final touch the second half was all tunisia , as lemerre 's " mosquitos " made good on their coach 's threat and stormed the german goal .
but it was the final touch that eluded the north africans , and ultimately doomed them . lehmann , taking kahn 's place in goal for the game , made a nice stop of a slow rolling but dangerous tap in from adel chadli in the 56th minute .
tunisia continued to press until ballack fell in the box . bildunterschrift : jens lehmann needed his entire body for the nice save the youth investment pays off freed of the burden of a tie game , germany became more aggressive following ballack 's score .

read what eu leaders had to say about the crisis . eu council president : jean-claude juncker speaking following the break-up of negotiations : " people will tell you next that europe is not in responding to the offer from the 10 newcomer states to dig deeper into their own pockets for the sake of rescuing the compromise : " when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day . " regarding britain 's tony blair who takes over the eu presidency in two weeks : " no comment .
no opinion .
no advice " on europe 's future : " my enthusiasm for europe is crushed . " german chancellor gerhard schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
speaking at a news briefing on what could have been achieved for the 2007-2013 budget : " with the goodwill of everyone , i believe a deal would have been possible . … we have not succeeded in reaching agreement , even though a deal would have sent an important signal regarding the ability of the eu to act . " on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .

germany turned around an unspectacular effort , scoring three unanswered goals late in the second half to stun tunisia 3-0 . after giving up three goals to australia in the opening match , coach jürgen klinsmann ordered his midfield to drop back and give his young defenders some support .
for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .

when they were n't pressing the german midfield to drop back , they were disrupting their advances towards goal . " we lost our rhythm because the tunisians are very skilled , " said klinsmann . in the 27th minute , lehmann fell into the net blocking off a corner kick by brazilian born midfielder clayton .
the bizarre kick could have put germany under some serious pressure early in the game had it gone in .
klinsmann 's team responded gamely , but could n't find the holes as tunisian defenders radhi jaidi and hatem trabelsi made things difficult for ballack , bastian schweinsteiger and company . tunisia missing final touch the second half was all tunisia , as lemerre 's " mosquitos " made good on their coach 's threat and stormed the german goal .
but it was the final touch that eluded the north africans , and ultimately doomed them . lehmann , taking kahn 's place in goal for the game , made a nice stop of a slow rolling but dangerous tap in from adel chadli in the 56th minute .
tunisia continued to press until ballack fell in the box . bildunterschrift : jens lehmann needed his entire body for the nice save the youth investment pays off freed of the burden of a tie game , germany became more aggressive following ballack 's score .

read what eu leaders had to say about the crisis . eu council president : jean-claude juncker speaking following the break-up of negotiations : " people will tell you next that europe is not in responding to the offer from the 10 newcomer states to dig deeper into their own pockets for the sake of rescuing the compromise : " when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day . " regarding britain 's tony blair who takes over the eu presidency in two weeks : " no comment .
no opinion .
no advice " on europe 's future : " my enthusiasm for europe is crushed . " german chancellor gerhard schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
speaking at a news briefing on what could have been achieved for the 2007-2013 budget : " with the goodwill of everyone , i believe a deal would have been possible . … we have not succeeded in reaching agreement , even though a deal would have sent an important signal regarding the ability of the eu to act . " on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .
a piece has been lost from europe as a political union .
that makes me sad . " " europe has not emerged a winner , and that 's putting it very carefully . " on the role of the 10 new member states and their willingness to hold back their own demands : " there is a bright spot that shines in europe and it will light up others . " french president jacques chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
" europe is in a deep crisis , " chirac told a midnight news conference , blaming " the selfishness of two or three rich countries " for the failure . on the efforts of the 10 new members : " it was very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " speaking on britain 's role in the debate : " he -lrb- blair -rrb- wanted to keep the entirety of his check -lrb- the british rebate -rrb- . … i deplore the fact that the united kingdom refused to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of the expenses of enlargement . " summarizing the summit : " a very bad outcome for europe . " british prime minister tony blair reason for rejecting the budget compromise : " it does n't reflect the europe we need in the 21st century . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair gestures after a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
defending britain 's position : " we were not alone at the -lrb- summit -rrb- table . " " i think people know exactly what the issues are here and i do n't think they are fooled by the tactics and the maneuvers . … i hope we can move forward from here . " blair 's foreign secretary , jack straw on the crux of the debate : " it 's essentially a division between whether you want a european union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a european union that is trapped in the past .
it is not one that europe can dodge . " polish prime minister marek belka leading the initiative of the 10 member states : " it was in our interest to reach an early compromise , it was in the interest of all new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster promoting eu expansion on may 1 , 2004 on the role of the bigger members : " my proposal was a reaction to what i perceived as the selfishness of some member states .
i asked , is it all about money , if so how much ? " " the fact that we don not have a budget is not disturbing .
what is disturbing is the atmosphere in the eu . " slovenian prime minister janez jansa the budget fight showed the " new europe which emerged from expansion was not being seriously considered by the old eu members .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .

after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .

now if only more tickets would sell . as their team was getting dismantled on the field , greek fans in the stands at leipzig 's stadium thursday evening were slowly , but surely gaining the upper hand in the party duel against their brazilian rivals . the much-hyped syrtaki vs. samba matchup was more evident in the stands than on the pitch , where the european champions lost 0-3 to a far superior brazil side .
more than 44,000 fans , including greeks and brazilians from all over germany , filled the leipzig stadium with song , chants , and samba for most of the night .
outside , more than 15,000 partied on the street . " the international soccer family has been welcomed here , " said sepp blatter , president of the world soccer association fifa .
" you can feel the emotion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sepp blatter can feel it a party , and a safe one at that the brazil-greece matchup has so far provided the best atmosphere of the tournament .
but organizers and security officials are just as happy about fans watching the other three games .
there have been no arrests so far , and not a whisper of hooligan activity - either inside or outside the stadium .
" there have no incidents worth mentioning , " said a spokesperson at the state police agency responsible for sporting event security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1,000 german soccer fans protested against what they said were overly strict security controls .
the demonstration was planned and took place ahead of the germany-australia match .
granted , many of the countries known for hooliganism - england and the netherlands , for example - are not competing in the tournament .
but the opportunity offered by the confederations cup to fine-tune germany 's security concept will help police officials by the time the world cup rolls around next year . germans doing what germans do best germany 's well-earned reputation for good organization has been on full display so far .
frankfurt 's refurbished stadium , which played host to the opening germany match against australia on wednesday , was a building site the day before kickoff .
but everything was in place by the time the referee blew the start whistle . " german thoroughness , " was blatter 's explanation . things have n't been as thorough with ticket sales - at least so far .
tournament favorites argentina played in front of only 25,000 spectators against tunisia in cologne on wednesday .
only 24,000 spectators watched japan against mexico in hanover a day later .
around 540,000 of a total 620,000 tickets have been sold , a figure below the 600,000 organizers had hoped to sell by now . but as the matches continue to win in importance , the number of spectators will grow , say officials .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .
" we were not alone at the table , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's foreign minister fischer , chancellor schröder , dutch prime minister balkenende and austrian chancellor schüssel at the eu summit " i hope we can move forward from here , " blair told reporters , as he reiterated his call for a thorough review of the way the european union spends its money .
in two weeks , the rotating eu presidency will pass over to britain . shame on the rich members in a desperate attempt to save the negotiations , the 10 eu newcomer states called for new efforts to strike an accord , offering to dig deeper into their pockets if it would help .
the call went unheeded . juncker , trembling with emotion , said their offer made him ashamed .
" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .
chirac , too , said their offer was " very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " rift widens in eu the budget row has unmasked a deep gulf between countries like britain , which want a lean , market-oriented alliance and others who want a deeper union with social benefits for citizens . juncker accused some countries of lacking the political will to reach an agreement .
in an apparent attack on britain , he said those who wanted europe to be a simple free trade zone should explain how it could work . " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash , " he confessed .
" there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe , " he said . " i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day .

eu leaders deadlocked on budget despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget .
-lrb- june 17 , 2005 -rrb- eu constitution gets time for reflection late thursday , eu leaders extended a deadline for ratifying the european constitution .
while it does little to solve the current crisis , many hope the reprieve will help the bloc re-channel its energies for the future .

if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

now if only more tickets would sell . as their team was getting dismantled on the field , greek fans in the stands at leipzig 's stadium thursday evening were slowly , but surely gaining the upper hand in the party duel against their brazilian rivals . the much-hyped syrtaki vs. samba matchup was more evident in the stands than on the pitch , where the european champions lost 0-3 to a far superior brazil side .
more than 44,000 fans , including greeks and brazilians from all over germany , filled the leipzig stadium with song , chants , and samba for most of the night .
outside , more than 15,000 partied on the street . " the international soccer family has been welcomed here , " said sepp blatter , president of the world soccer association fifa .
" you can feel the emotion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sepp blatter can feel it a party , and a safe one at that the brazil-greece matchup has so far provided the best atmosphere of the tournament .
but organizers and security officials are just as happy about fans watching the other three games .
there have been no arrests so far , and not a whisper of hooligan activity - either inside or outside the stadium .
" there have no incidents worth mentioning , " said a spokesperson at the state police agency responsible for sporting event security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1,000 german soccer fans protested against what they said were overly strict security controls .
the demonstration was planned and took place ahead of the germany-australia match .
granted , many of the countries known for hooliganism - england and the netherlands , for example - are not competing in the tournament .
but the opportunity offered by the confederations cup to fine-tune germany 's security concept will help police officials by the time the world cup rolls around next year . germans doing what germans do best germany 's well-earned reputation for good organization has been on full display so far .
frankfurt 's refurbished stadium , which played host to the opening germany match against australia on wednesday , was a building site the day before kickoff .
but everything was in place by the time the referee blew the start whistle . " german thoroughness , " was blatter 's explanation . things have n't been as thorough with ticket sales - at least so far .
tournament favorites argentina played in front of only 25,000 spectators against tunisia in cologne on wednesday .
only 24,000 spectators watched japan against mexico in hanover a day later .
around 540,000 of a total 620,000 tickets have been sold , a figure below the 600,000 organizers had hoped to sell by now . but as the matches continue to win in importance , the number of spectators will grow , say officials .
one semi-final match is already sold out .
but fans can still get seats for the final . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil show otto who 's king brazil opens the confederations cup with a dominating 3-0 victory over otto rehhagel 's european champs greece .

-lrb- june 16 , 2005 -rrb- the mini-world cup kicks off hundreds of thousands of fans will follow the fortunes of eight teams at five stadiums across germany over the next two weeks .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese-born takeo ischi -lrb- left -rrb- is a world-famous yodeling artist räss , who is only 26 , comes from an alpine community and has been yodeling since she was a child .
her zurich students are coming to it later though - and they 've had to fight the idea , strong in urban switzerland , that yodeling is at best old-fashioned , at worst ridiculous . some raised eyebrows graphic designer klaudia meisterhans said she gets some raised eyebrows when she tells her friends about her hobby .
" at first they are astonished , but when i tell them about it they get very interested , " she said .
" i think it 's a pity that there are so many nice songs that people do n't know .
most people think yodeling is this commercial kind of music but there is much more . "
bildunterschrift : not all yodeling fans have to dress like german yodeling mother-daughter duo maria and margot hellwig to yodel properly , the right breathing is essential .
räss insists on breathing exercises at the start of every lesson .
this may be one of the main reasons why stressed-out zurich professionals are attracted to the course . the feel-good factor economist joseph birchmeier said the yodeling simply makes him feel good .
" very relaxed , all the stress is gone , it 's a new life , a kind of new energy , " he said , adding that he 's even taken to yodeling in the car on his way to work .
" if i sing in the morning on the way to work i 'm in a much better mood , " he said .
" that 's good for me and for my colleagues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones may have replaced yodeling as a means of communication in the alps , but the traditional music is still far more relaxing the nature of the songs is also part of the attraction .
the lyrics are about the mountains , about being at one with nature , and about not worrying too much about tomorrow .
psychologist linde brassel has spent all her life in the city , but still , the alps - and yodeling - are part of her , she said .
" well , i 'm swiss , " brassel said .
" it 's just a way to feel at home in my body and to feel joy . " imogen foulkes -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hodl-ay-ee-dee-ho !

in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .

should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .
he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .

italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .

the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .

" it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .

one ancient music style is currently taking zurich by storm . zurich 's conservatory of music has got an unexpected hit on its hands : classes in yodeling are booked solid for months to come .
what began centuries ago as a way of communicating across alpine valleys has become the new must-have experience for zurich 's professional classes and is now bringing some peace and harmony to switzerland 's biggest city .
yodeling teacher nadja räss has been overwhelmed by her success .
" it 's really nice for me , all my courses are full , people are just so happy to yodel , " she said .
" for me , that 's a great honor , because yodeling is my great love . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese-born takeo ischi -lrb- left -rrb- is a world-famous yodeling artist räss , who is only 26 , comes from an alpine community and has been yodeling since she was a child .
her zurich students are coming to it later though - and they 've had to fight the idea , strong in urban switzerland , that yodeling is at best old-fashioned , at worst ridiculous . some raised eyebrows graphic designer klaudia meisterhans said she gets some raised eyebrows when she tells her friends about her hobby .
" at first they are astonished , but when i tell them about it they get very interested , " she said .
" i think it 's a pity that there are so many nice songs that people do n't know .
most people think yodeling is this commercial kind of music but there is much more . "
bildunterschrift : not all yodeling fans have to dress like german yodeling mother-daughter duo maria and margot hellwig to yodel properly , the right breathing is essential .
räss insists on breathing exercises at the start of every lesson .
this may be one of the main reasons why stressed-out zurich professionals are attracted to the course . the feel-good factor economist joseph birchmeier said the yodeling simply makes him feel good .
" very relaxed , all the stress is gone , it 's a new life , a kind of new energy , " he said , adding that he 's even taken to yodeling in the car on his way to work .
" if i sing in the morning on the way to work i 'm in a much better mood , " he said .
" that 's good for me and for my colleagues . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones may have replaced yodeling as a means of communication in the alps , but the traditional music is still far more relaxing the nature of the songs is also part of the attraction .
the lyrics are about the mountains , about being at one with nature , and about not worrying too much about tomorrow .
psychologist linde brassel has spent all her life in the city , but still , the alps - and yodeling - are part of her , she said .
" well , i 'm swiss , " brassel said .

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .
in the 89th minute , he got that third strike when an inattentive australian defense allowed a free-kick cross from juan ramon riqulme to reach figueroa on the far post .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution . " people will tell you next that europe is not in a crisis , " luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the rotating eu presidency , said after a two-day summit ended in acrimony . " it is in a profound crisis . " fundamental differences between britain , which clung to its long-cherished 5 billion euro budget rebate , and most of its 24 eu partners proved impossible to bridge in a desperate , last-minute round of eu diplomacy friday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker tries to express his disappointment following the summit " we tried to give europe a new financial perspective .
we have failed , " a visibly disappointed and frustrated juncker said . in a bitter round of early-morning finger-pointing , nearly all participants blamed britain and the netherlands for the failure of a compromise on the 2007-2013 budget worth about 100 billion euros a year . targeting the guilty " i believe a deal would have been possible .
the fact that there was n't one is solely due to the inflexible stance of the british and the dutch , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters .
the dutch had demanded a cut in their annual budget payments , whereas britain clung stubbornly to its rebate , which is expected to grow to about 7 billion euros per year in 2007 . those who are responsible for the failure in brussels must now " stand up and answer to history and above all to the youth of europe , " admonished schröder .
" it is a bleak day for europe . " " in reality we were close to an agreement , " added an exasperated french president jacques chirac , saying he " deplored " britain 's stance . for his part , british prime minister tony blair denied being isolated by his partners at the summit table .

" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " schröder , who also tried to mediate a compromise , praised the efforts of the 10 new members as the sole " bright point " in the debate .

now if only more tickets would sell . as their team was getting dismantled on the field , greek fans in the stands at leipzig 's stadium thursday evening were slowly , but surely gaining the upper hand in the party duel against their brazilian rivals . the much-hyped syrtaki vs. samba matchup was more evident in the stands than on the pitch , where the european champions lost 0-3 to a far superior brazil side .
more than 44,000 fans , including greeks and brazilians from all over germany , filled the leipzig stadium with song , chants , and samba for most of the night .
outside , more than 15,000 partied on the street . " the international soccer family has been welcomed here , " said sepp blatter , president of the world soccer association fifa .
" you can feel the emotion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sepp blatter can feel it a party , and a safe one at that the brazil-greece matchup has so far provided the best atmosphere of the tournament .
but organizers and security officials are just as happy about fans watching the other three games .
there have been no arrests so far , and not a whisper of hooligan activity - either inside or outside the stadium .
" there have no incidents worth mentioning , " said a spokesperson at the state police agency responsible for sporting event security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1,000 german soccer fans protested against what they said were overly strict security controls .
the demonstration was planned and took place ahead of the germany-australia match .

but the opportunity offered by the confederations cup to fine-tune germany 's security concept will help police officials by the time the world cup rolls around next year . germans doing what germans do best germany 's well-earned reputation for good organization has been on full display so far .
frankfurt 's refurbished stadium , which played host to the opening germany match against australia on wednesday , was a building site the day before kickoff .
but everything was in place by the time the referee blew the start whistle . " german thoroughness , " was blatter 's explanation . things have n't been as thorough with ticket sales - at least so far .
tournament favorites argentina played in front of only 25,000 spectators against tunisia in cologne on wednesday .
only 24,000 spectators watched japan against mexico in hanover a day later .
around 540,000 of a total 620,000 tickets have been sold , a figure below the 600,000 organizers had hoped to sell by now . but as the matches continue to win in importance , the number of spectators will grow , say officials .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .

forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .
in the 89th minute , he got that third strike when an inattentive australian defense allowed a free-kick cross from juan ramon riqulme to reach figueroa on the far post .
he needed only to touch the ball to assure argentina of victory . last group match has meaning on tuesday , the two semi-finalists , germany and argentina , will meet in nuremberg to determine who wins the group and , most likely , avoid world champs brazil in the semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allowed a late goal in february and missed a chance to break the curse against world-class teams they met in düsseldorf in february and played to a 2-2 draw , thanks to a late strike by the argentinean striker hernan crespo .
he is at home for this tournament , but figueroa filled his shoes nicely against australia . germany on the other hand are hungry .
it 's been almost five years since a victory against one of the world 's top teams , a 1-0 win in wembley against england .
jürgen klinsmann has been able to put a few feathers in his cap since taking over the team that humiliated itself at the euro 2004 .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

read what eu leaders had to say about the crisis . eu council president : jean-claude juncker speaking following the break-up of negotiations : " people will tell you next that europe is not in responding to the offer from the 10 newcomer states to dig deeper into their own pockets for the sake of rescuing the compromise : " when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day . " regarding britain 's tony blair who takes over the eu presidency in two weeks : " no comment .
no opinion .
no advice " on europe 's future : " my enthusiasm for europe is crushed . " german chancellor gerhard schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
speaking at a news briefing on what could have been achieved for the 2007-2013 budget : " with the goodwill of everyone , i believe a deal would have been possible . … we have not succeeded in reaching agreement , even though a deal would have sent an important signal regarding the ability of the eu to act . " on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .
a piece has been lost from europe as a political union .
that makes me sad . " " europe has not emerged a winner , and that 's putting it very carefully . " on the role of the 10 new member states and their willingness to hold back their own demands : " there is a bright spot that shines in europe and it will light up others . " french president jacques chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
" europe is in a deep crisis , " chirac told a midnight news conference , blaming " the selfishness of two or three rich countries " for the failure . on the efforts of the 10 new members : " it was very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " speaking on britain 's role in the debate : " he -lrb- blair -rrb- wanted to keep the entirety of his check -lrb- the british rebate -rrb- . … i deplore the fact that the united kingdom refused to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of the expenses of enlargement . " summarizing the summit : " a very bad outcome for europe . " british prime minister tony blair reason for rejecting the budget compromise : " it does n't reflect the europe we need in the 21st century . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair gestures after a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
defending britain 's position : " we were not alone at the -lrb- summit -rrb- table . " " i think people know exactly what the issues are here and i do n't think they are fooled by the tactics and the maneuvers . … i hope we can move forward from here . " blair 's foreign secretary , jack straw on the crux of the debate : " it 's essentially a division between whether you want a european union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a european union that is trapped in the past .
it is not one that europe can dodge . " polish prime minister marek belka leading the initiative of the 10 member states : " it was in our interest to reach an early compromise , it was in the interest of all new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster promoting eu expansion on may 1 , 2004 on the role of the bigger members : " my proposal was a reaction to what i perceived as the selfishness of some member states .
i asked , is it all about money , if so how much ? " " the fact that we don not have a budget is not disturbing .
what is disturbing is the atmosphere in the eu . " slovenian prime minister janez jansa the budget fight showed the " new europe which emerged from expansion was not being seriously considered by the old eu members . " czech prime minister jiri paroubek " it is ridiculous and disappointing and for us new eu members absolutely incomprehensible .

ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .

for most of the match against tunisia , they obeyed his orders to a fault . then , tunisian defender wissem abdi cut down captain michael ballack in the penalty box in the 74th minute .
ballack converted the penalty , opening the scoring flood gates to make the 3-0 final stand seem much more than it really was .
" it was good that the team stayed together and fought together , " said klinsmann .
" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .

klinsmann 's team responded gamely , but could n't find the holes as tunisian defenders radhi jaidi and hatem trabelsi made things difficult for ballack , bastian schweinsteiger and company . tunisia missing final touch the second half was all tunisia , as lemerre 's " mosquitos " made good on their coach 's threat and stormed the german goal .
but it was the final touch that eluded the north africans , and ultimately doomed them . lehmann , taking kahn 's place in goal for the game , made a nice stop of a slow rolling but dangerous tap in from adel chadli in the 56th minute .
tunisia continued to press until ballack fell in the box . bildunterschrift : jens lehmann needed his entire body for the nice save the youth investment pays off freed of the burden of a tie game , germany became more aggressive following ballack 's score .

the bayern munich creative midfielder dribbled around ali boumnijel and popped the ball in from a tough angle . eight minutes later , the newly substituted mike hanke , another youngster , took a gorgeous cross from deisler in the center of the box .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .
he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .
" it is now high time , to change it to reflect the new world order . together with brazil , india and japan , germany is ready to take on more responsibility for the security in the world .

he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .

but what that means exactly in terms of corporate responsibility toward society was less clear . the president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , repeatedly reminded the politicians present that corporations should not be made the scapegoats for a disappointing economic situation as germany switches into election campaign mode .
instead of going with the flow , thumann recommended that politicians work on creating a climate of trust around business and investing . " in the long-term , corporations can only serve their communities if they are successful , " thumann said .

in the same way , said union leaders , companies that are successful are obliged to reward their workforce .

german companies need to involve themselves more in europe and do what they can to combat negative images of the eu , verheugen said . " socially responsible enterprise in germany means making sure in your own ranks , that no one achieves competitive advantage by bringing in illegal or borderline legal cheap labor from other parts of the world only to be exploited here , " verheugen said as part of his appeal to industry leaders . enterprise in the european union has to be about more than just profit maximization and getting a better position on the global market , verheugen said , adding that a strong economy is one of the fundamental ingredients of the european concept of communal living . karin kails -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de honoring family-friendly companies as the last echoes of the recent capitalism debate die out , the winners of the title " germany 's most family-friendly companies " are pioneering the principle of humane business models .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2005 security council reform : where it stands großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing the shape of global representation the so-called group of four nations - germany , india , japan and brazil - are pushing ahead for permanent seats on the un security council .
but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .

but what that means exactly in terms of corporate responsibility toward society was less clear . the president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , repeatedly reminded the politicians present that corporations should not be made the scapegoats for a disappointing economic situation as germany switches into election campaign mode .
instead of going with the flow , thumann recommended that politicians work on creating a climate of trust around business and investing . " in the long-term , corporations can only serve their communities if they are successful , " thumann said .
" business success creates and secures jobs , which is a large part of their responsibility .
it 's the best service to a community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator wears an " i 'm a deutsche bank victim " during a protest against the bank 's downsizing decision .
it 's also the duty of all corporations only to get rid of jobs in an extreme emergency , said thumann , adding that it 's up to company leaders to look for alternatives to job cuts to secure their competitive advantage .
in the same way , said union leaders , companies that are successful are obliged to reward their workforce . " when companies make profits - and we have never been against profit-making - it 's our opinion that the workers who helped to create this success should also share in it , " said jürgen peters , the head of the metal workers ' union , ig metall . speaking up for the eu but further social responsibility in geographical terms has been demanded by the eu 's commissioner for enterprise and industry , günter verheugen .

in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .

" it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .

read what eu leaders had to say about the crisis . eu council president : jean-claude juncker speaking following the break-up of negotiations : " people will tell you next that europe is not in responding to the offer from the 10 newcomer states to dig deeper into their own pockets for the sake of rescuing the compromise : " when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day . " regarding britain 's tony blair who takes over the eu presidency in two weeks : " no comment .
no opinion .
no advice " on europe 's future : " my enthusiasm for europe is crushed . " german chancellor gerhard schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
speaking at a news briefing on what could have been achieved for the 2007-2013 budget : " with the goodwill of everyone , i believe a deal would have been possible . … we have not succeeded in reaching agreement , even though a deal would have sent an important signal regarding the ability of the eu to act . " on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .
a piece has been lost from europe as a political union .
that makes me sad . " " europe has not emerged a winner , and that 's putting it very carefully . " on the role of the 10 new member states and their willingness to hold back their own demands : " there is a bright spot that shines in europe and it will light up others . " french president jacques chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
" europe is in a deep crisis , " chirac told a midnight news conference , blaming " the selfishness of two or three rich countries " for the failure . on the efforts of the 10 new members : " it was very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " speaking on britain 's role in the debate : " he -lrb- blair -rrb- wanted to keep the entirety of his check -lrb- the british rebate -rrb- . … i deplore the fact that the united kingdom refused to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of the expenses of enlargement . " summarizing the summit : " a very bad outcome for europe . " british prime minister tony blair reason for rejecting the budget compromise : " it does n't reflect the europe we need in the 21st century . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair gestures after a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
defending britain 's position : " we were not alone at the -lrb- summit -rrb- table . " " i think people know exactly what the issues are here and i do n't think they are fooled by the tactics and the maneuvers . … i hope we can move forward from here . " blair 's foreign secretary , jack straw on the crux of the debate : " it 's essentially a division between whether you want a european union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a european union that is trapped in the past .
it is not one that europe can dodge . " polish prime minister marek belka leading the initiative of the 10 member states : " it was in our interest to reach an early compromise , it was in the interest of all new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster promoting eu expansion on may 1 , 2004 on the role of the bigger members : " my proposal was a reaction to what i perceived as the selfishness of some member states .
i asked , is it all about money , if so how much ? " " the fact that we don not have a budget is not disturbing .
what is disturbing is the atmosphere in the eu . " slovenian prime minister janez jansa the budget fight showed the " new europe which emerged from expansion was not being seriously considered by the old eu members . " czech prime minister jiri paroubek " it is ridiculous and disappointing and for us new eu members absolutely incomprehensible .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .

the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .

" it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .

but opinions differ among other nations on reform of the world body . moves to expand the united nations security council have been going on for more than a decade , and many nations say the current make-up , which represents the global balance of power after world war ii , is anachronistic and does n't reflect today 's realities . but actually putting a reform plan into place for the powerful council has proven difficult , and the process has only gained momentum this year since secretary-general kofi annan made it part of his overall reform of the world body . the council now has 15 members , 10 of which rotate in for two-year terms , and five permanent members - the united states , china , britain , france and russia - which have veto power .
a proposal put forth by the group of four -lrb- g-4 -rrb- calls for expanding the council to 25 members , with six additional permanent seats , including two from africa , and four non-permanent ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group of four .
india 's prime minister manmohan singh , left , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , second from left , brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , second from right , and german vice-chancellor joschka fischer .
the g-4 nations have been lobbying hard for a vote that they hope will take place in june .
in order for their reform plan to go ahead , they will need the support of at least two-thirds of the 191-member general assembly .
if that support comes , another vote would be held to select new members .
should that resolution pass , a change in the un charter would be necessary , which would have to be approved by national legislatures . the june vote , however , is looking like it could slip into july , which has some analysts saying that could mean the g-4 will not be able to muster the support they need . who supports whom ? the united states and russia have said they support japan 's bid for a permanent seat , but have not taken a position on the other three .
us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin discussed un reform during a phone call on wednesday . the white house spokesman said the presidents agreed that the goal of security council reform should be to make the council more effective .
he added that it is important to build a broad consensus on the way forward . outlining for the first time the us position on the council 's expansion , undersecretary of state nicholas burns said thursday it " will likely support adding two or so permanent members " and " two or three " additional non-permanent seats to the council . only one of four aside from japan , he did not indicate a us preference for new membership .
earlier in the month , secretary of state condoleezza rice stated similiar goals during a meeting with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressing that washington was not ready to endorse the other three . that is a prospect japan said it would not support .
" america made a proposal but japan can not go along with it , " prime minister junichiro koizumi told reporters on friday .
he said japan was determined not to break up a joint bid with the group of four . strong chinese opposition meanwhile , china has stepped up its opposition to what it calls " hasty " un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese premier wen jiabao , left , shakes hands with united nations secretary-general kofi annan at un headquarters earlier this month , china said it would block any move to give the g-4 permanent seats , a threat that it could carry out since it holds veto power on the current council . china has said it wants increased representation by developing countries on the council and state councillor tang jiaxuan said the purpose of any reform must be to strengthen rather than weaken the un . " it will inevitably intensify the conflict among many countries if an immature plan is put to the vote or adopted , " he said at a meeting of the chinese-arab cooperation forum in beijing . beijing has urged security council members not to approve the g-4 plan , complaining that japan never properly atoned for its world war ii abuses . an imbalanced global representation ? some observers have also hinted that india might be washington 's top choice for a second permanent seat . that would mean not a single african or south american state is represented on the security council , an option that would likely inflame a good portion of the general assembly . france and britain , who are also permanent members , have said they back the four contenders .
italy , which does not have a permanent seat but as a member of the european union has a vested interest in the eu 's representation on the un 's highest body , has lobbied against germany 's inclusion and in favor of a single seat for europe and more input by developing countries . other regional rivalries that have spilled over into the security council debate include pakistan and india .
pakistan opposes india 's having a seat and has said if the general assembly ever votes on the expansion plans , " they 'll lose " based on the large contingent of muslim states that would oppose india .
secretary-general annan has said he thinks security council enlargement should take place before the world summit in september , where participants are scheduled to adopt an ambitious reform program on the un 's 60th anniversary .
the g4 states agree .
" for some 40 years the make up of the securtiy council has not changed , " said germany 's fischer .
" it is now high time , to change it to reflect the new world order . together with brazil , india and japan , germany is ready to take on more responsibility for the security in the world . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us wary of german security council bid washington has thrown a wrench into berlin ’ s aspirations of becoming a permanent member of the un security council , arguing that the expansion of the body is not its top reform priority .

but what that means exactly in terms of corporate responsibility toward society was less clear . the president of the german industry association -lrb- bdi -rrb- , jürgen thumann , repeatedly reminded the politicians present that corporations should not be made the scapegoats for a disappointing economic situation as germany switches into election campaign mode .
instead of going with the flow , thumann recommended that politicians work on creating a climate of trust around business and investing . " in the long-term , corporations can only serve their communities if they are successful , " thumann said .
" business success creates and secures jobs , which is a large part of their responsibility .
it 's the best service to a community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstrator wears an " i 'm a deutsche bank victim " during a protest against the bank 's downsizing decision .
it 's also the duty of all corporations only to get rid of jobs in an extreme emergency , said thumann , adding that it 's up to company leaders to look for alternatives to job cuts to secure their competitive advantage .
in the same way , said union leaders , companies that are successful are obliged to reward their workforce . " when companies make profits - and we have never been against profit-making - it 's our opinion that the workers who helped to create this success should also share in it , " said jürgen peters , the head of the metal workers ' union , ig metall . speaking up for the eu but further social responsibility in geographical terms has been demanded by the eu 's commissioner for enterprise and industry , günter verheugen .

australia 's " socceroos " take on tournament favorite argentina in the second match . tunisia - germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tunisia 's " mosquitoes " are ready to strike after fighting gamely against argentina in the first match , tunisia succumbed to some iffy penalty calls on behalf of referee roberto rosetti and the clear superiority of the south americans .
coach roger lemerre 's team might have an easier time against germany 's porous defense than against an argentine back four that included gabriel heinze and fabricio coloccini .
forwards jaziri and brazilian-born santos , who should start the match , will be given the task of breaking down the germans ' lumbering defense .
" our next game will be totally different from the first one , " said lemerre .
" the germans have got their big , physical ' hulks ' , but i 've got my mosquitoes .
and jaziri and santos are ready to bite . "
but will they draw any blood ? german papers have spent the two days following the team 's 4-3 opening match victory against australia 's " socceroos " savaging the team 's defense .
true , the boys - all around the age of 22 - made goalie oliver kahn look bad more often than not , but coach jürgen klinsmann said friday he saw no reason to panic ahead of his team 's game in cologne .
in fact , the coach said his midfield should be quicker in closing holes so that the opposing team does n't have the possibility of getting to his shaky defenders . bildunterschrift : the german defense made keeper kahn look bad .
as part of a rotation , klinsmann will start arsenal 's jens lehmann in goal against tunisia . one of the bright notes of the first match was germany 's offensive explosion .
and the way creative midfielder bastian schweinsteiger sees it , germany 's best defense might be a good offense .
" if we give up seven goals , and shoot eight , then it does n't really matter to me , " he said .
if schweinsteiger has his way , most of the goals will be scored by him and his team buddy and local goal-scoring hero , lukas " prince " podolski , who will be eager to impress his hometown fans . possible lineups : tunisia - fadhel - trabelsi , jaidi , abdi , clayton - ghodhbane , nafti , ben saada , mnari - santos , jaziri germany - lehmann - huth , a. friedrich , mertesacker , hitzlsperger - frings - b. schneider , schweinsteiger - ballack - kuranyi , podolski australia - argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank farina will be looking for some revenge the prospect of facing argentina again must be leaving frank farina -lrb- photo -rrb- burning with thoughts of revenge .
the australian coach 's last match as a player was a world cup qualifying playoff against the south americans in 1993 .
after playing to a tie in australia , the socceroos lost the return leg on an own goal , ending their world cup dreams .
now , as coach , he leads a competent and - as the first match showed - offensive-minded team with a good shot at giving the argentines some trouble .
farina will once again have goal-scoring threat mark viduka at his disposal after the striker missed the first game with an injury .
he does lose defender tony popovic , taken down hard by schweinsteiger , robbing him of a defensive rock against the nimble and speedy argentine attack . argentina will be looking for more of the same in their second confederations cup match .
their opening 2-1 win over tunisia was marred by a few strange calls , but the gauchos showed enough superiority to leave no doubt that they were serious about going after the trophy .
both coaches and players are cautioning against underestimating the socceroos , and the back four led by heinze will have their hands full with john aloisi , who notched two goals against germany . bildunterschrift : more of the same in round two still , the calm wizardry of playmaker jose riquelme and the quickness of striker jose saviola in the first match-up , should guarantee another argentina victory . possible lineups : australia - schwarzer - neill , mckain , moore , muscat - milicevic - chipperfield , skoko , emerton - cahill - viduka argentina - leo franco - coloccini , milito , heinze - j. zanetti , cambiasso , bernardi , sorin - riquelme - tevez , saviola dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina dominates tunisia in opener argentina played a superior game against tunisia , winning 2-1 with the help of a penalty kick and a nicely-played second goal .

the european union careened into " profound crisis " saturday as budget talks failed and a two-day summit collapsed into finger-pointing , compounding turmoil over an eu constitution .

" when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed .

read what eu leaders had to say about the crisis . eu council president : jean-claude juncker speaking following the break-up of negotiations : " people will tell you next that europe is not in responding to the offer from the 10 newcomer states to dig deeper into their own pockets for the sake of rescuing the compromise : " when i heard one after the other , all the new member countries , each poorer than the other , say that in the interest of reaching an agreement they would be ready to renounce some of their financial demands , i was ashamed . " on the future of budget talks : " during this budgetary debate there were two conceptions of europe that clashed and will always clash .
there are those who , in fact without saying it , want the big market and nothing but the big market , a high level free trade zone , and those that want a politically integrated europe . … i have felt for a long time this debate would blow up one day . " regarding britain 's tony blair who takes over the eu presidency in two weeks : " no comment .
no opinion .
no advice " on europe 's future : " my enthusiasm for europe is crushed . " german chancellor gerhard schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
speaking at a news briefing on what could have been achieved for the 2007-2013 budget : " with the goodwill of everyone , i believe a deal would have been possible . … we have not succeeded in reaching agreement , even though a deal would have sent an important signal regarding the ability of the eu to act . " on what went wrong : " the fact that there was no deal is due solely to the completely inflexible stance of the british and the dutch … britain in particular had not been prepared to compromise on its budget rebate . … with this , britain refused to make its contribution to enlargement .
that 's regrettable . " " it is not a good day for europe .
a piece has been lost from europe as a political union .
that makes me sad . " " europe has not emerged a winner , and that 's putting it very carefully . " on the role of the 10 new member states and their willingness to hold back their own demands : " there is a bright spot that shines in europe and it will light up others . " french president jacques chirac bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac during a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
" europe is in a deep crisis , " chirac told a midnight news conference , blaming " the selfishness of two or three rich countries " for the failure . on the efforts of the 10 new members : " it was very impressive compared to the egoistic position of one or two rich countries . " speaking on britain 's role in the debate : " he -lrb- blair -rrb- wanted to keep the entirety of his check -lrb- the british rebate -rrb- . … i deplore the fact that the united kingdom refused to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of the expenses of enlargement . " summarizing the summit : " a very bad outcome for europe . " british prime minister tony blair reason for rejecting the budget compromise : " it does n't reflect the europe we need in the 21st century . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair gestures after a media conference at the end of the eu summit in brussels friday june 17 , 2005 .
defending britain 's position : " we were not alone at the -lrb- summit -rrb- table . " " i think people know exactly what the issues are here and i do n't think they are fooled by the tactics and the maneuvers . … i hope we can move forward from here . " blair 's foreign secretary , jack straw on the crux of the debate : " it 's essentially a division between whether you want a european union that is able to cope with the future or whether you want a european union that is trapped in the past .
it is not one that europe can dodge . " polish prime minister marek belka leading the initiative of the 10 member states : " it was in our interest to reach an early compromise , it was in the interest of all new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poster promoting eu expansion on may 1 , 2004 on the role of the bigger members : " my proposal was a reaction to what i perceived as the selfishness of some member states .
i asked , is it all about money , if so how much ? " " the fact that we don not have a budget is not disturbing .
what is disturbing is the atmosphere in the eu . " slovenian prime minister janez jansa the budget fight showed the " new europe which emerged from expansion was not being seriously considered by the old eu members . " czech prime minister jiri paroubek " it is ridiculous and disappointing and for us new eu members absolutely incomprehensible .

" something like that gives every trainer a good feeling . " skilled on the ball before a sold out crowd of more than 44,000 at cologne 's rheinenergie stadium , the home team was doing little to augment the good vibes the sun and warm temperatures was giving the fans .

with their 4-2 victory , jose pekerman 's squad did not impress the small crowd in nuremberg . australian goalkeeper must feel jinxed at the confederations cup 2005 .
for the second match in a row , the roos keeper let in four goals .
however , not one of the goals in the 4-2 loss against argentina could be blamed on the 1.94 meter man .
" it was a bad game , " said the goalie who once played for kaiserslautern .
" i had little to do but i still had to fetch the ball from the net four times . " true .
he was hardly challenged in the match but his defense let him down so badly that he will not be buying them dinner , let alone a round of cold german beer in this cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's gabriel heinze -lrb- left -rrb- is sent flying after a challenge by australia 's tim cahill the confederations cup 2005 edition may be a disaster for goalkeepers so far -lrb- 25 goals in six matches -rrb- , but goal scorers have been able to make a name for themselves .
argentina 's luciano figueroa scored a hattrick .
when he put his side up 3-0 with his second goal in the 53rd minute , the game looked all but over .
the roos had little if any spring in their step . penalty opens the door argentina , seemingly confident of victory , then got complacent .
defender fabricio coloccini committed a foul in the penalty box that australian striker john aloisi then converted and australia were only down 3-1 . some ten minutes later , argentinean defender gabriel heinze made an indescribable mistake by using his chest to try and pass it back to keeper german lux .
the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .
in the 89th minute , he got that third strike when an inattentive australian defense allowed a free-kick cross from juan ramon riqulme to reach figueroa on the far post .
he needed only to touch the ball to assure argentina of victory . last group match has meaning on tuesday , the two semi-finalists , germany and argentina , will meet in nuremberg to determine who wins the group and , most likely , avoid world champs brazil in the semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allowed a late goal in february and missed a chance to break the curse against world-class teams they met in düsseldorf in february and played to a 2-2 draw , thanks to a late strike by the argentinean striker hernan crespo .
he is at home for this tournament , but figueroa filled his shoes nicely against australia . germany on the other hand are hungry .
it 's been almost five years since a victory against one of the world 's top teams , a 1-0 win in wembley against england .
jürgen klinsmann has been able to put a few feathers in his cap since taking over the team that humiliated itself at the euro 2004 .
the big win , along with the big feather , is missing , though .

the attempt went awry and the ball landed on the foot of aloisi who only had to lift the ball over the helpless lux .
it was aloisi fourth goal in the tournament , making him the best in the tournament all of a sudden , it was 3-2 and 20 minutes were remaining . bildunterschrift : australia 's john aloisi -lrb- right -rrb- scores his side 's first goal from the penalty spot argentina began to look nervous .
australia could smell the equalizer in the air of the two-thirds full franken stadium in nuremberg .
yet the ingenuity on their part and the generosity on the argentinean 's part was lacking . " i never thought that they would be able to turn the game around , " were the thoughts of three-goal scorer figeuroa .
in the 89th minute , he got that third strike when an inattentive australian defense allowed a free-kick cross from juan ramon riqulme to reach figueroa on the far post .
he needed only to touch the ball to assure argentina of victory . last group match has meaning on tuesday , the two semi-finalists , germany and argentina , will meet in nuremberg to determine who wins the group and , most likely , avoid world champs brazil in the semi-final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany allowed a late goal in february and missed a chance to break the curse against world-class teams they met in düsseldorf in february and played to a 2-2 draw , thanks to a late strike by the argentinean striker hernan crespo .
he is at home for this tournament , but figueroa filled his shoes nicely against australia . germany on the other hand are hungry .
it 's been almost five years since a victory against one of the world 's top teams , a 1-0 win in wembley against england .
jürgen klinsmann has been able to put a few feathers in his cap since taking over the team that humiliated itself at the euro 2004 .

ms rice will meet both israeli prime minister ariel sharon and mr abbas to ensure everything is going according to plan .
she has already assigned us army general " kip " ward to help the palestinians reform their security services - vital if militant groups are to be kept under control .

in other words , she is going to tell them to embrace democracy .

labour mp jeff ennis has tabled a motion that has now been supported by a total of 47 mps .
a poll conducted last year for the bbc found that four out of five people backed lifting the legal age to 18 .
the health department said there were now fewer young people smoking , compared to seven years ago . "
we are taking all these measures to crack down on smoking in public places , yet we still allow 16-year-olds to buy cigarettes " jeff ennis public back age change mr ennis , the mp for barnsley east and mexborough , said he decided to table the motion after discovering that ministers had no plans to raise the minimum age .
" i thought it was something that we definitely ought to be considering doing .
i think it 's an issue that is of public concern , " he said .
he said it would make sense for the age at which someone can buy tobacco to match that at which alcohol can be legally bought .
he said that , with current moves towards other restrictions on smoking and other curbs on what teenagers are allowed to buy , it was " a nonsense " to leave the minimum age for tobacco at 16 .
" we are taking all these measures to crack down on smoking in public places , yet we still allow 16-year-olds to buy cigarettes .
" we are stopping 16-year-olds from buying knives and we should be doing our best to stop them from buying cigarettes . "
' fewer smoking ' the public health white paper , published in the autumn , set out a timetable to ensure all public places , except pubs which do not serve food , are smoke-free by 2008 .
legislation to introduce such a ban was included in the queen 's speech in may .
a spokesman for the department of health said the rate of smoking among 11 to 15 year olds had fallen to 9 % , from 13 % in 1998 .
he said that while more needed to be done , the drop showed the government 's strategies on smoking were working .
in the icm poll carried out for the bbc last august , most people said raising the age at which teenagers could buy cigarettes would deter young people from starting to smoke .
of the 1,010 adults surveyed , 55 % said the minimum age should go up to 21 .
nine out of 10 supported increasing the penalties for selling tobacco to children .

its origins date from the 17th century battle for supremacy between protestantism and catholicism .
prince william of orange , originally of the netherlands , led the fight against catholic king james .
he eventually took the throne in england and his final victory over james at the battle of the boyne in ireland in 1690 , sealed the religion 's supremacy in the british isles .
in 1795 , a clash between protestants and catholics at the battle of the diamond near loughgall , county armagh , led to some of those involved to swear a new oath to uphold the protestant faith and be loyal to the king and his heirs , giving birth to the orange order .
since then , the order 's principles and aims , and those of similar organisations it is related to , have changed little .
criteria it regards itself as defending civil and religious liberties of protestants and seeks to uphold the rule and ascendancy of a protestant monarch in the united kingdom .
the only membership criteria is that an applicant is protestant .
the order is organised into " lodges " .
lodges are created where and when members wish to set them up - sir james craig , northern ireland 's first prime minister , established a lodge at the house of commons and there have been many linked to british military postings .
orangeism is also active in former british colonies - principally canada , new zealand , australia and the two west african countries of togo and ghana .
twelfth of july is climax of the marching season the annual 12 july " demonstrations " across northern ireland , the most important date in the orange calendar , commemorate that victory at the boyne .
at the heart of orangeism is the right to parade - and the argument about what those parades stand for .
orangemen and women say that the parades are intrinsically linked to their culture and community , be it a public statement of faith , a commemoration of those who gave their lives in war or the annual twelfth of july festivities .
they stress that for decades there was no dispute from the catholic community over routes and timings of parades .
opponents of the organisation say the parades stand for bigotry and sectarianism and symbolise a northern ireland organised to uphold the rights of only one part of the population .
parades they argue that opposition to parades has grown as the catholic community has asserted its right not to be subjected to the whims of one section of the community .
the orange order has never been simply a religious organisation .
when the home rule movement emerged in the 19th century , the orange order steadily moved towards the unionist position .
the organisation opposed home rule and partition but concluded that the newly created northern ireland would be the defender of its cultural , civil and religious rights .
the first unionist members of parliament were drawn from the ranks of the loyal orders .
dispute over drumcree parade has made world headlines almost every minister in the northern ireland government from 1921 until the imposition of direct rule in 1972 was an orangeman .
as the violence of the troubles deepened , the orange order supported the security forces against republican terrorism and its members opposed any political agreement seen as ceding ground to republicans or giving dublin a say in northern ireland affairs .
during the early 1990s , republicans began attacking rural orange halls , particularly in county armagh , raising fears among the organisation that its members were threatened with being forced out of areas .
but at the same time , the orange order was faced with some members displaying an ambiguous relationship towards loyalist paramilitaries and their activities .
dispute the orange order has had historic links with the ulster unionist party .
in previous years , it sent about 100 delegates to meetings of the party 's ruling council .
however , in march 2005 the orange order formally cut its links with the party , ending 100 years of ties .
the order said because of restructuring within the ulster unionist party , it would have to make " impracticable changes " to its constitution .
the decision to reject the good friday agreement had placed the organisation closer to ian paisley 's dup than the pro-agreement ulster unionists and led to some members questioning whether or not the institution had become too political .
last year 's march in portadown passed off peacefully nowhere was this polarisation seen more than at drumcree in portadown .
the route of the march , one of the oldest annual parades by the order , took on a symbolic meaning for both communities out of all proportion with its actual importance .
the drumcree dispute has not only put the organisation at loggerheads with the catholic community - but also with the forces of law and order which it , ironically , saw as one of its closest allies .
in 2000 , one senior orange figure said that the order was losing moderate members because it was increasingly dominated by politics , " ignorance and malevolence " .
images of protesters blocking traffic while brandishing orange regalia with loyalist paramilitary figures in the background were causing a drift away from the order , he said .
other members traced the change to the summer of 1998 when some of the worst violence associated with drumcree was witnessed .

its origins date from the 17th century battle for supremacy between protestantism and catholicism .
prince william of orange , originally of the netherlands , led the fight against catholic king james .
he eventually took the throne in england and his final victory over james at the battle of the boyne in ireland in 1690 , sealed the religion 's supremacy in the british isles .
in 1795 , a clash between protestants and catholics at the battle of the diamond near loughgall , county armagh , led to some of those involved to swear a new oath to uphold the protestant faith and be loyal to the king and his heirs , giving birth to the orange order .
since then , the order 's principles and aims , and those of similar organisations it is related to , have changed little .
criteria it regards itself as defending civil and religious liberties of protestants and seeks to uphold the rule and ascendancy of a protestant monarch in the united kingdom .
the only membership criteria is that an applicant is protestant .
the order is organised into " lodges " .
lodges are created where and when members wish to set them up - sir james craig , northern ireland 's first prime minister , established a lodge at the house of commons and there have been many linked to british military postings .
orangeism is also active in former british colonies - principally canada , new zealand , australia and the two west african countries of togo and ghana .
twelfth of july is climax of the marching season the annual 12 july " demonstrations " across northern ireland , the most important date in the orange calendar , commemorate that victory at the boyne .
at the heart of orangeism is the right to parade - and the argument about what those parades stand for .
orangemen and women say that the parades are intrinsically linked to their culture and community , be it a public statement of faith , a commemoration of those who gave their lives in war or the annual twelfth of july festivities .
they stress that for decades there was no dispute from the catholic community over routes and timings of parades .
opponents of the organisation say the parades stand for bigotry and sectarianism and symbolise a northern ireland organised to uphold the rights of only one part of the population .
parades they argue that opposition to parades has grown as the catholic community has asserted its right not to be subjected to the whims of one section of the community .
the orange order has never been simply a religious organisation .
when the home rule movement emerged in the 19th century , the orange order steadily moved towards the unionist position .
the organisation opposed home rule and partition but concluded that the newly created northern ireland would be the defender of its cultural , civil and religious rights .
the first unionist members of parliament were drawn from the ranks of the loyal orders .
dispute over drumcree parade has made world headlines almost every minister in the northern ireland government from 1921 until the imposition of direct rule in 1972 was an orangeman .
as the violence of the troubles deepened , the orange order supported the security forces against republican terrorism and its members opposed any political agreement seen as ceding ground to republicans or giving dublin a say in northern ireland affairs .
during the early 1990s , republicans began attacking rural orange halls , particularly in county armagh , raising fears among the organisation that its members were threatened with being forced out of areas .
but at the same time , the orange order was faced with some members displaying an ambiguous relationship towards loyalist paramilitaries and their activities .
dispute the orange order has had historic links with the ulster unionist party .
in previous years , it sent about 100 delegates to meetings of the party 's ruling council .
however , in march 2005 the orange order formally cut its links with the party , ending 100 years of ties .
the order said because of restructuring within the ulster unionist party , it would have to make " impracticable changes " to its constitution .
the decision to reject the good friday agreement had placed the organisation closer to ian paisley 's dup than the pro-agreement ulster unionists and led to some members questioning whether or not the institution had become too political .
last year 's march in portadown passed off peacefully nowhere was this polarisation seen more than at drumcree in portadown .
the route of the march , one of the oldest annual parades by the order , took on a symbolic meaning for both communities out of all proportion with its actual importance .
the drumcree dispute has not only put the organisation at loggerheads with the catholic community - but also with the forces of law and order which it , ironically , saw as one of its closest allies .
in 2000 , one senior orange figure said that the order was losing moderate members because it was increasingly dominated by politics , " ignorance and malevolence " .
images of protesters blocking traffic while brandishing orange regalia with loyalist paramilitary figures in the background were causing a drift away from the order , he said .

vodafone said it had legal permission to build on the site but could give no assurances when work would start .
but despite the all night presence of the protestors , no contractors appeared on saturday to start work .
the campaigners have said they now intend to have a constant presence on the protest line .
they are objecting to the mast on health grounds and have said that they are seeking a judicial review over the plans .

" there are a number of issues which we want to see resolved before any work begins , " she said .
masts have proved controversial across the uk " we are concerned about several things including the health issues of putting a mast on a site which is close to residential properties .
" we just want these matters sorted out before any preparatory work takes place . "
she said that since the first protest on 6 june where residents prevented contractors from entering the site of the planned mast , they have maintained a continued presence at the site .
