barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .

german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .

" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .

" there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .
anyone who has made his election decision should not subject himself to this and switch off the tv . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of an " angie " poster a poll released on monday showed that a coalition of the christian democrats and their preferred partners , the free democrats , would score a combined 48 percent , just short of the 48.5 percent necessary for a governing majority . yet an alliance of the social democrats , the greens and the left party would amass a winning 49 percent , according to the forsa poll for stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld " one of the issues we 'll have to wrestle with is the reality that while a number of nato nations been reducing the restrictions that they impose on their forces ... some nations have not yet done that , " he said .
complaints about caveats although he identified no country by name , rumsfeld alluded to an incident last year in kosovo in which german nato troops failed to respond to a serious outbreak of ethnic unrest because of their national rules of engagement .
he complained that so-called national caveats - restrictions that governments place on the use of their forces in nato missions - are so numerous it takes 17 pages to list them all .
nato has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to afghanistan 's first parliamentary elections in three decades next weekend , which has seen a surge in violence across the country .
britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan .
german opposition german defense minister peter struck , hosting the berlin talks , stressed his country 's opposition to a merger the two missions tuesday .
bildunterschrift : peter struck greeting afghan soldiers in kunduz , where german isaf soldiers are stationed . "
i do n't want our soldiers to face further dangers if these two mandates are linked to each other , " he told rbb radio in berlin rumsfeld also said the us wants nato to develop new roles as well as straight peacekeeping " it would be nice if nato developed counter terrorism capabilities .. which do n't exist at the present time as a nato function , " he said .
new strategy needed at the same time afghan president hamid karzai urged the us and other world leaders to reconsider the strategy for fighting terrorism in the war-torn country , saying there should be a focus on the " sources of terrorism . "
" we and the international community , the coalition , must sit down and reconsider and re-think whether the approach to the threat of terrorism that has -lrb- been -rrb- taken is the absolutely right one , " he told the bbc .
the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
" we need a .. new road map for how the international community can work together in support of the afghan government , " he said , while stressing that no formal decisions were expected at the berlin talks . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2005 german election enters final phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators believe the campaign is turning into a circus with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition . with polls showing the conservative opposition 's once commanding lead eroding , the possibility is growing that sunday 's election will produce an awkward marriage of schröder 's social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats . neither party wants such an outcome and , in their last face-to-face meeting before the election , their leaders insisted on monday their respective coalitions would win . " there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .
anyone who has made his election decision should not subject himself to this and switch off the tv . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of an " angie " poster a poll released on monday showed that a coalition of the christian democrats and their preferred partners , the free democrats , would score a combined 48 percent , just short of the 48.5 percent necessary for a governing majority . yet an alliance of the social democrats , the greens and the left party would amass a winning 49 percent , according to the forsa poll for stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers .

" it might not be an obvious medium to extoll the excitement of football culture , but the organizers of fifa 's world cup 2006 official artistic and cultural program nonetheless felt the oratorio was ideally suited to conveying the full furor of a soccer match - and they wasted no time entrusting celebrity composer moritz eggert with the job . high-brow culture for the masses based on music by eggert and a libretto by michael klaus , the result premiered at the ruhrtriennale festival of music , literature , theater and dance in north-rhine westphalia last weekend to a rapturous reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the recitative parts peformed by some of germany 's best actors , including joachim krol and peter lohmeyer -lrb- who starred in germany 's box office hit " the miracle of berne " about germany 's legendary world cup win in 1954 -rrb- , and an ensemble starring baritone thomas e. bauer and tenor corby welch , the oratorio was a heady meeting of high-brow and pedestrian culture . while members of the audience sported classic evening wear teamed with borussia dortmund scarves and schalke jerseys , the choir did its best impression of fans in the stalls , waving banners , blowing on whistles and roaring the requisite soccer chants with all the gravitas of a greek chorus . the drama of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggert and klaus have said the piece draws on childhood memories , soccer battle cries , players ' careers , famous managers ' monologues , immortal phrases from players and coaches - such as the hot-headed giovanni trappatoni -lrb- photo -rrb- , known in germany for his impassioned tirades while in charge of bayern - medical diagnoses of injuries on the pitch as well as famous quotations - whether from the stands , the bench , the pitch or from interviews .
it might be a show steeped in allusions to mozart , richard strauß and wagner - who admittedly knew a thing or two about dramatic effect - but many soccer fans would no doubt agree that nothing can beat the real thing . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gods and hooligans clash in soccer opera ancient goddesses selling beer , soccer-mad trojans and greeks fighting in the stands and the struggle between good and evil are all part of an opera aimed at highlighting the problem of racism and violence in stadiums .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .

rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .
" all nations agree that isaf and oef need to work more closely together , and that when nato takes over operations throughout the country that there must be unity of command , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld " one of the issues we 'll have to wrestle with is the reality that while a number of nato nations been reducing the restrictions that they impose on their forces ... some nations have not yet done that , " he said .
complaints about caveats although he identified no country by name , rumsfeld alluded to an incident last year in kosovo in which german nato troops failed to respond to a serious outbreak of ethnic unrest because of their national rules of engagement .
he complained that so-called national caveats - restrictions that governments place on the use of their forces in nato missions - are so numerous it takes 17 pages to list them all .
nato has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to afghanistan 's first parliamentary elections in three decades next weekend , which has seen a surge in violence across the country .
britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan .
german opposition german defense minister peter struck , hosting the berlin talks , stressed his country 's opposition to a merger the two missions tuesday .
bildunterschrift : peter struck greeting afghan soldiers in kunduz , where german isaf soldiers are stationed . "
i do n't want our soldiers to face further dangers if these two mandates are linked to each other , " he told rbb radio in berlin rumsfeld also said the us wants nato to develop new roles as well as straight peacekeeping " it would be nice if nato developed counter terrorism capabilities .. which do n't exist at the present time as a nato function , " he said .
new strategy needed at the same time afghan president hamid karzai urged the us and other world leaders to reconsider the strategy for fighting terrorism in the war-torn country , saying there should be a focus on the " sources of terrorism . "
" we and the international community , the coalition , must sit down and reconsider and re-think whether the approach to the threat of terrorism that has -lrb- been -rrb- taken is the absolutely right one , " he told the bbc .
the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .
" we need a .. new road map for how the international community can work together in support of the afghan government , " he said , while stressing that no formal decisions were expected at the berlin talks . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

the fair , which is scheduled to be officially opened by chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , opened its doors to the press on monday . carmakers are hoping to harness rising demand and wow consumers with a surge of new models . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker and currently in the middle of massive restructuring , plans to launch five to 10 new models by 2010 , said the head of the vw brand , wolfgang bernhard .
despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers . " we 're not expecting a deterioration in end-user prices in 2006 , " panke said , adding that bmw itself was pencilling in full-year sales growth of 9 percent this year . troubled daimlerchrysler also smiling german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler was also optimistic , with the group 's chairman-designate dieter zetsche expressing confidence that the situation at the loss-making smart unit , which has pulled down earnings in the whole mercedes division , could be turned around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , scheduled to take over from jürgen schrempp as daimlerchrysler 's chief executive from january , was put in charge of the troubled mercedes car group , which comprises the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands , with effect from sept .
1 . he was pursuing his duties there " wholeheartedly and with great pleasure " and would stay on for " an unlimited period , " he said . mercedes , previously the cash cow of the daimlerchrysler group , has hit a rough patch and recently embarked on a program of belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting costs by 3 to 4 billion euros by 2007 . all in all , around 1,000 exhibitors from 44 countries were presenting their wares at this year 's iaa , with around 80 new models to be aired for the first time .
appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .
organizers vda said around one million visitors were expected to attend the fair , the same number as at the last iaa two years ago .
industry visitors would be allowed in from thursday and then the general public would be admitted from saturday until sept .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

" there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .
anyone who has made his election decision should not subject himself to this and switch off the tv . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of an " angie " poster a poll released on monday showed that a coalition of the christian democrats and their preferred partners , the free democrats , would score a combined 48 percent , just short of the 48.5 percent necessary for a governing majority . yet an alliance of the social democrats , the greens and the left party would amass a winning 49 percent , according to the forsa poll for stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

" there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent .

featuring choral singing and a storyline but not much else - no staging , no costuming - it 's a musical form geared to weighty subject matter such as the creation of the world or the life of a biblical prophet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as any fan can tell you , soccer is a weighty subject . taking in the full gamut of human emotion - hope , disappointment , euphoria , anguish , you name it - it features protagonists who can be anything from heroic to tragic and a readymade chorus in the form of the spectators . and those elements , more or less , fit the requirements for an oratorio , which is defined as " a musical composition for voices and orchestra that tells a sacred story . " it might not be an obvious medium to extoll the excitement of football culture , but the organizers of fifa 's world cup 2006 official artistic and cultural program nonetheless felt the oratorio was ideally suited to conveying the full furor of a soccer match - and they wasted no time entrusting celebrity composer moritz eggert with the job . high-brow culture for the masses based on music by eggert and a libretto by michael klaus , the result premiered at the ruhrtriennale festival of music , literature , theater and dance in north-rhine westphalia last weekend to a rapturous reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the recitative parts peformed by some of germany 's best actors , including joachim krol and peter lohmeyer -lrb- who starred in germany 's box office hit " the miracle of berne " about germany 's legendary world cup win in 1954 -rrb- , and an ensemble starring baritone thomas e. bauer and tenor corby welch , the oratorio was a heady meeting of high-brow and pedestrian culture . while members of the audience sported classic evening wear teamed with borussia dortmund scarves and schalke jerseys , the choir did its best impression of fans in the stalls , waving banners , blowing on whistles and roaring the requisite soccer chants with all the gravitas of a greek chorus . the drama of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggert and klaus have said the piece draws on childhood memories , soccer battle cries , players ' careers , famous managers ' monologues , immortal phrases from players and coaches - such as the hot-headed giovanni trappatoni -lrb- photo -rrb- , known in germany for his impassioned tirades while in charge of bayern - medical diagnoses of injuries on the pitch as well as famous quotations - whether from the stands , the bench , the pitch or from interviews .
it might be a show steeped in allusions to mozart , richard strauß and wagner - who admittedly knew a thing or two about dramatic effect - but many soccer fans would no doubt agree that nothing can beat the real thing . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gods and hooligans clash in soccer opera ancient goddesses selling beer , soccer-mad trojans and greeks fighting in the stands and the struggle between good and evil are all part of an opera aimed at highlighting the problem of racism and violence in stadiums .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .
" all nations agree that isaf and oef need to work more closely together , and that when nato takes over operations throughout the country that there must be unity of command , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld " one of the issues we 'll have to wrestle with is the reality that while a number of nato nations been reducing the restrictions that they impose on their forces ... some nations have not yet done that , " he said .
complaints about caveats although he identified no country by name , rumsfeld alluded to an incident last year in kosovo in which german nato troops failed to respond to a serious outbreak of ethnic unrest because of their national rules of engagement .
he complained that so-called national caveats - restrictions that governments place on the use of their forces in nato missions - are so numerous it takes 17 pages to list them all .
nato has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to afghanistan 's first parliamentary elections in three decades next weekend , which has seen a surge in violence across the country .
britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan .

new strategy needed at the same time afghan president hamid karzai urged the us and other world leaders to reconsider the strategy for fighting terrorism in the war-torn country , saying there should be a focus on the " sources of terrorism . "
" we and the international community , the coalition , must sit down and reconsider and re-think whether the approach to the threat of terrorism that has -lrb- been -rrb- taken is the absolutely right one , " he told the bbc .
the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2005 german election enters final phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators believe the campaign is turning into a circus with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition . with polls showing the conservative opposition 's once commanding lead eroding , the possibility is growing that sunday 's election will produce an awkward marriage of schröder 's social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats . neither party wants such an outcome and , in their last face-to-face meeting before the election , their leaders insisted on monday their respective coalitions would win . " there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .
anyone who has made his election decision should not subject himself to this and switch off the tv . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of an " angie " poster a poll released on monday showed that a coalition of the christian democrats and their preferred partners , the free democrats , would score a combined 48 percent , just short of the 48.5 percent necessary for a governing majority . yet an alliance of the social democrats , the greens and the left party would amass a winning 49 percent , according to the forsa poll for stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .
merkel 's finance minister strategy backfires paul kirchhof , the finance expert that angela merkel tapped as possible finance minister , has become a dangerous liability that could cost the conservatives victory , observers said monday .

12 , 2005 -rrb- schröder confident of election victory surging in recent opinion polls , german chancellor gerhard schröder believes the tide has turned in his favor one week ahead of an election he was widely expected to lose against conservative challenger angela merkel .

but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .
" he is the best player in the world even with -lrb- zinedine -rrb- zidane and ronaldo .
" but it is important we do not underestimate the rest of the team . " french international playmaker ludovic giuly and portuguese ace deco provide laser-like passes for the pacy cameroon striker samuel eto 'o , who operates as a lone target-man .
eto 'o scored both goals in the 2-0 win over mallorca on sunday , but manager frank rijkaard believes his team is not in full flow . " i saw some promising moments but we are still not on top of our game , " said rijkaard . klose in the stands bremen may be anxious about barcelona 's attacking threat , but the spaniards should be wary too after the german team crushed kaiserslautern 5-1 on saturday .
german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .
" the boys will pull it off without me though . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez -lrb- photo -rrb- , normally used as a supersub , is poised to deputize and has had time to prepare .
" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .
last season bremen defeated valencia home and away in the group stage .
but the germans wo n't be able to rest on their laurels since barcelona are a step above their spanish neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2005 german election enters final phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators believe the campaign is turning into a circus with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition . with polls showing the conservative opposition 's once commanding lead eroding , the possibility is growing that sunday 's election will produce an awkward marriage of schröder 's social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats . neither party wants such an outcome and , in their last face-to-face meeting before the election , their leaders insisted on monday their respective coalitions would win . " there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .
anyone who has made his election decision should not subject himself to this and switch off the tv . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of an " angie " poster a poll released on monday showed that a coalition of the christian democrats and their preferred partners , the free democrats , would score a combined 48 percent , just short of the 48.5 percent necessary for a governing majority . yet an alliance of the social democrats , the greens and the left party would amass a winning 49 percent , according to the forsa poll for stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself .

" whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2005 german election enters final phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators believe the campaign is turning into a circus with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition . with polls showing the conservative opposition 's once commanding lead eroding , the possibility is growing that sunday 's election will produce an awkward marriage of schröder 's social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats . neither party wants such an outcome and , in their last face-to-face meeting before the election , their leaders insisted on monday their respective coalitions would win . " there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .

trittin , whose relationship with car makers has never been an easy one , criticized the auto industry for continuing to produce fuel-guzzling models that few people wanted .
" my interest is that the german auto industry remain competitive , " trittin said in an interview published in süddeutsche zeitung .
" it can do so by making fuel-saving cars , not big fuel-guzzlers that the market does n't want . "
he also pointed the finger at volkswagen chairman bernd pischetsrieder and vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech .
" here are two people who are responsible for the fact that 10,000 vw employees are about to lose their jobs , " trittin said .
" at a time when china is introducing upper limits for fuel consumption and only gas-powered taxis are only allowed in new delhi , vw is rolling out a bugatti that guzzles 100 litres of fuel .
that 's a mistake that encapsulates the essence of the crisis at vw . "
trittin complained that he had ordered a diesel-driven audi , vw 's luxury brand , but that it could not be delivered until october .
" perhaps i should have just taken a french model , " he said . dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

trittin , whose relationship with car makers has never been an easy one , criticized the auto industry for continuing to produce fuel-guzzling models that few people wanted .
" my interest is that the german auto industry remain competitive , " trittin said in an interview published in süddeutsche zeitung .
" it can do so by making fuel-saving cars , not big fuel-guzzlers that the market does n't want . "
he also pointed the finger at volkswagen chairman bernd pischetsrieder and vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech .
" here are two people who are responsible for the fact that 10,000 vw employees are about to lose their jobs , " trittin said .
" at a time when china is introducing upper limits for fuel consumption and only gas-powered taxis are only allowed in new delhi , vw is rolling out a bugatti that guzzles 100 litres of fuel .
that 's a mistake that encapsulates the essence of the crisis at vw . "
trittin complained that he had ordered a diesel-driven audi , vw 's luxury brand , but that it could not be delivered until october .
" perhaps i should have just taken a french model , " he said . dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .
" he is the best player in the world even with -lrb- zinedine -rrb- zidane and ronaldo .
" but it is important we do not underestimate the rest of the team . " french international playmaker ludovic giuly and portuguese ace deco provide laser-like passes for the pacy cameroon striker samuel eto 'o , who operates as a lone target-man .
eto 'o scored both goals in the 2-0 win over mallorca on sunday , but manager frank rijkaard believes his team is not in full flow . " i saw some promising moments but we are still not on top of our game , " said rijkaard . klose in the stands bremen may be anxious about barcelona 's attacking threat , but the spaniards should be wary too after the german team crushed kaiserslautern 5-1 on saturday .
german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .
" the boys will pull it off without me though . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez -lrb- photo -rrb- , normally used as a supersub , is poised to deputize and has had time to prepare .
" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .
last season bremen defeated valencia home and away in the group stage .

trittin , whose relationship with car makers has never been an easy one , criticized the auto industry for continuing to produce fuel-guzzling models that few people wanted .
" my interest is that the german auto industry remain competitive , " trittin said in an interview published in süddeutsche zeitung .
" it can do so by making fuel-saving cars , not big fuel-guzzlers that the market does n't want . "
he also pointed the finger at volkswagen chairman bernd pischetsrieder and vw 's supervisory board chief ferdinand piech .
" here are two people who are responsible for the fact that 10,000 vw employees are about to lose their jobs , " trittin said .
" at a time when china is introducing upper limits for fuel consumption and only gas-powered taxis are only allowed in new delhi , vw is rolling out a bugatti that guzzles 100 litres of fuel .
that 's a mistake that encapsulates the essence of the crisis at vw . "
trittin complained that he had ordered a diesel-driven audi , vw 's luxury brand , but that it could not be delivered until october .
" perhaps i should have just taken a french model , " he said . dw-world.de industry seeks changes to green policies in the wake of rising energy costs and a lackluster economy , the german chamber of commerce says that it 's time to reevaluate germany 's environmental protection policies .

featuring choral singing and a storyline but not much else - no staging , no costuming - it 's a musical form geared to weighty subject matter such as the creation of the world or the life of a biblical prophet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as any fan can tell you , soccer is a weighty subject . taking in the full gamut of human emotion - hope , disappointment , euphoria , anguish , you name it - it features protagonists who can be anything from heroic to tragic and a readymade chorus in the form of the spectators . and those elements , more or less , fit the requirements for an oratorio , which is defined as " a musical composition for voices and orchestra that tells a sacred story . " it might not be an obvious medium to extoll the excitement of football culture , but the organizers of fifa 's world cup 2006 official artistic and cultural program nonetheless felt the oratorio was ideally suited to conveying the full furor of a soccer match - and they wasted no time entrusting celebrity composer moritz eggert with the job . high-brow culture for the masses based on music by eggert and a libretto by michael klaus , the result premiered at the ruhrtriennale festival of music , literature , theater and dance in north-rhine westphalia last weekend to a rapturous reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the recitative parts peformed by some of germany 's best actors , including joachim krol and peter lohmeyer -lrb- who starred in germany 's box office hit " the miracle of berne " about germany 's legendary world cup win in 1954 -rrb- , and an ensemble starring baritone thomas e. bauer and tenor corby welch , the oratorio was a heady meeting of high-brow and pedestrian culture . while members of the audience sported classic evening wear teamed with borussia dortmund scarves and schalke jerseys , the choir did its best impression of fans in the stalls , waving banners , blowing on whistles and roaring the requisite soccer chants with all the gravitas of a greek chorus . the drama of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggert and klaus have said the piece draws on childhood memories , soccer battle cries , players ' careers , famous managers ' monologues , immortal phrases from players and coaches - such as the hot-headed giovanni trappatoni -lrb- photo -rrb- , known in germany for his impassioned tirades while in charge of bayern - medical diagnoses of injuries on the pitch as well as famous quotations - whether from the stands , the bench , the pitch or from interviews .
it might be a show steeped in allusions to mozart , richard strauß and wagner - who admittedly knew a thing or two about dramatic effect - but many soccer fans would no doubt agree that nothing can beat the real thing . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gods and hooligans clash in soccer opera ancient goddesses selling beer , soccer-mad trojans and greeks fighting in the stands and the struggle between good and evil are all part of an opera aimed at highlighting the problem of racism and violence in stadiums .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .
" all nations agree that isaf and oef need to work more closely together , and that when nato takes over operations throughout the country that there must be unity of command , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld " one of the issues we 'll have to wrestle with is the reality that while a number of nato nations been reducing the restrictions that they impose on their forces ... some nations have not yet done that , " he said .
complaints about caveats although he identified no country by name , rumsfeld alluded to an incident last year in kosovo in which german nato troops failed to respond to a serious outbreak of ethnic unrest because of their national rules of engagement .
he complained that so-called national caveats - restrictions that governments place on the use of their forces in nato missions - are so numerous it takes 17 pages to list them all .
nato has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to afghanistan 's first parliamentary elections in three decades next weekend , which has seen a surge in violence across the country .

new strategy needed at the same time afghan president hamid karzai urged the us and other world leaders to reconsider the strategy for fighting terrorism in the war-torn country , saying there should be a focus on the " sources of terrorism . "
" we and the international community , the coalition , must sit down and reconsider and re-think whether the approach to the threat of terrorism that has -lrb- been -rrb- taken is the absolutely right one , " he told the bbc .
the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .
" all nations agree that isaf and oef need to work more closely together , and that when nato takes over operations throughout the country that there must be unity of command , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld " one of the issues we 'll have to wrestle with is the reality that while a number of nato nations been reducing the restrictions that they impose on their forces ... some nations have not yet done that , " he said .
complaints about caveats although he identified no country by name , rumsfeld alluded to an incident last year in kosovo in which german nato troops failed to respond to a serious outbreak of ethnic unrest because of their national rules of engagement .
he complained that so-called national caveats - restrictions that governments place on the use of their forces in nato missions - are so numerous it takes 17 pages to list them all .
nato has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to afghanistan 's first parliamentary elections in three decades next weekend , which has seen a surge in violence across the country .
britain , canada and the netherlands are to lead the move into the south , joining some 18,000 us soldiers who have long been fighting al qaeda and taliban fighters , in particular along the eastern border with pakistan .
german opposition german defense minister peter struck , hosting the berlin talks , stressed his country 's opposition to a merger the two missions tuesday .
bildunterschrift : peter struck greeting afghan soldiers in kunduz , where german isaf soldiers are stationed . "
i do n't want our soldiers to face further dangers if these two mandates are linked to each other , " he told rbb radio in berlin rumsfeld also said the us wants nato to develop new roles as well as straight peacekeeping " it would be nice if nato developed counter terrorism capabilities .. which do n't exist at the present time as a nato function , " he said .
new strategy needed at the same time afghan president hamid karzai urged the us and other world leaders to reconsider the strategy for fighting terrorism in the war-torn country , saying there should be a focus on the " sources of terrorism . "
" we and the international community , the coalition , must sit down and reconsider and re-think whether the approach to the threat of terrorism that has -lrb- been -rrb- taken is the absolutely right one , " he told the bbc .
the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .

germany was also criticized for its strict labor laws that inhibit the creation of new jobs .

countries ahead of germany included singapore , the us , canada , norway , denmark , britain , ireland , finland , sweden , switzerland and belgium . dw-world.de the east catches up a recent study of german cities confirms that the country ’ s economic powerhouses are concentrated in the west .

appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .

featuring choral singing and a storyline but not much else - no staging , no costuming - it 's a musical form geared to weighty subject matter such as the creation of the world or the life of a biblical prophet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as any fan can tell you , soccer is a weighty subject . taking in the full gamut of human emotion - hope , disappointment , euphoria , anguish , you name it - it features protagonists who can be anything from heroic to tragic and a readymade chorus in the form of the spectators . and those elements , more or less , fit the requirements for an oratorio , which is defined as " a musical composition for voices and orchestra that tells a sacred story . " it might not be an obvious medium to extoll the excitement of football culture , but the organizers of fifa 's world cup 2006 official artistic and cultural program nonetheless felt the oratorio was ideally suited to conveying the full furor of a soccer match - and they wasted no time entrusting celebrity composer moritz eggert with the job . high-brow culture for the masses based on music by eggert and a libretto by michael klaus , the result premiered at the ruhrtriennale festival of music , literature , theater and dance in north-rhine westphalia last weekend to a rapturous reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the recitative parts peformed by some of germany 's best actors , including joachim krol and peter lohmeyer -lrb- who starred in germany 's box office hit " the miracle of berne " about germany 's legendary world cup win in 1954 -rrb- , and an ensemble starring baritone thomas e. bauer and tenor corby welch , the oratorio was a heady meeting of high-brow and pedestrian culture . while members of the audience sported classic evening wear teamed with borussia dortmund scarves and schalke jerseys , the choir did its best impression of fans in the stalls , waving banners , blowing on whistles and roaring the requisite soccer chants with all the gravitas of a greek chorus . the drama of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggert and klaus have said the piece draws on childhood memories , soccer battle cries , players ' careers , famous managers ' monologues , immortal phrases from players and coaches - such as the hot-headed giovanni trappatoni -lrb- photo -rrb- , known in germany for his impassioned tirades while in charge of bayern - medical diagnoses of injuries on the pitch as well as famous quotations - whether from the stands , the bench , the pitch or from interviews .
it might be a show steeped in allusions to mozart , richard strauß and wagner - who admittedly knew a thing or two about dramatic effect - but many soccer fans would no doubt agree that nothing can beat the real thing . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gods and hooligans clash in soccer opera ancient goddesses selling beer , soccer-mad trojans and greeks fighting in the stands and the struggle between good and evil are all part of an opera aimed at highlighting the problem of racism and violence in stadiums .

the fair , which is scheduled to be officially opened by chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , opened its doors to the press on monday . carmakers are hoping to harness rising demand and wow consumers with a surge of new models . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker and currently in the middle of massive restructuring , plans to launch five to 10 new models by 2010 , said the head of the vw brand , wolfgang bernhard .
despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers . " we 're not expecting a deterioration in end-user prices in 2006 , " panke said , adding that bmw itself was pencilling in full-year sales growth of 9 percent this year . troubled daimlerchrysler also smiling german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler was also optimistic , with the group 's chairman-designate dieter zetsche expressing confidence that the situation at the loss-making smart unit , which has pulled down earnings in the whole mercedes division , could be turned around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , scheduled to take over from jürgen schrempp as daimlerchrysler 's chief executive from january , was put in charge of the troubled mercedes car group , which comprises the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands , with effect from sept .
1 . he was pursuing his duties there " wholeheartedly and with great pleasure " and would stay on for " an unlimited period , " he said . mercedes , previously the cash cow of the daimlerchrysler group , has hit a rough patch and recently embarked on a program of belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting costs by 3 to 4 billion euros by 2007 . all in all , around 1,000 exhibitors from 44 countries were presenting their wares at this year 's iaa , with around 80 new models to be aired for the first time .
appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .
organizers vda said around one million visitors were expected to attend the fair , the same number as at the last iaa two years ago .
industry visitors would be allowed in from thursday and then the general public would be admitted from saturday until sept .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.09.2005 bremen faces barca champions challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen still bears scars from its 7-2 defeat against lyon last season the champions league has left barcelona and werder bremen with painful memories .
but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .
" he is the best player in the world even with -lrb- zinedine -rrb- zidane and ronaldo .
" but it is important we do not underestimate the rest of the team . " french international playmaker ludovic giuly and portuguese ace deco provide laser-like passes for the pacy cameroon striker samuel eto 'o , who operates as a lone target-man .
eto 'o scored both goals in the 2-0 win over mallorca on sunday , but manager frank rijkaard believes his team is not in full flow . " i saw some promising moments but we are still not on top of our game , " said rijkaard . klose in the stands bremen may be anxious about barcelona 's attacking threat , but the spaniards should be wary too after the german team crushed kaiserslautern 5-1 on saturday .
german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .
" the boys will pull it off without me though . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez -lrb- photo -rrb- , normally used as a supersub , is poised to deputize and has had time to prepare .
" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .
last season bremen defeated valencia home and away in the group stage .
but the germans wo n't be able to rest on their laurels since barcelona are a step above their spanish neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .
" all nations agree that isaf and oef need to work more closely together , and that when nato takes over operations throughout the country that there must be unity of command , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .

us defense secretary rumsfeld urged countries not to put restrictions on their forces . a nato spokesman admitted that strains remain among alliance members , notably over plans for closer cooperation between isaf 's peacekeeping mission and the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- , which tackles more frontline combat operations .
" all nations agree that isaf and oef need to work more closely together , and that when nato takes over operations throughout the country that there must be unity of command , " said nato spokesman james appathurai .
but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld " one of the issues we 'll have to wrestle with is the reality that while a number of nato nations been reducing the restrictions that they impose on their forces ... some nations have not yet done that , " he said .
complaints about caveats although he identified no country by name , rumsfeld alluded to an incident last year in kosovo in which german nato troops failed to respond to a serious outbreak of ethnic unrest because of their national rules of engagement .
he complained that so-called national caveats - restrictions that governments place on the use of their forces in nato missions - are so numerous it takes 17 pages to list them all .
nato has beefed up its troop levels in the run-up to afghanistan 's first parliamentary elections in three decades next weekend , which has seen a surge in violence across the country .

new strategy needed at the same time afghan president hamid karzai urged the us and other world leaders to reconsider the strategy for fighting terrorism in the war-torn country , saying there should be a focus on the " sources of terrorism . "
" we and the international community , the coalition , must sit down and reconsider and re-think whether the approach to the threat of terrorism that has -lrb- been -rrb- taken is the absolutely right one , " he told the bbc .
the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.09.2005 bremen faces barca champions challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen still bears scars from its 7-2 defeat against lyon last season the champions league has left barcelona and werder bremen with painful memories .
but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .
" he is the best player in the world even with -lrb- zinedine -rrb- zidane and ronaldo .
" but it is important we do not underestimate the rest of the team . " french international playmaker ludovic giuly and portuguese ace deco provide laser-like passes for the pacy cameroon striker samuel eto 'o , who operates as a lone target-man .
eto 'o scored both goals in the 2-0 win over mallorca on sunday , but manager frank rijkaard believes his team is not in full flow . " i saw some promising moments but we are still not on top of our game , " said rijkaard . klose in the stands bremen may be anxious about barcelona 's attacking threat , but the spaniards should be wary too after the german team crushed kaiserslautern 5-1 on saturday .
german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .
" the boys will pull it off without me though . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez -lrb- photo -rrb- , normally used as a supersub , is poised to deputize and has had time to prepare .
" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .
last season bremen defeated valencia home and away in the group stage .
but the germans wo n't be able to rest on their laurels since barcelona are a step above their spanish neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

" there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls .

he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

the fair , which is scheduled to be officially opened by chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , opened its doors to the press on monday . carmakers are hoping to harness rising demand and wow consumers with a surge of new models . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker and currently in the middle of massive restructuring , plans to launch five to 10 new models by 2010 , said the head of the vw brand , wolfgang bernhard .
despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers . " we 're not expecting a deterioration in end-user prices in 2006 , " panke said , adding that bmw itself was pencilling in full-year sales growth of 9 percent this year . troubled daimlerchrysler also smiling german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler was also optimistic , with the group 's chairman-designate dieter zetsche expressing confidence that the situation at the loss-making smart unit , which has pulled down earnings in the whole mercedes division , could be turned around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , scheduled to take over from jürgen schrempp as daimlerchrysler 's chief executive from january , was put in charge of the troubled mercedes car group , which comprises the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands , with effect from sept .
1 . he was pursuing his duties there " wholeheartedly and with great pleasure " and would stay on for " an unlimited period , " he said . mercedes , previously the cash cow of the daimlerchrysler group , has hit a rough patch and recently embarked on a program of belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting costs by 3 to 4 billion euros by 2007 . all in all , around 1,000 exhibitors from 44 countries were presenting their wares at this year 's iaa , with around 80 new models to be aired for the first time .
appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .
organizers vda said around one million visitors were expected to attend the fair , the same number as at the last iaa two years ago .
industry visitors would be allowed in from thursday and then the general public would be admitted from saturday until sept .

the fair , which is scheduled to be officially opened by chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , opened its doors to the press on monday . carmakers are hoping to harness rising demand and wow consumers with a surge of new models . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker and currently in the middle of massive restructuring , plans to launch five to 10 new models by 2010 , said the head of the vw brand , wolfgang bernhard .
despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers . " we 're not expecting a deterioration in end-user prices in 2006 , " panke said , adding that bmw itself was pencilling in full-year sales growth of 9 percent this year . troubled daimlerchrysler also smiling german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler was also optimistic , with the group 's chairman-designate dieter zetsche expressing confidence that the situation at the loss-making smart unit , which has pulled down earnings in the whole mercedes division , could be turned around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , scheduled to take over from jürgen schrempp as daimlerchrysler 's chief executive from january , was put in charge of the troubled mercedes car group , which comprises the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands , with effect from sept .
1 . he was pursuing his duties there " wholeheartedly and with great pleasure " and would stay on for " an unlimited period , " he said . mercedes , previously the cash cow of the daimlerchrysler group , has hit a rough patch and recently embarked on a program of belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting costs by 3 to 4 billion euros by 2007 . all in all , around 1,000 exhibitors from 44 countries were presenting their wares at this year 's iaa , with around 80 new models to be aired for the first time .
appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .
organizers vda said around one million visitors were expected to attend the fair , the same number as at the last iaa two years ago .
industry visitors would be allowed in from thursday and then the general public would be admitted from saturday until sept .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.09.2005 bremen faces barca champions challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen still bears scars from its 7-2 defeat against lyon last season the champions league has left barcelona and werder bremen with painful memories .
but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .
" he is the best player in the world even with -lrb- zinedine -rrb- zidane and ronaldo .
" but it is important we do not underestimate the rest of the team . " french international playmaker ludovic giuly and portuguese ace deco provide laser-like passes for the pacy cameroon striker samuel eto 'o , who operates as a lone target-man .
eto 'o scored both goals in the 2-0 win over mallorca on sunday , but manager frank rijkaard believes his team is not in full flow . " i saw some promising moments but we are still not on top of our game , " said rijkaard . klose in the stands bremen may be anxious about barcelona 's attacking threat , but the spaniards should be wary too after the german team crushed kaiserslautern 5-1 on saturday .
german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .
" the boys will pull it off without me though . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez -lrb- photo -rrb- , normally used as a supersub , is poised to deputize and has had time to prepare .
" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .
last season bremen defeated valencia home and away in the group stage .
but the germans wo n't be able to rest on their laurels since barcelona are a step above their spanish neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?

featuring choral singing and a storyline but not much else - no staging , no costuming - it 's a musical form geared to weighty subject matter such as the creation of the world or the life of a biblical prophet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as any fan can tell you , soccer is a weighty subject . taking in the full gamut of human emotion - hope , disappointment , euphoria , anguish , you name it - it features protagonists who can be anything from heroic to tragic and a readymade chorus in the form of the spectators . and those elements , more or less , fit the requirements for an oratorio , which is defined as " a musical composition for voices and orchestra that tells a sacred story . " it might not be an obvious medium to extoll the excitement of football culture , but the organizers of fifa 's world cup 2006 official artistic and cultural program nonetheless felt the oratorio was ideally suited to conveying the full furor of a soccer match - and they wasted no time entrusting celebrity composer moritz eggert with the job . high-brow culture for the masses based on music by eggert and a libretto by michael klaus , the result premiered at the ruhrtriennale festival of music , literature , theater and dance in north-rhine westphalia last weekend to a rapturous reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the recitative parts peformed by some of germany 's best actors , including joachim krol and peter lohmeyer -lrb- who starred in germany 's box office hit " the miracle of berne " about germany 's legendary world cup win in 1954 -rrb- , and an ensemble starring baritone thomas e. bauer and tenor corby welch , the oratorio was a heady meeting of high-brow and pedestrian culture . while members of the audience sported classic evening wear teamed with borussia dortmund scarves and schalke jerseys , the choir did its best impression of fans in the stalls , waving banners , blowing on whistles and roaring the requisite soccer chants with all the gravitas of a greek chorus . the drama of soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggert and klaus have said the piece draws on childhood memories , soccer battle cries , players ' careers , famous managers ' monologues , immortal phrases from players and coaches - such as the hot-headed giovanni trappatoni -lrb- photo -rrb- , known in germany for his impassioned tirades while in charge of bayern - medical diagnoses of injuries on the pitch as well as famous quotations - whether from the stands , the bench , the pitch or from interviews .
it might be a show steeped in allusions to mozart , richard strauß and wagner - who admittedly knew a thing or two about dramatic effect - but many soccer fans would no doubt agree that nothing can beat the real thing . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gods and hooligans clash in soccer opera ancient goddesses selling beer , soccer-mad trojans and greeks fighting in the stands and the struggle between good and evil are all part of an opera aimed at highlighting the problem of racism and violence in stadiums .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

the fair , which is scheduled to be officially opened by chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , opened its doors to the press on monday . carmakers are hoping to harness rising demand and wow consumers with a surge of new models . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker and currently in the middle of massive restructuring , plans to launch five to 10 new models by 2010 , said the head of the vw brand , wolfgang bernhard .
despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers . " we 're not expecting a deterioration in end-user prices in 2006 , " panke said , adding that bmw itself was pencilling in full-year sales growth of 9 percent this year . troubled daimlerchrysler also smiling german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler was also optimistic , with the group 's chairman-designate dieter zetsche expressing confidence that the situation at the loss-making smart unit , which has pulled down earnings in the whole mercedes division , could be turned around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , scheduled to take over from jürgen schrempp as daimlerchrysler 's chief executive from january , was put in charge of the troubled mercedes car group , which comprises the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands , with effect from sept .
1 . he was pursuing his duties there " wholeheartedly and with great pleasure " and would stay on for " an unlimited period , " he said . mercedes , previously the cash cow of the daimlerchrysler group , has hit a rough patch and recently embarked on a program of belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting costs by 3 to 4 billion euros by 2007 . all in all , around 1,000 exhibitors from 44 countries were presenting their wares at this year 's iaa , with around 80 new models to be aired for the first time .
appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .
organizers vda said around one million visitors were expected to attend the fair , the same number as at the last iaa two years ago .
industry visitors would be allowed in from thursday and then the general public would be admitted from saturday until sept .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.09.2005 bremen faces barca champions challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen still bears scars from its 7-2 defeat against lyon last season the champions league has left barcelona and werder bremen with painful memories .
but on wednesday the two teams begin their rehabilitation in the group c clash at the weserstadion . last season barcelona were 15 minutes away from the quarter-finals before chelsea captain john terry powered in a header at stamford bridge to send the catalan side crashing out by a 5-4 aggregate scoreline .
barcelona went on to lift the spanish title but the european agony will not be put to bed until they win the trophy and the bid starts against german outfit bremen . bremen also reached the last 16 in the last campaign but crashed out with lyon thrashing thomas schaaf 's side 7-2 in france .
a 10-2 aggregate scoreline represented the heaviest defeat ever recorded in the knockout phase of the competition .
barcelona not in form ? barcelona , like lyon , are a potent attacking unit , with brazilian international star ronaldinho offering a unique creative edge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldinho " it is great to come up against ronaldinho , " said bremen 's brazilian defender naldo .
" he is the best player in the world even with -lrb- zinedine -rrb- zidane and ronaldo .
" but it is important we do not underestimate the rest of the team . " french international playmaker ludovic giuly and portuguese ace deco provide laser-like passes for the pacy cameroon striker samuel eto 'o , who operates as a lone target-man .
eto 'o scored both goals in the 2-0 win over mallorca on sunday , but manager frank rijkaard believes his team is not in full flow . " i saw some promising moments but we are still not on top of our game , " said rijkaard . klose in the stands bremen may be anxious about barcelona 's attacking threat , but the spaniards should be wary too after the german team crushed kaiserslautern 5-1 on saturday .
german international miroslav klose scored twice in that victory , but he will be missing through suspension after getting sent-off in the qualifying match with fc basel . " it is disappointing to watch from the stands but it is my own fault , " said klose .
" the boys will pull it off without me though . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nelson valdez paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez -lrb- photo -rrb- , normally used as a supersub , is poised to deputize and has had time to prepare .
" i have prepared myself as best as possible not having a drop of alcohol since the draw was made , " explained valdez . the hangover from the lyon defeat still remains , but bremen can take heart from their recent record against spanish opposition .
last season bremen defeated valencia home and away in the group stage .
but the germans wo n't be able to rest on their laurels since barcelona are a step above their spanish neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the bundesliga too weak ?
germany 's bundesliga may be one of the biggest soccer leagues in europe , but it 's far from the richest or most competitive .
accordingly , the league is finding it hard to attract the world 's best players .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

the fair , which is scheduled to be officially opened by chancellor gerhard schröder on tuesday , opened its doors to the press on monday . carmakers are hoping to harness rising demand and wow consumers with a surge of new models . volkswagen , europe 's biggest carmaker and currently in the middle of massive restructuring , plans to launch five to 10 new models by 2010 , said the head of the vw brand , wolfgang bernhard .
despite the recent slush scandal and rising petrol prices , vw has managed to win back precious market share . " august this year was the best august we 've had in years , " said chairman bernd pischetsrieder , reaffirming the group 's target to reach unit sales of more than five million vehicles worldwide this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new vw eos convertible vw 's luxury arm , audi , also expects to be able to boost sales by more than one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- this year from 24.5 billion euros in 2004 and worldwide unit sales were expected to reach between 800,000 and 860,000 , said chairman martin winterkorn . audi 's aim is to become the world 's top-selling luxury brand , he said .
" the new models give me confidence that we 're on the right road . " europe-wide rebound in fact , vw 's positive performance is being mirrored by rising sales across the whole of europe . the german auto industry federation vda , which organizes the iaa , calculated that new registrations totalled 838,000 in all of western europe last month , up 8 percent this year .
that brought the total for the first eight months up 0.2 percent to 9.86 million cars throughout europe . german carmakers accounted for a market share of 46.5 percent at the end of august , an increase of one percentage point from the previous year . the german and italian markets grew the fastest , expanding by 12 percent and 13 percent respectively , driven by new models , attractive incentives and rising private demand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut panke , head of carmaker bmw , said that price wars were likely to lose their ferocity , much to the relief of mass model producers . " we 're not expecting a deterioration in end-user prices in 2006 , " panke said , adding that bmw itself was pencilling in full-year sales growth of 9 percent this year . troubled daimlerchrysler also smiling german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler was also optimistic , with the group 's chairman-designate dieter zetsche expressing confidence that the situation at the loss-making smart unit , which has pulled down earnings in the whole mercedes division , could be turned around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche zetsche -lrb- photo -rrb- , scheduled to take over from jürgen schrempp as daimlerchrysler 's chief executive from january , was put in charge of the troubled mercedes car group , which comprises the mercedes-benz , smart and maybach brands , with effect from sept .
1 . he was pursuing his duties there " wholeheartedly and with great pleasure " and would stay on for " an unlimited period , " he said . mercedes , previously the cash cow of the daimlerchrysler group , has hit a rough patch and recently embarked on a program of belt-tightening measures aimed at cutting costs by 3 to 4 billion euros by 2007 . all in all , around 1,000 exhibitors from 44 countries were presenting their wares at this year 's iaa , with around 80 new models to be aired for the first time .
appearing at the iaa for the first time would be three chinese car makers , geely , brilliance and landwind .
organizers vda said around one million visitors were expected to attend the fair , the same number as at the last iaa two years ago .
industry visitors would be allowed in from thursday and then the general public would be admitted from saturday until sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2005 german election enters final phase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some commentators believe the campaign is turning into a circus with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition . with polls showing the conservative opposition 's once commanding lead eroding , the possibility is growing that sunday 's election will produce an awkward marriage of schröder 's social democrats and merkel 's christian democrats . neither party wants such an outcome and , in their last face-to-face meeting before the election , their leaders insisted on monday their respective coalitions would win . " there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .
anyone who has made his election decision should not subject himself to this and switch off the tv . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel in front of an " angie " poster a poll released on monday showed that a coalition of the christian democrats and their preferred partners , the free democrats , would score a combined 48 percent , just short of the 48.5 percent necessary for a governing majority . yet an alliance of the social democrats , the greens and the left party would amass a winning 49 percent , according to the forsa poll for stern magazine and private broadcaster rtl . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election 2005 click here for dw-world 's complete election coverage .

rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .

the nato spokesman noted next weekend 's elections mark a key point in afghanistan , as it draws to the end of a framework set out by world leaders after the oust of the taliban following the september 11 , 2001 terror attacks .

but he said : " within that is where the details need to be worked out , adding : " different countries have different visions . "
rumsfeld , who is discussing plans for expanding the nato-led force in afghanistan over the next year into more volatile southern parts of the country , urged allies on tuesday not to hobble nato commanders in places like afghanistan and kosovo by putting national restrictions on the use of their forces .

" there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls .

" there will not be a grand coalition , " merkel said during the round-table debate on german public broadcaster ard .
" unlike the chancellor , i do n't place great store in opinion polls . " merkel said voters could opt for the country 's economic standstill to continue or " if they want a future , they can choose the option we are offering " - a campaign based on creating jobs , partly funded by a 2 percent rise in national sales tax . bildunterschrift : schröder and merkel during the debate schröder said he was " very optimistic that we will finish in front . "
he added he believed an increasing number of voters were satisfied that the existing coalition of social democrats and greens had shown that " reform is possible without abandoning social cohesion , that a sensitive approach to the ecology is possible in mainstream politics and that germany can do it all it can to solve conflicts peacefully , " a reference to his refusal to send troops to the iraq war . economy and taxes like the head-to-head tv duel between schröder and merkel eight days earlier that had given the social democrats a boost in the polls , the debate of six party leaders was dominated by the economy and tax policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kirchhof schröder rounded on the proposals of merkel 's shadow finance minister paul kirchhof -lrb- photo -rrb- to introduce a flat tax rate of 25 percent . " it is completely unfair that a bus driver will pay as much as a millionaire , " schröder said . merkel hit back that the flat tax proposal was not in the christian democrats ' election manifesto and , in an escalation of the tone between the two leaders , accused schröder of " polemic unworthy of a chancellor . " she said kirchhof would be finance minister " if the voters allowed it . " schröder defended his unpopular economic reform program and said that his government had had to deal with an exceptional set of external factors , including record oil prices , which he partly blamed for unemployment rising to around five million during his seven years in charge . merkel countered that germany 's european neighbors had been faced with the same problems but they had succeeded in creating jobs and economic growth . schröder 's secret list ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " schröder for germany , " reads the campaign poster schröder was also forced to deny that he was concealing a list of hitherto unannounced cuts which media reports say form part of a secret 30-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36.8-billion -rrb- package of savings he will unleash if re-elected . he accused the opposition of dirty tricks , suggesting " finance ministry officials with christian democratic sympathies " had cooked up the list . earlier on monday , the christian democrats had announced a shift in their election strategy in a bid to persuade voters of the danger that the social democrats and greens would be prepared to join forces with germany 's new left party that is made up of the successor party to the former east german communist party and disgruntled social democrats .
but schröder has ruled out a coalition with the new force on the left . turn off the tv ? commentators did n't seem too impressed with the debate , however . " it was the worst election tv program so far , " wrote the berliner zeitung in an editorial on tuesday , adding that the debate still had its positive aspects . " it showed something that 's usually hidden behind strict timing and short questions : clueslessness , " the paper went on .
" this last week of the campaign is about feelings and mood , not politics and arguments .

" a compromise has been found between the british and the french , but the issue is not completely resolved for other member states , including cyprus , " the diplomat said on monday . britain holds the eu 's rotating presidency , while france has been a key country seeking firmer guarantees from ankara on the cyprus issue . turkey is scheduled to begin accession talks on october 3 , but questions have been raised about that date due to divisions among eu states over its continued refusal to recognize the nicosia government . a matter of urgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has been trying to reach consensus among the bloc 's 25 states on how to react to ankara 's declaration on july 29 that a customs accord it signed that day did not mean it endorsed the mediterranean island eu member . the deal between london and paris would involve turkey recognizing all member states as soon as possible , and in any case before joining itself . " we hope to be able to table a text " as early as wednesday 's meeting of eu ambassadors , a british source told afp .
the source declined to discuss its contents , but recalled britain 's position , saying : " turkey we see as important for the eu and we want to see negotiations started on october 3 . " britain is striving for consensus before introducing a text for the ambassadors to examine " so we do n't have to bang heads at the table , " said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity . no reason for " special agreement " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus 's internationally recognized greek cypriot government confirmed it had been briefed by french diplomats about the compromise but had yet to decide whether the concessions went far enough . " we were immediately briefed by the french government on the points france insisted on , " government spokesman kypros chrysostimides told reporters . " whether these points will be enough or not is an issue which will be examined . " chrysostimides said his government 's demand to be recognized by turkey just like the other 24 eu member governments was not a matter that should be thrashed out by britain and france alone . " there is no reason whatsoever for a special agreement , as negotiations remain in the framework of the 25 , " he said , nonetheless adding that there was " nothing to imply " cyprus was being deliberately sidelined . upholding impartiality cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has yet to emerge from its long-standing division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup . on friday , greece warned britain to remain " impartial " and suggested that london was going soft on turkey and its refusal to recognize cyprus . " the success of each eu presidency relies on the principle that impartiality is upheld , " a greek foreign ministry statement said .
" it 's clear that no presidency should exploit its position to advocate politics driven by national interests . " britain , germany and the united states are strong supporters of muslim turkey 's long bid to join the bloc , although the german conservative opposition , which is likely to win elections this weekend , is against it . even if accession talks do go ahead , turkey 's membership is not guaranteed and it would be unlikely to join for at least a decade . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants all or nothing in eu talks tension is rising between the eu and turkey as ankara threatens to abandon its bid to join the european union .

" we are very pleased that he is able to be here in person to receive both the freedom of the city and the british red cross award . "
the freedom of the city of london is thought to have been first bestowed in 1237 and is one of the oldest surviving ceremonies of its kind .

with round , rimless glasses , walrus moustache , baseball cap and leather jacket , mercedes ' new chief executive comes across more like a country & western celebrity than the image of the cautious beancounter which his title suggests .
" all the way from america , " mr zetsche drawls as he climbs out of the truck and slips into an elegant suit , simultaneously switching from american english to german .
the new boss 's less-than-subtle arrival , directly from his job as top dog of poor cousin chrysler , is expected to mark a radical departure from the past .
teutonic cowboy mr zetsche earnt his spurs in detroit , america 's motor city , where - despite having slashed tens of thousands of jobs , closed a number of factories and cut costs by $ 8bn - he is seen as the hero who followed in the footsteps of legendary chrysler chief lee iacocca and rescued the firm all over again .
more than $ 4bn was added to the group 's market value following the news of mr zetsche 's arrival see daimlerchrysler 's share price live earlier this month he took over as mercedes boss and is due to take the helm as daimlerchrysler chief executive in january as well .
he is therefore preparing to do it all again at mercedes , which these days lags well behind arch-rival bmw in terms of sales , profits and image .
the fact that the shiny star is no longer synonymous with quality and reliability has been hard for investors to swallow , though not as hard as the slump in daimlerchrysler 's market value on outgoing chief executive juergen schrempp 's watch .
in july , news of mr schrempp 's departure and mr zetsche 's arrival sent daimlerchrysler 's share price 10 % higher .
but the removal of one weak link does not mean the next will be stronger , and it is unclear how much of the market reaction was due to mr zetsche 's arrival rather than to the news of mr schrempp 's forthcoming departure .
it was probably a combination of the two .
few investors doubt mr zetsche 's capabilities , despite the mammoth task ahead .
new model army showing off his arsenal at the frankfurt motor show , mr zetsche unveiled a string of new , luxurious models that were developed under his predecessor , former mercedes chief eckhard cordes .
" mercedes-benz is the jewel in the crown of -lrb- daimlerchrysler 's -rrb- portfolio , " mr zetsche said - though in truth , both its chrysler subsidiary and its stake in the european aerospace company airbus are worthy contenders at the moment for that crown in terms of margins , sales and reputation .
mr zetsche gave the new s-class his personal touch mr zetsche 's stage performance as he unveiled the latest cars - including the world 's fastest sports utility vehicle , the mercedes ml-63 amg - should go a long way to win over the sceptics .
in showing off the latest executive s-class , which he insists " sets the benchmark for the entire automobile industry " , mr zetsche takes his own company car onto stage , where he introduces it jointly with his wife and the finnish formula one world champion mikka hakkinen of west mclaren mercedes fame .
sceptical reception in the s-class , the extensive range of luxury gadgets is taken for granted , so the sales pitch is more along the lines of safety .
" the mercedes-benz s-class has done more for road safety than any other car , " mr zetsche declares , explaining how this latest model uses a combination of radar and infrared night vision to monitor traffic ahead , electronically linked directly to a computer that gets the brakes ready if it senses an accident ahead .
but although the cars unveiled are impressive , there are also plenty of ways for them to go wrong .
given problems in the past , some are concerned that even amidst the mindboggling over-engineering that has gone into the latest s-class , there might be electronic gremlins that could damage the entire marque 's image and further alienate its customers - many of whom are migrating to competitors such as audi a8 or bmw 's 7-series .
the new mercedes models are sold on safety as well as splendour or take the r-class people carrier represented here with the r-320 cdi , the european version of the grand sports tourer , and the r-63 amg , which mr zetsche describes as " the most powerful space shuttle in the world " .
the r is likely to be popular - despite the verdict of some of those who have driven it .
the influential car magazine describes it as " too big , too expensive and really only a four-seater " , with too small mirrors , a cheap steering wheel and , worst of all , an already obsolete engine .
mr zetsche will be all too aware of such issues and he is clearly ready to bang the drum for the mercedes marque .
within the car world , hopes are high that he will succeed .

the dead were geriatric patients thought to have expired in the heat after hurricane katrina knocked out the hospital 's power supply .
hospital officials have given grim details of the final hours of those who died in memorial medical center , which was abandoned to floodwaters more than a week ago .
despite the desperate efforts of staff and family members to keep them cool , it is thought that many vulnerable patients simply could not cope with the stifling conditions in the damaged medical centre .
one look at the seven-foot -lrb- two metres -rrb- high water mark on the hospital walls is enough to conjure up a vision of the chaos that ensued as hundreds were trapped by rising floods .
hospital staff had begun evacuating patients before hurricane katrina struck the city .
but once the waters came , their job became horrendously difficult .
' no co-ordination ' patients confined to their beds on wards as high as the seventh floor needed to be carried hundreds of yards through the hospital in order to reach an evacuation point .
even then , rescue boats were in short supply .
the care to patients was heroic , but i was disappointed in the system dave goodson hospital administrator as they awaited help , staff and family members tried desperately to ease the suffering of patients wilting in the heat - but to no avail .
while refusing to apportion blame , a hospital administrator told the bbc that he was " disappointed " by a lack of co-ordination in official efforts to evacuate the 317-bed facility .
hospital administrator dave goodson said : " the care to patients was heroic , but i was disappointed in the system . "
national guard troops sent to check the 317-bed hospital had been fully evacuated apparently went to a similarly named centre on the other side of new orleans , said the official .
the main source of help came from family members and staff with boats .
help from the authorities failed to arrive until it was too late , mr goodson said .
heat ' major factor ' " there should have been a more co-ordinated approach to organising the evacuation , " he added .
" i can not get into the clinical diagnosis , but i would say they died because heat was a major factor . "
the hospital was abandoned about a week ago , with the dead still inside .
the bodies had to be left when the hospital was abandoned last week their bodies were only removed on sunday , and the news only announced on monday afternoon , hours after president bush had left the new orleans area .
bob johannesen , a spokesman for the department of health and hospitals , said the louisiana death toll from katrina had risen to 279 , up from 197 at the weekend .
mr goodson said the patients that died had not been abandoned , but had expired despite the best efforts of those around them .
staff at the facility were " relieved " that the bodies had finally been taken away with dignity , he added .
last week more than 30 bodies were recovered from a nursing home in lower st bernard parish - one of the areas hardest hit by katrina and its aftermath .
elderly patients confined to their beds or wheelchairs were reported to have been swiftly overwhelmed by the rising floodwaters .
as the door-to-door operation to recover dead bodies widens around the city , it is sure to reveal more tragic details of the plight of hurricane katrina 's many victims .

the dead were geriatric patients thought to have expired in the heat after hurricane katrina knocked out the hospital 's power supply .
hospital officials have given grim details of the final hours of those who died in memorial medical center , which was abandoned to floodwaters more than a week ago .
despite the desperate efforts of staff and family members to keep them cool , it is thought that many vulnerable patients simply could not cope with the stifling conditions in the damaged medical centre .
one look at the seven-foot -lrb- two metres -rrb- high water mark on the hospital walls is enough to conjure up a vision of the chaos that ensued as hundreds were trapped by rising floods .
hospital staff had begun evacuating patients before hurricane katrina struck the city .
but once the waters came , their job became horrendously difficult .
' no co-ordination ' patients confined to their beds on wards as high as the seventh floor needed to be carried hundreds of yards through the hospital in order to reach an evacuation point .
even then , rescue boats were in short supply . "
the care to patients was heroic , but i was disappointed in the system " dave goodson hospital administrator as they awaited help , staff and family members tried desperately to ease the suffering of patients wilting in the heat - but to no avail .
while refusing to apportion blame , a hospital administrator told the bbc that he was " disappointed " by a lack of co-ordination in official efforts to evacuate the 317-bed facility .
hospital administrator dave goodson said : " the care to patients was heroic , but i was disappointed in the system . "
national guard troops sent to check the 317-bed hospital had been fully evacuated apparently went to a similarly named centre on the other side of new orleans , said the official .
the main source of help came from family members and staff with boats .
help from the authorities failed to arrive until it was too late , mr goodson said .
heat ' major factor ' " there should have been a more co-ordinated approach to organising the evacuation , " he added .
" i can not get into the clinical diagnosis , but i would say they died because heat was a major factor . "
the hospital was abandoned about a week ago , with the dead still inside .
their bodies were only removed on sunday , and the news only announced on monday afternoon , hours after president bush had left the new orleans area .
bob johannesen , a spokesman for the department of health and hospitals , said the louisiana death toll from katrina had risen to 279 , up from 197 at the weekend .
mr goodson said the patients that died had not been abandoned , but had expired despite the best efforts of those around them .
staff at the facility were " relieved " that the bodies had finally been taken away with dignity , he added .
last week more than 30 bodies were recovered from a nursing home in lower st bernard parish - one of the areas hardest hit by katrina and its aftermath .
elderly patients confined to their beds or wheelchairs were reported to have been swiftly overwhelmed by the rising floodwaters .
as the door-to-door operation to recover dead bodies widens around the city , it is sure to reveal more tragic details of the plight of hurricane katrina 's many victims .

hmv launched a 440p-per-share bid for ottakar 's bookstores last week , which valued the firm at £ 96.4m -lrb- $ 177m -rrb- .
the offer trumped an existing bid by the chain 's management of £ 4-a-share , which had initially been backed by ottakar 's independent directors .
ottakar 's was founded in 1987 and today has 137 stores across the uk .
bidding war ottakar 's said it was continuing to hold talks with other parties interested in buying the firm , but that no other offers had yet been made .
the retailer has been the subject of an increasingly frenetic bidding war over the past two weeks . "
the independent directors consider the terms of the offer to be fair and reasonable " ottakar 's statement directors headed by managing director james heneage initially made a 350p-per-share offer to buy the firm around the same time that ottakar 's confirmed it had been approached by hmv .
the management , who are being backed by private equity firm phoenix equity partners , subsequently raised their offer to £ 4-a-share .
ottakar 's independent directors initially recommended the management 's takeover offer but have now withdrawn that recommendation in favour of hmv .
" the independent directors confirm that they consider the terms of the offer to be fair and reasonable and will be unanimously recommending that ottakar 's shareholders accept the offer , " they said in a statement .
hmv already owns the waterstone 's book chain .
if hmv 's bid is successful , the merged bookstore chain would control 23 % of the market , which could raise competition concerns .

the two-day meeting will review plans for nato forces to move into areas in 2006 where us forces now operate .
correspondents say the contentious issue is unlikely to be resolved before sunday 's election in germany .
modernising the defence alliance and fixing a summit date to discuss its expansion will also be on the agenda .
afghan challenge afghans now have a constitution , an elected president , and , after polls this sunday , should have an elected parliament .
but security remains a key concern , with us forces suffering their heaviest losses this year since the 2001 invasion .
nato took over command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in august 2003 .
at present , the 11,000-strong peacekeeping force is concentrated in kabul , with additional units in northern and western areas where security has been less of a problem .
the us would like to see isaf mission expanded to take control of operations in the south and east , where the violence is greatest , by the end of 2006 .
this would allow the us to enact a partial withdrawal of some of its 18,000 soldiers in afghanistan .
" ministers are looking at options which would allow the conduct of two complementary missions to go ahead under single leadership , " john colston , nato 's secretary general for defence policy and planning , said ahead of the meeting , according to ap news agency .
but strong doubts have been expressed in european nations - notably germany , france and turkey - about bringing their troops into frontline combat , and correspondents say there is unlikely to be a final agreement on the plans with tightly contested german parliamentary elections coming on sunday .
ministers will also discuss us proposals to hold nato summits in 2006 and 2008 - the second to look at possible enlargement , reports ap .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer is also set to present ideas on how to continue the modernisation of the 26-member alliance , which has roots in the cold war era , to meet modern requirements for flexible , speedy units .
current nato missions include training iraqi officers in baghdad and airlifting african peacekeepers to sudan .

shafts 15 metres deep are currently being sunk on either side of the river tyne near tyne green in the historic northumerland town .
these will link with the tunnel which will be one metre in diameter , lined with concrete and excavated 10 metres below the river bed .
northumbrian water investment delivery manager , chris watson , said : " the original pipes were laid in a trench dug in the river bed and buried in concrete and had served the area well without a problem for many years .
" we are determined to make the solution even more robust and by running the pipes in a tunnel beneath the river i can confidently say that customers ' supply will be safely carried across the river .
" this was a freak storm and i can say with all honestly that pipes being washed away will never happen again . "

if you want to know what 's going on in belfast , start with the murals .
amid the blast bombs , petrol bombs and barricades of this sudden surge of loyalist violence , fresh graffiti appeared near the albert bridge road .
a mural claiming double standards - namely that the orange order is banned from marching , while the ira can - had been defaced .
a local hand accused the orangemen of cowardice , duplicity and of failing the community .
across the road , more graffiti revealed divisions among loyalist paramilitary groups , street corners marking invisible boundaries of influence .
there 's a growing confidence in the catholic communities - they are streets ahead of a protestant community that sees its identity being eroded sammy douglas , east belfast partnership the world has largely focused on the future of the ira .
but there are real fears of fragmentation in the poorest protestant communities - a fear that support for the peace process will ebb away in areas where it is most needed .
protestant belfast 's problems appear a simple story : high unemployment and communities talking openly of a lack of confidence amid the rise of nationalist self esteem .
the community 's decline is there for all to see - poor neighbourhoods in the shadow of harland and wolff 's historic shipyard cranes , the heavy industries that once employed entire generations .
into this mix goes the strength of paramilitaries , sectarianism , political divisions within unionism and , crucially , a belief among many that london capitulated to the ira .
quick guide northern ireland conflict teenagers near the smouldering remains of barricades smirked that the riots had been " great " - but the police had prevented them taking on a nearby catholic area .
they did n't use the word catholic to describe their neighbours .
one woman in her 50s said she had walked through the riot 's embers with holiday suitcases after her taxi driver refused to drive to her front door , fearing losing his car to teenage hoods .
" what could i do ?
i had to get home , " she said .
" but this is just wicked and i can not understand where this came from and what they are trying to achieve . "
' cauldron overflows ' but david ervine of the progessive unionist party , aligned to the ulster volunteer force , said the warning signs had been there - protestant discontent was a " cauldron that overflowed " .
community at the bottom ?
it 's almost as if we 've gone full circle since 1969 raymond laverty , youth worker raymond laverty was counting the cost of that over-flowing cauldron .
his youth organisation , " the base " , targets teenagers likely to fall into paramilitarism .
this week it 's playing host to a group of teenagers from burnley , scene of race-related riots in 2001 .
they have come to learn about where sectarianism leads - but the first major event was cancelled because of safety fears .
" we 're trying to educate the young that there 's more to life than paramilitaries .
but it 's very difficult when these kids look around and see that the only successful people are those who follow that route .
" we 're having a tug of war every day .
" there is only so much you can do when parents bring their small children out at night to see this violence .
there 's no logic to it . "
raymond says that the chronic lack of opportunities is the breeding ground for resentment which feeds the paramilitaries with willing helpers .
the difference now , he believes , is that the catholic areas are going places in the peace process .
they 've grasped the benefits of the ira ceasefire to rebuild and invest in their own areas .
the opposite is true in many poor protestant areas , he argues , partly because of a lack of local leadership .
" things have been building up since 1998 -lsb- the good friday agreement -rsb- , " he says .
" i think the biggest is this sense that people think the government has let them down while the middle class of unionism has effectively pulled up the ladder behind them and ignored what is happening here .
" it 's almost as if we 've gone full circle since 1969 . "
who 's doing best ?
what he means by this is that some poor protestants are comparing their situation today with that of catholics at the start of the troubles : that they are at the bottom - and some appear to believe the government wants it that way .
history : industry once employed entire communities ask many protestants in poor areas whether they or their catholic neighbours are getting regeneration funding and the answer is " them " .
money is however going into east belfast .
the so-called peace ii initiative has put £ 14m into 72 projects in east belfast , projects like a major community centre , job development schemes and subtle programmes to break down barriers .
today , a mammoth regeneration of what 's now dubbed the " titanic quarter " is underway - a scheme to rebuild opportunities in predominantly protestant areas now that much of the heavy industry has gone .
but sammy douglas of the east belfast partnership says there is a long way to go - not least when the violence damages opportunities aimed directly at protestant communities .
murals and graffiti : divisions within poor protestant areas his organisation is currently overseeing a major commercial development - a digger was stolen from the site during the riots to smash into a bank cash machine .
" the tradition in protestant areas has tended to be of self-reliance , individualism and jobs in heavy industry - jobs that are now gone , " he says .
" in contrast , there has been a stronger tradition among catholic or nationalist families to send their children to university and they are benefiting because of it .
" all of these things have a role to play in the disenfranchisement that many protestant people feel . "
sammy says that protestant people see sinn fein doing an " excellent job " at pushing their community 's agenda - but amid a fragmented unionist response , this only adds to a sense that the peace process has become a " one-way street of concessions " .
" there 's a growing confidence in the catholic communities .
they are streets ahead of a protestant community that sees its identity being eroded .
when people think they are on the losing side , then the community fragments .
" these people -lsb- behind the violence -rsb- have no vision and people without vision perish as they 're only wrecking their own communities .
" we have to pick ourselves up and start all over again . "

it has previously been shown television is linked to weight gain as children are less active and eat while watching .
researchers at new zealand 's university of otago looked at how much tv children aged five to 15 watched .
the international journal of obesity study found the 41 % who were overweight or obese by the age of 26 were those who had watched most tv . "
sensibly limiting hours of tv watching would be a good start " dr ian campbell , national obesity forum a study by the same team published last year suggested children should watch no more than two hours of tv a day to protect their future health .
they warned then that adults who had watched a lot of tv as children were more likely to go on to be overweight , to smoke and to have high cholesterol .
situation ' worse now ' in this latest paper , they monitored tv watching and body mass index - calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres .
a bmi of 25 or over is considered overweight , and one of over 30 obese .
all the 1,000 children studied were born between april 1972 and march 1973 .
at age five , seven , nine and 11 , parents were asked how much tv they watched .
at ages 13 and 15 , the teenagers themselves were questioned .
between the ages of five and 15 , children were found to watch an average of 2.33 hours of tv per weeknight .
aged 13 to 15 , they watched an average of 24.6 per week .
at each age , the amount of tv watched was consistent with the child 's bmi .
the links were stronger in girls , which the researchers say may be linked to the differences in lifestyle and physical make-up of between teenage boys and girls .
' key factor ' writing in the international journal of obesity , the researchers , led by dr robert hancock , said : " although the effect size appears small , the correlation between television viewing and bmi is stronger than reported correlations between bmi and diet or physical activity . "
they add that the situation is likely to have worsened for children since this group were studied - when new zealand had just two television channels , both of which had limited viewing hours .
dr hancock and his team added : " since then , the number of free-to-air tv channels increased from two to four , the time given to advertising increased , pay satellite television become available , viewing hours have increased to provide 24-hour coverage , more homes have video or dvd players and many homes have acquired a computer and internet access .
" thus , despite the apparently heavy television use in this cohort , the opportunities for ' screen-time ' are far higher for children today .
" we believe that watching tv is an important contributing factor to the current epidemic of childhood obesity . "
dr ian campbell , chairman of the national obesity forum , said : " what this study does is highlight the importance of what we do in everyday life , and the way we bring up our children , on future health .
" there is so much that adults can do to help children live healthier lifestyles .
" sensibly limiting hours of tv watching would be a good start . "
he added : " tv watching is not the cause of obesity , but it 's certainly a part of the cause of the problem . "
a spokeswoman for the national heart forum said : " the findings of this study are consistent with those of other similar studies , in that it shows a weak but positive association between tv watching and obesity . "

it has previously been shown television is linked to weight gain as children are less active and eat while watching .
researchers at new zealand 's university of otago looked at how much tv children aged five to 15 watched .
the international journal of obesity study found the 41 % who were overweight or obese by the age of 26 were those who had watched most tv .
sensibly limiting hours of tv watching would be a good start dr ian campbell , national obesity forum a study by the same team published last year suggested children should watch no more than two hours of tv a day to protect their future health .
they warned then that adults who had watched a lot of tv as children were more likely to go on to be overweight , to smoke and to have high cholesterol .
situation ' worse now ' in this latest paper , they monitored tv watching and body mass index - calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in metres .
a bmi of 25 or over is considered overweight , and one of over 30 obese .
all the 1,000 children studied were born between april 1972 and march 1973 .
at age five , seven , nine and 11 , parents were asked how much tv they watched .
at ages 13 and 15 , the teenagers themselves were questioned .
between the ages of five and 15 , children were found to watch an average of 2.33 hours of tv per weeknight .
aged 13 to 15 , they watched an average of 24.6 per week .
at each age , the amount of tv watched was consistent with the child 's bmi .
the links were stronger in girls , which the researchers say may be linked to the differences in lifestyle and physical make-up of between teenage boys and girls .

they add that the situation is likely to have worsened for children since this group were studied - when new zealand had just two television channels , both of which had limited viewing hours .
dr hancock and his team added : " since then , the number of free-to-air tv channels increased from two to four , the time given to advertising increased , pay satellite television become available , viewing hours have increased to provide 24-hour coverage , more homes have video or dvd players and many homes have acquired a computer and internet access .

paltrow was promoting proof , premiered last week at the venice film festival in her absence after transport problems stranded her in the us .
north country , theron 's latest movie , was inspired by america 's first major sexual harassment case .
the festival , which is celebrating its 30th birthday , runs until saturday .
both north country and proof see their stars tackle non-glamorous roles in the kind of issue-based dramas that often find favour with oscar voters .
theron , who won an academy award for playing a serial killer in monster , told reporters that hollywood places too much emphasis on physical beauty .
in north country , directed by new zealander niki caro , who was also behind the film whale rider , she plays a single mother who rallies women workers to rise above the abuse they face at a local mining company .
" when i started telling people about this story , some people looked at me and said , ' you 're doing another ugly movie . '
" all we discussed was the truth of this woman and the life she 's led .
" when you get the answer to the emotional side , the physical elements just come quite organically . "
' parallel path ' proof sees paltrow play a woman mourning the death of her mathematical genius father - a role she first played on the west end stage .

" i think it probably did in a way , " she told reporters .
in north country theron plays a miner who suffers sexual harassment " i do n't transplant my emotions from real life and put them in what i 'm doing , but i was on a very parallel path . "
proof was directed on both stage and film by britain 's john madden , who steered paltrow to an oscar in 1998 's shakespeare in love .
" the performance evolved as you would expect , " he said .
" i think that could n't help but to make it a little more poignant when she came to do the movie because her father had died by that point . "
paltrow was joined on the red carpet by co-stars jake gyllenhaal , hope davis and sir anthony hopkins .
monday 's premiere was also attended by scottish actor alan cumming and red eye actress rachel mcadams .
theron , meanwhile , faced the cameras alongside her fellow north country actors sean bean , sissy spacek and woody harrelson .

his comment comes as he is nominated as the party 's honorary president - the position held by former party leader gwynfor evans until his death in april .
mr wigley said the reasons for standing down as an am in 2003 had not changed .
he said " i am not on the -lrb- party 's -rrb- list of candidates .
i have not put my name forward .
i have no plans to do so . "
mr wigley was speaking as it was announced that he was being put forward for the party 's titular role of honorary president , a nomination widely expected to be approved at the party 's conference this weekend .
the title of honorary president does not bring with it any formal responsibilities , but it will give mr wigley , who was mp for caernarfon for 27 years , added status and influence within plaid cymru .
i ca n't foresee circumstances in which i 'm going to stand dafydd wigley mr wigley has previously said he would be " duty bound " to consider a return to the assembly if the party wished it .
but speaking about the nomination for honorary president , he said he was keen to play his part in securing the party 's success but also played down speculation that he may stand for a seat in the 2007 assembly elections .
wigley fact-file born derby 1 april 1943 educated manchester university ; industrial economist married elinor bennett caernarfon mp 1974-2001 and am 1999-2003 sponsored the disabled persons act of 1981 plaid cymru president 1981-4 and 1991-2000 he told bbc radio wales : " i ca n't foresee circumstances in which i 'm going to stand .
" we do n't even know for certain what will be the boundaries of the constituencies in gwynedd , neither do we know the system for the regional list for the national assembly .
" until those questions are cleared , it 's impossible for the party - not in my context but in anybody 's context - to move forward to make those decisions . "
constituency boundary changes in gwynedd might see the caernarfon constituency he represented as both an mp and an am re-drawn and called arfon .
' honoured ' last week , the party 's deputy assembly leader rhodri glyn thomas called on mr wigley to end speculation about his political ambitions .
mr thomas told bbc wales : " the continuing saga of will he , wo n't he , where 's he going to stand ...
i do n't think that does any good to the party at all . "
gwynfor evans , plaid 's first mp , died in april , aged 92 mr wigley added : " what is important is that the party , instead of arguing about who is doing what in various jobs , pulls together to project to the people of wales an alternative set of policies that can produce better government for wales .
" that is my ambition , not an ambition to be back to where i was two years ago or 20 years ago . "
mr wigley said he would be " honoured " to fill the honorary party post left vacant after the death of gwynfor evans , plaid cymru 's first mp , in april this year at age 92 .
he said : " -lrb- gwynfor evans -rrb- was seen a person who united the party .
" i would hope that i could play some little part in the same sort of process , bringing things together and project plaid cymru forward .
i hope it will provide a base that will allow me to assist the party . "

the latest international education report from the oecd shows the world 's major economies pushing for highly skilled graduate workforces .
the report , up to 2002 , shows the uk with below-average rises in university funding and participation rates .
the government says increases , worth £ 10bn a year , are closing the gap .
in terms of higher education funding , the increase received by uk universities , between 1995 and 2002 , was only about half the average for industrialised countries .
the proportion of young people entering university was 48 % compared to a 53 % average .
overseas students in the lucrative overseas students ' market the uk remains the second most popular destination after the united states , but the " market share " has fallen , as countries such as australia have attracted more asian students .
oecd statistics see how various countries compare on some key figures .
at-a-glance each year the oecd - organisation for economic co-operation and development - produces an overview of the educational spending and achievement of the leading industrialised countries .
and this latest publication shows a pattern of developed countries pumping more money and young people into higher education - with the employment evidence so far showing no signs that having more graduates means a lower premium in earnings for degree-holders .
but in the uk , the oecd figures show that between 1995 and 2002 , a period overlapping between the current and previous governments , there had been an 18 % increase in higher education funding - but this was only about half the oecd average .
the oecd 's head of analysis , andreas schleicher , also said this increase was matched by a similar increase in student numbers - so that there was no real increase in funding per student .
a government spokesperson pointed to large higher education budget increases being introduced - with 6 % annual increases from 2003 until next year , worth up to £ 10bn per year .
in terms of the proportion of youngsters entering university , in the uk much of the debate has focused on whether the government 's target of 50 % is too high .
graduate earnings but the international comparisons show that this uk target , set for the end of the decade , is already below the oecd average , which is now 53 % .
oecd education report 2005 uk best-funded pre-schools south korea 's education success in countries including australia , finland , hungary , iceland , poland , norway , sweden and new zealand , more than 60 % of young people already enter university .
the government says although the uk lags behind in entry numbers , it has a very low drop-out rate among students - and that in terms of the proportion of young people completing degrees , the uk is seventh among oecd member countries .
despite forecasts that graduate earnings would be eroded by an expanding number of people getting degrees , mr schleicher said that in the uk all the evidence pointed towards graduates continuing to gain substantial returns from better-paid jobs .
more so than in almost any other industrialised country , young people in the uk benefit economically from going to university , said mr schleicher .
but he pointed to the downside of this advantage for graduates - that there was a higher penalty paid by those who leave education without degrees .
and mr schleicher pointed to the very poor employment prospects facing those young people in the uk who leave school with few or no qualifications .
