" it is impossible to resist speculation that these are some kind of drainage channels , canyons also maybe a shoreline , " said marty tomasko , a university of arizona specialist who heads the project 's imaging team , showing a picture taken 16 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from the surface . some pictures taken by the tiny robot laboratory appeared to show boulders dotted across a flat landscape , others showed what looked like channels cutting through the moon 's surface .
showing a shot of boulder-like formations taken close-up , tomasko said that the objects " could be ice water blocks " , measuring no more than 15 centimetres -lrb- six inches -rrb- in diameter . bildunterschrift : however he warned that it would take years of analysis before the pictures finally give up their secrets .
" do n't expect any geological explanation at this point , " he said . david southwood , scientific director at the esa , also warned reporters at the esa control centre in darmstadt , germany that the data would take years to decrypt .
" i am blown away by what we saw yesterday , it is extraordinary , " he told reporters .
" but you have to understand the science will be done in the future . " jean-pierre lebreton , directors of the huygens mission at the esa , said the data gathered had fulfilled the project 's most ambitious objectives .
" we already have a clearer picture of titan today , " he said . the probe separated from its us-built mother-ship cassini to land on titan , which scientists hope could provide clues about the origins of our own planet , titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46 billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere . clues to life on earth ? its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on earth billions of years ago .
that process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet . bildunterschrift : this composite was produced from images returned friday , jan .
14 , 2005 , by esa 's huygens probe during its successful descent to land on titan .
it shows a full 360-degree view around huygens .
the left-hand side , behind huygens , shows a boundary between light and dark areas .
the white streaks seen near this boundary could be ground ' fog ' , as they were not immediately visible from higher altitudes .
as the probe descended , it drifted over a plateau -lrb- centre of image -rrb- and was heading towards its landing site in a dark area -lrb- right -rrb- .
from the drift of the probe , the wind speed has been estimated at around 6-7 kilometres per hour .
these images were taken from an altitude of about 8 kilometres and a resolution of about 20 metres per pixel . huygens plunged to the surface of titan earlier friday , carrying half a dozen instruments to assess the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour parachute glide .
it was the farthest landing from earth ever attempted .
cassini , built by nasa , gave the probe a piggyback ride to saturn and its moons .
their epic seven-year trip covered 2.1 billion kilometers -lrb- 1.3 billion miles -rrb- . huygens is named after the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens , who discovered titan in 1655 .
cassini 's name comes from the italian jean-dominique cassini , who discovered the saturn 's satellites iapetus , rhea , tethys and dione .
in 1675 , he discovered what is called the " cassini division , " the gap between saturn 's rings . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa space probe lands safely on titan the european space agency 's huygens probe safely landed on the surface of saturn 's largest moon , titan , on friday , sending back a steady stream of data back to earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?

the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience .

over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience .

the left-hand side , behind huygens , shows a boundary between light and dark areas .
the white streaks seen near this boundary could be ground ' fog ' , as they were not immediately visible from higher altitudes .
as the probe descended , it drifted over a plateau -lrb- centre of image -rrb- and was heading towards its landing site in a dark area -lrb- right -rrb- .
from the drift of the probe , the wind speed has been estimated at around 6-7 kilometres per hour .
these images were taken from an altitude of about 8 kilometres and a resolution of about 20 metres per pixel . huygens plunged to the surface of titan earlier friday , carrying half a dozen instruments to assess the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour parachute glide .
it was the farthest landing from earth ever attempted .
cassini , built by nasa , gave the probe a piggyback ride to saturn and its moons .
their epic seven-year trip covered 2.1 billion kilometers -lrb- 1.3 billion miles -rrb- . huygens is named after the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens , who discovered titan in 1655 .
cassini 's name comes from the italian jean-dominique cassini , who discovered the saturn 's satellites iapetus , rhea , tethys and dione .
in 1675 , he discovered what is called the " cassini division , " the gap between saturn 's rings . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa space probe lands safely on titan the european space agency 's huygens probe safely landed on the surface of saturn 's largest moon , titan , on friday , sending back a steady stream of data back to earth .

it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .

accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience .

the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .

and with psychological problems affecting one in four europeans at some point in their lives , it is not a moment too soon .
it has become europe ’ s " unseen killer , " contributing to 58,000 suicides annually .
in fact , more europeans take their own lives each year than have them claimed in traffic accidents or murders .
" what we see unfortunately in comparison to cardiovascular disease where we have a very positive development in the larger part of europe is an increase in the disease burden of mental illness , " gudjon magnussohn , director of the european ministerial conference on mental health said .
mixed influences magnussohn believes there are a number of factors which feed into the rise , including changing family structures , demanding working environments , the threat of unemployment and insecurity at work and an increase in societal stress .
of the ten countries with the highest rate of suicide in the world , nine are in the european region , and half of those people suffering from depression do not receive treatment .
magnussohn believes taboos are one major reason for that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " social exclusion is far too much of a problem .
it is still a stigma and taboo even though we see progress in many countries which have been dealing with this .
there were some successful campaigns against stigma and discrimination in countries like scotland and greece , where there was clearly a change in public attitudes to mentally ill patients , but we need to be doing much much more , " magnussohn added .

"
politicians and several other organisations have reacted angrily , while the french justice minister has asked prosecutors to investigate . this is by no means the first time jean-marie le pen has sparked controversy over world war ii .
in 1987 he described the nazi gas chambers as a " detail of history , " and he ’ s been convicted of racism and anti-semitism several times . the latest row concerns an interview he gave to a far-right magazine called rivarol about commemorations at the end of the war .
his message : the nazi occupation of france , despite some problems , was not particularly bad for the country . le pen defends comments on thursday morning , le pen appeared on the french radio station rtl to defend his comments after they were reported in the newspaper le monde .
he was unrepentant , especially on the wartime occupation of his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians celebrate the liberation of paris on aug .
25 , 1944 " it ’ s true and it ’ s scandalous that 60 years after the war we can ’ t talk freely about it , " he said .
" proportionately the occupation was far less painful than in other countries and the germans ’ repression was explained by the fact they were engaged in a struggle against the resistance . " in his original interview , the national front leader described the nazi " excesses " as inevitable .
he attacked what he called the " received wisdom " that there had been mass executions across france . legal action condemnation of le pen ’ s comments came thick and fast , and the authorities announced legal action against him . " i ’ ve asked the paris prosecutor to open a preliminary inquiry , " said justice minister dominique perben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor holds up a cardboard with a swastika and the words " no to le pen " during a demonstration before the 2002 presidential run-off election .
like several other politicians , perben added he was outraged at the offense le pen would cause to survivors of the nazi regime , such as those who ’ d been deported to concentration camps . denying the holocaust is a crime in france . licra - the international league against racism and anti-semitism , is also taking legal action over the comments . " you need an organization like our organization so that mr. le pen 's attitude does n't prevail , " said philippe schmidt , licra 's vice president . it ’ s nearly three years since jean-marie le pen reached the final run-off in the french presidential elections .

"
politicians and several other organisations have reacted angrily , while the french justice minister has asked prosecutors to investigate . this is by no means the first time jean-marie le pen has sparked controversy over world war ii .
in 1987 he described the nazi gas chambers as a " detail of history , " and he ’ s been convicted of racism and anti-semitism several times . the latest row concerns an interview he gave to a far-right magazine called rivarol about commemorations at the end of the war .
his message : the nazi occupation of france , despite some problems , was not particularly bad for the country . le pen defends comments on thursday morning , le pen appeared on the french radio station rtl to defend his comments after they were reported in the newspaper le monde .
he was unrepentant , especially on the wartime occupation of his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians celebrate the liberation of paris on aug .
25 , 1944 " it ’ s true and it ’ s scandalous that 60 years after the war we can ’ t talk freely about it , " he said .
" proportionately the occupation was far less painful than in other countries and the germans ’ repression was explained by the fact they were engaged in a struggle against the resistance . " in his original interview , the national front leader described the nazi " excesses " as inevitable .
he attacked what he called the " received wisdom " that there had been mass executions across france . legal action condemnation of le pen ’ s comments came thick and fast , and the authorities announced legal action against him . " i ’ ve asked the paris prosecutor to open a preliminary inquiry , " said justice minister dominique perben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor holds up a cardboard with a swastika and the words " no to le pen " during a demonstration before the 2002 presidential run-off election .
like several other politicians , perben added he was outraged at the offense le pen would cause to survivors of the nazi regime , such as those who ’ d been deported to concentration camps . denying the holocaust is a crime in france . licra - the international league against racism and anti-semitism , is also taking legal action over the comments . " you need an organization like our organization so that mr. le pen 's attitude does n't prevail , " said philippe schmidt , licra 's vice president . it ’ s nearly three years since jean-marie le pen reached the final run-off in the french presidential elections .
since then he ’ s struggled to make his voice heard .
with his latest comments , he has well and truly succeeded in getting himself back in the headlines . alasdair sandford -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

"
politicians and several other organisations have reacted angrily , while the french justice minister has asked prosecutors to investigate . this is by no means the first time jean-marie le pen has sparked controversy over world war ii .
in 1987 he described the nazi gas chambers as a " detail of history , " and he ’ s been convicted of racism and anti-semitism several times . the latest row concerns an interview he gave to a far-right magazine called rivarol about commemorations at the end of the war .
his message : the nazi occupation of france , despite some problems , was not particularly bad for the country . le pen defends comments on thursday morning , le pen appeared on the french radio station rtl to defend his comments after they were reported in the newspaper le monde .
he was unrepentant , especially on the wartime occupation of his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians celebrate the liberation of paris on aug .
25 , 1944 " it ’ s true and it ’ s scandalous that 60 years after the war we can ’ t talk freely about it , " he said .
" proportionately the occupation was far less painful than in other countries and the germans ’ repression was explained by the fact they were engaged in a struggle against the resistance . " in his original interview , the national front leader described the nazi " excesses " as inevitable .
he attacked what he called the " received wisdom " that there had been mass executions across france . legal action condemnation of le pen ’ s comments came thick and fast , and the authorities announced legal action against him . " i ’ ve asked the paris prosecutor to open a preliminary inquiry , " said justice minister dominique perben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor holds up a cardboard with a swastika and the words " no to le pen " during a demonstration before the 2002 presidential run-off election .
like several other politicians , perben added he was outraged at the offense le pen would cause to survivors of the nazi regime , such as those who ’ d been deported to concentration camps . denying the holocaust is a crime in france . licra - the international league against racism and anti-semitism , is also taking legal action over the comments . " you need an organization like our organization so that mr. le pen 's attitude does n't prevail , " said philippe schmidt , licra 's vice president . it ’ s nearly three years since jean-marie le pen reached the final run-off in the french presidential elections .
since then he ’ s struggled to make his voice heard .
with his latest comments , he has well and truly succeeded in getting himself back in the headlines . alasdair sandford -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

" it is impossible to resist speculation that these are some kind of drainage channels , canyons also maybe a shoreline , " said marty tomasko , a university of arizona specialist who heads the project 's imaging team , showing a picture taken 16 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from the surface . some pictures taken by the tiny robot laboratory appeared to show boulders dotted across a flat landscape , others showed what looked like channels cutting through the moon 's surface .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?

the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?

" it is impossible to resist speculation that these are some kind of drainage channels , canyons also maybe a shoreline , " said marty tomasko , a university of arizona specialist who heads the project 's imaging team , showing a picture taken 16 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from the surface . some pictures taken by the tiny robot laboratory appeared to show boulders dotted across a flat landscape , others showed what looked like channels cutting through the moon 's surface .
showing a shot of boulder-like formations taken close-up , tomasko said that the objects " could be ice water blocks " , measuring no more than 15 centimetres -lrb- six inches -rrb- in diameter . bildunterschrift : however he warned that it would take years of analysis before the pictures finally give up their secrets .
" do n't expect any geological explanation at this point , " he said . david southwood , scientific director at the esa , also warned reporters at the esa control centre in darmstadt , germany that the data would take years to decrypt .
" i am blown away by what we saw yesterday , it is extraordinary , " he told reporters .
" but you have to understand the science will be done in the future . " jean-pierre lebreton , directors of the huygens mission at the esa , said the data gathered had fulfilled the project 's most ambitious objectives .
" we already have a clearer picture of titan today , " he said . the probe separated from its us-built mother-ship cassini to land on titan , which scientists hope could provide clues about the origins of our own planet , titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46 billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere . clues to life on earth ? its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on earth billions of years ago .
that process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet . bildunterschrift : this composite was produced from images returned friday , jan .
14 , 2005 , by esa 's huygens probe during its successful descent to land on titan .
it shows a full 360-degree view around huygens .
the left-hand side , behind huygens , shows a boundary between light and dark areas .
the white streaks seen near this boundary could be ground ' fog ' , as they were not immediately visible from higher altitudes .
as the probe descended , it drifted over a plateau -lrb- centre of image -rrb- and was heading towards its landing site in a dark area -lrb- right -rrb- .
from the drift of the probe , the wind speed has been estimated at around 6-7 kilometres per hour .
these images were taken from an altitude of about 8 kilometres and a resolution of about 20 metres per pixel . huygens plunged to the surface of titan earlier friday , carrying half a dozen instruments to assess the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour parachute glide .
it was the farthest landing from earth ever attempted .
cassini , built by nasa , gave the probe a piggyback ride to saturn and its moons .
their epic seven-year trip covered 2.1 billion kilometers -lrb- 1.3 billion miles -rrb- . huygens is named after the dutch astronomer christiaan huygens , who discovered titan in 1655 .
cassini 's name comes from the italian jean-dominique cassini , who discovered the saturn 's satellites iapetus , rhea , tethys and dione .
in 1675 , he discovered what is called the " cassini division , " the gap between saturn 's rings . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa space probe lands safely on titan the european space agency 's huygens probe safely landed on the surface of saturn 's largest moon , titan , on friday , sending back a steady stream of data back to earth .

the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?
the german government is considering dissolving the commission that now oversees the preservation and processing of the stasi files .
the functions of the commission would be handed over to other institutions .

"
politicians and several other organisations have reacted angrily , while the french justice minister has asked prosecutors to investigate . this is by no means the first time jean-marie le pen has sparked controversy over world war ii .
in 1987 he described the nazi gas chambers as a " detail of history , " and he ’ s been convicted of racism and anti-semitism several times . the latest row concerns an interview he gave to a far-right magazine called rivarol about commemorations at the end of the war .

" you need an organization like our organization so that mr. le pen 's attitude does n't prevail , " said philippe schmidt , licra 's vice president . it ’ s nearly three years since jean-marie le pen reached the final run-off in the french presidential elections .

"
politicians and several other organisations have reacted angrily , while the french justice minister has asked prosecutors to investigate . this is by no means the first time jean-marie le pen has sparked controversy over world war ii .
in 1987 he described the nazi gas chambers as a " detail of history , " and he ’ s been convicted of racism and anti-semitism several times . the latest row concerns an interview he gave to a far-right magazine called rivarol about commemorations at the end of the war .
his message : the nazi occupation of france , despite some problems , was not particularly bad for the country . le pen defends comments on thursday morning , le pen appeared on the french radio station rtl to defend his comments after they were reported in the newspaper le monde .
he was unrepentant , especially on the wartime occupation of his country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french civilians celebrate the liberation of paris on aug .
25 , 1944 " it ’ s true and it ’ s scandalous that 60 years after the war we can ’ t talk freely about it , " he said .
" proportionately the occupation was far less painful than in other countries and the germans ’ repression was explained by the fact they were engaged in a struggle against the resistance . " in his original interview , the national front leader described the nazi " excesses " as inevitable .
he attacked what he called the " received wisdom " that there had been mass executions across france . legal action condemnation of le pen ’ s comments came thick and fast , and the authorities announced legal action against him . " i ’ ve asked the paris prosecutor to open a preliminary inquiry , " said justice minister dominique perben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a protestor holds up a cardboard with a swastika and the words " no to le pen " during a demonstration before the 2002 presidential run-off election .
like several other politicians , perben added he was outraged at the offense le pen would cause to survivors of the nazi regime , such as those who ’ d been deported to concentration camps . denying the holocaust is a crime in france . licra - the international league against racism and anti-semitism , is also taking legal action over the comments . " you need an organization like our organization so that mr. le pen 's attitude does n't prevail , " said philippe schmidt , licra 's vice president . it ’ s nearly three years since jean-marie le pen reached the final run-off in the french presidential elections .
since then he ’ s struggled to make his voice heard .
with his latest comments , he has well and truly succeeded in getting himself back in the headlines . alasdair sandford -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.01.2005 the last day of the stasi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi had a massive domestic spy operation fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police . none of the peoples of the former warsaw pact countries were as highly monitored as the east germans : there was one stasi officer for every 180 people , compared with one kgb officer for every 595 people in the soviet union . every aspect of people 's lives , but especially any contact with abroad , was secretly noted and recorded .
the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience . " some people have only just plucked up the courage , " birthler said . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi file agency to be disbanded ?

" it is impossible to resist speculation that these are some kind of drainage channels , canyons also maybe a shoreline , " said marty tomasko , a university of arizona specialist who heads the project 's imaging team , showing a picture taken 16 kilometers -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from the surface . some pictures taken by the tiny robot laboratory appeared to show boulders dotted across a flat landscape , others showed what looked like channels cutting through the moon 's surface .
showing a shot of boulder-like formations taken close-up , tomasko said that the objects " could be ice water blocks " , measuring no more than 15 centimetres -lrb- six inches -rrb- in diameter . bildunterschrift : however he warned that it would take years of analysis before the pictures finally give up their secrets .
" do n't expect any geological explanation at this point , " he said . david southwood , scientific director at the esa , also warned reporters at the esa control centre in darmstadt , germany that the data would take years to decrypt .
" i am blown away by what we saw yesterday , it is extraordinary , " he told reporters .
" but you have to understand the science will be done in the future . " jean-pierre lebreton , directors of the huygens mission at the esa , said the data gathered had fulfilled the project 's most ambitious objectives .
" we already have a clearer picture of titan today , " he said . the probe separated from its us-built mother-ship cassini to land on titan , which scientists hope could provide clues about the origins of our own planet , titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46 billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere . clues to life on earth ? its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on earth billions of years ago .
that process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet . bildunterschrift : this composite was produced from images returned friday , jan .
14 , 2005 , by esa 's huygens probe during its successful descent to land on titan .
it shows a full 360-degree view around huygens .
the left-hand side , behind huygens , shows a boundary between light and dark areas .
the white streaks seen near this boundary could be ground ' fog ' , as they were not immediately visible from higher altitudes .

the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .

the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .

the information could range from political sympathies to the most banal details , with the aim of gathering material to discredit anyone the regime wanted to sideline . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damaged stasi documents in january 1990 , two months after the berlin wall fell , the agents realized the game was up and began destroying their life 's work , shredding and burning files and then desperately tearing them up once the shredding machines broke down .
it was the people 's suspicions that the files were being destroyed which triggered the storming of the headquarters of the state security service , to give the stasi its full name , on january 15 . the invasion of the complex of almost 50 buildings on normannenstrasse in east berlin sent the message to the east german leaders trying in vain to save their crumbling regime that the people would not allow the stasi to be relaunched in another form , with a more ' acceptable ' face . heinz maier was among the first demonstrators to enter the headquarters .
then aged 51 and a project engineer , he was driven to action for two reasons .
" the first was personal .
my son was in a stasi jail for trying to flee the country , " maier recalled this week . " the second was political - this huge security apparatus had to be brought down and , above all else , we did n't want the files to be destroyed , " he said , explaining how on the evening of january 15 , the doors of the building were locked and it appeared closed , but within 15 minutes thousands of people had forced them open and we stormed in . " the lights were on in one of the buildings and i could see the windows were open on an upper floor .
it was clear that files were being destroyed up there , " he said .
the next day , maier joined one of the citizens ' committees set up by the demonstrators to decide the way forward .
" i was one of the first civilians to be allowed in to see the files .
that was when the scale of what the stasi had been doing hit me full in the face . " massive amount of files what he saw were millions and millions of files , each numbered and filed .
if all the files complied by the stasi were laid side by side , they would stretch for 180 kilometers -lrb- 112 miles -rrb- .
the system had never been computerized , so there were also 17 million index cards . on a tour of the buildings this week , journalists were shown a fraction of the files , and one example of the work of the so-called ' m-section ' agents who monitored and often confiscated the mail sent from east berlin .
accompanying a file with the name blanked out for legal reasons , there were careful notes of the letters sent , what they contained , and even photographs of the letters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi archive has thousands of files .
the storming of the stasi headquarters led to the creation in august 1990 of a state-run agency to manage the files , which opened them up to the public to allow people to see what the spies had written about them . but the future of the agency is now threatened .
a leaked government report last year suggested the collection should eventually be broken up and stored in the federal archives in koblenz , in the former west germany . the current head of the stasi data authority , marianne birthler , a former east german pro-democracy activist , says people want the files to be kept open .
over one million people have already seen their file and just under 94,000 people applied last year alone to read theirs , which can often be a daunting experience .

the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham 's nec , with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display .
the pro-shift replaces the motorcycle rider 's left foot motorcycle racer , roy tansley , from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated .
" i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg , " mr tansley told the bbc news website .
" in simple terms , i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device . "
mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing 's governing body , the autocycle union .
" at that time they would n't let any amputee race at all , but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars . "
mr tansley 's invention , the pro-shift , is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing .
in addition to helping disabled riders to compete , mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt .
as a result , there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance .
" i 'm not prejudiced , i 'll sell to able-bodied people if i have to ! " he joked .
rally for all another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car , adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities .
the vehicle belongs to pararallying , the world 's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire .
dave hawkins has never turned anyone away " we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company , " said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company .
" the cars have electronic throttles , electronic brakes , electronic clutches - we 've yet to turn anybody away . "
mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees , quadriplegics , people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated .
pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas .
the car on display is fitted with a ' duck clutch ' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal .
it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar .
uphill challenge when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father , murray , is a former australian formula 3 champion .
joy rainey has won races in her adapted car and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter 's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs .
she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals , a cushion behind her back and raising the seat .
" but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you 'll lose the balance of the car , " she said .
" i bring everything back to me - steering wheel , steering column , gear lever and pedals . "
when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner , trevor , who now does the engineering work .
he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute .
the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level .

she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals , a cushion behind her back and raising the seat .
" but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you 'll lose the balance of the car , " she said .
" i bring everything back to me - steering wheel , steering column , gear lever and pedals . "
when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner , trevor , who now does the engineering work .
he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute .
the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level .
autosport international 2005 is at the nec in birmingham on january 15 and 16 .

the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham 's nec , with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display .
the pro-shift replaces the motorcycle rider 's left foot motorcycle racer , roy tansley , from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated .
" i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg , " mr tansley told the bbc news website .
" in simple terms , i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device . "
mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing 's governing body , the autocycle union .
" at that time they would n't let any amputee race at all , but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars . "
mr tansley 's invention , the pro-shift , is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing .
in addition to helping disabled riders to compete , mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt .
as a result , there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance .
" i 'm not prejudiced , i 'll sell to able-bodied people if i have to ! " he joked .
rally for all another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car , adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities .
the vehicle belongs to pararallying , the world 's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire .
dave hawkins has never turned anyone away " we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company , " said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company .
" the cars have electronic throttles , electronic brakes , electronic clutches - we 've yet to turn anybody away . "
mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees , quadriplegics , people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated .
pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas .
the car on display is fitted with a ' duck clutch ' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal .
it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar .

the motorsport endeavour club left the starting grid yesterday at the autosport international 2005 show at birmingham 's nec , with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display .
the pro-shift replaces the motorcycle rider 's left foot motorcycle racer , roy tansley , from derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated .
" i needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg , " mr tansley told the bbc news website .
" in simple terms , i needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a heath robinson device . "
mr tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing 's governing body , the autocycle union .
" at that time they would n't let any amputee race at all , but eventually they told me i could have a licence as long as i raced sidecars . "
mr tansley 's invention , the pro-shift , is designed to work with hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing .
in addition to helping disabled riders to compete , mr tansley reckons that the pro-shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the isle of man tt .
as a result , there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance .
" i 'm not prejudiced , i 'll sell to able-bodied people if i have to ! " he joked .
rally for all another exhibit on the motorsport endeavour stand is a subaru impreza rally car , adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities .
the vehicle belongs to pararallying , the world 's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in lincolnshire .
dave hawkins has never turned anyone away " we use the latest technology supplied by an italian company , " said rally driver dave hawkins who runs the company .
" the cars have electronic throttles , electronic brakes , electronic clutches - we 've yet to turn anybody away . "
mr hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees , quadriplegics , people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated .
pararallying uses a vauxhall astra gsi with an automatic gearbox and manual subaru imprezas .
the car on display is fitted with a ' duck clutch ' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal .
it also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar .
uphill challenge when joy rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father , murray , is a former australian formula 3 champion .
joy rainey has won races in her adapted car and it was rainey senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter 's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs .
she uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals , a cushion behind her back and raising the seat .
" but in a competition car you have to have everything right or you 'll lose the balance of the car , " she said .
" i bring everything back to me - steering wheel , steering column , gear lever and pedals . "
when she recently took part in the london to sydney marathon she shared the driving with her partner , trevor , who now does the engineering work .
he designed a system for their morris minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute .
the motorsport endeavour club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level .

one stunning black and white image reveals what seem to be drainage channels on a land surface leading out into a dark body of liquid .
another shows a flat surface that is apparently strewn with boulders .
scientists said huygens captured more than 300 images as it dived through the moon 's atmosphere .
speaking about the picture of an apparent shoreline , john zarnecki , principal investigator for the surface science package -lrb- ssp -rrb- on huygens said : " if it 's not a sea , it could be a lake of tar .
and did one see waves ? "
the european space agency has released images captured from altitudes of 16.2km , 8km and one on the surface .
" the pictures just got better after we passed through the haze , " said marty tomasko , who leads the probe 's imaging team .
bbc news : video and audio the first sounds from titan he added that the images would still need to be cleaned up and that scientists would have to study the pictures closely to interpret them .
" we may be seeing a coastline , but that does not necessarily mean it 's liquid now , " mission scientist andrew ball , of the open university told the bbc news website .
" it looks like something has flowed at some time to make those channels .
but is it something that has solidified ? "
see how the huygens probe descended to titan one of two data channels used to record measurements is thought not to have been working on cassini .
as a result , some images taken by huygens may be missing .
the first colour view of titan 's surface from the huygens probe but the other channel had worked well , officials said .
the probe has been sending back data about the moon since it arrived on titan - the furthest from earth a spacecraft has ever landed .
jean-pierre lebreton , mission manager for huygens said the craft had been active for up to seven hours .
he added this was probably down to good design keeping huygens ' instruments warmer than expected despite the temperatures of -179c outside .
" we might even have three floppy disks now , " said professor zarnecki , referring to the previous assumption that the ssp would only collect enough data to fill a floppy disk .
he said the researchers were happy , but that more work was needed before they could say how successful the instrument 's measurements of the surface had been .
huygens ' instruments 1 .
hasi - measures physical and electrical properties of titan 's atmosphere 2 .
gcms - identifies and measures chemical species abundant in moon 's ' air ' 3 .
acp - draws in and analyses atmospheric aerosol particles 4 .
disr - images descent and investigates light levels 5 .
dwe - studies direction and strength of titan 's winds 6 .
ssp - determines physical properties of moon 's surface hopes ride on huygens huygens probe ' looks good ' cassini 's goodbye snap scientists are now piecing together the images , measurements and sounds that are being beamed back to earth from the cassini spacecraft , which had carried huygens for the past seven years .
these should give detailed information on the moon 's weather and chemistry .
the sounds of titan 's stormy atmosphere were recorded with an onboard microphone , and scientists hope they might even hear lightning strikes when they analyse the data .
scientists were relieved when the probe relayed a signal at about 1020 gmt on friday to say it had negotiated titan 's atmosphere .
this told them the first of three parachutes had deployed , pulling off the probe 's rear cover and allowing its antenna to start transmitting .
the european-built probe entered titan 's atmosphere at an altitude of 1,270km -lrb- 789 miles -rrb- at about 1000 gmt .
dominated by nitrogen , methane and other organic -lrb- carbon-based -rrb- molecules , conditions on titan are believed to resemble those on earth 4.6 billion years ago .
as such , it may tell scientists more about the kind of chemical reactions that set the scene for the emergence of life on earth .
the cassini spacecraft arrived at saturn in july 2004 .
it released huygens towards titan on 25 december .
the $ 3.2bn cassini-huygens mission to saturn and its moons is a joint venture between the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the italian space agency -lrb- asi -rrb- .

the idea was proposed by china following talks with taiwanese opposition leaders .

the disasters emergency committee has predicted the uk will raise £ 200m .
debra allcock-tyler , from the directory of social change -lrb- dsc -rrb- , which advises many charities , said some organisations could feel the impact .
and cancer research wales is urging people to remember that their money is still needed for other causes .
ms allcock-tyler , chief executive of the dsc , which gives information and training to the voluntary sector , said charities needed to take measures " to protect their long-term future " .
it is sensible for charities to be thinking about it and be prepared for receiving less cathy pharoah , charities aid foundation " many charities survive day-to-day , and are often not able to think ahead , " she said .
" it would be a real pity if a charity doing important work found itself unable to carry on because of bad planning . "
she urged charities to have contingency plans and consider other sources of income .
cathy pharoah , research director at the charities aid foundation which gives specialist financial services to charities and their supporters , agreed there was " a risk some charities would get less money " .
she drew a comparison with the response to the terrorist attacks in the united states on 11 september , 2001 .
" if you look back at 9/11 , altogether about 1 % of giving went to that appeal that year , " she said .
more than £ 100m has been raised in the uk so far she said that after 9/11 the total amount of money given to charities by people in the uk did not rise .
" it is sensible for charities to be thinking about it and be prepared for receiving less , or working harder to get what they normally do , " she said .
but campbell robb , director of public policy at the national council for voluntary organisations -lrb- ncvo -rrb- , said there was " no evidence to suggest it would have a major effect on other fundraising activities within the charity sector " .
" many donors give on a regular basis to their favourite good causes and are likely to be digging even deeper than usual in order to support the victims of the tsunami , " he said .
" ncvo hopes that the tsunami appeal will in fact encourage people who do not already give to charity regularly to consider doing so . "
minds focused charities said it was too early to predict the impact of tsunami fundraising on them .
but bob fawkes , from cancer research wales , urged people that their money was still needed for other causes .
" i think the general view is charities will be expected to suffer , " he said .
catherine hester , head of oxfam in wales , said she hoped the donations given to tsunami victims would actually help increase its relief efforts throughout the year .
working with nearly 100 other charities , oxfam is taking part in the make poverty history campaign for 2005 .
" the tsunami has focused people 's minds on the issue , " said ms hester .
" we want people to keep that focus , keep that momentum going and look at the wider space . "
welsh-speaking artists have announced they are to hold a fund-raising concert for the tsunami disaster appeal .
performers will include carol parry-jones , geraint griffiths , heather jones , siân james , amanda protheroe-thomas and the cast of the soap pobol y cwm .
the event is being held at the coal exchange in cardiff bay at 1930 gmt on 26 january .
tickets are available from menter caerdydd on 029 2056 565 .
