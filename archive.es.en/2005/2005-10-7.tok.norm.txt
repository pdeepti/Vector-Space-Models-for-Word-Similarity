program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.10.2005 communities court cheap airlines at a cost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called frankfurt-hahn , but not really anywhere near frankfurt discount airlines such as ryanair are basing themselves at small german airports , far from big cities .
to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing . " when you 're in lübeck , you can hear italian being spoken at the next table - we never had that before , " halbedel said .
the new flight routes have been extremely significant for the development of tourism and other industries in the city , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels south airport in charleroi , belgium comparing on a european level , ryanair still has some catching up to do in germany .
the airline flies to 16 destinations in france , 15 in italy , 14 in spain and eight in poland .
in germany though , there are only seven destinations - reason enough for some german mayors to hope the irish company will start flying to their cities , bringing tourist money with them . distorted competitio n despite the fact that every fifth air passenger in germany is now taking off with a cheap airline , a spokesman from the german national carrier lufthansa described the current competition as a " speculative bubble . "
the airlines ' quick growth has in part been enabled by the subsidies paid to the small regional airports . " the subsidies land directly in the pockets of the discount airlines , " lufthansa 's frank püttmann said , adding that this type of distorted competition was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger check-in at frankfurt-hahn airport sometimes the airports contribute to the discount airlines ' marketing costs or overnight costs for the crew , püttmann said .
in dortmund , for example , the airport has even taken on the check-in of passengers .
he argues that regional airports are not suited to playing the role of job motor .
looking at the cost of each new job created , they 're more highly subsidized than even the coal industry in germany . " cheap airlines expect to receive bonuses for their business , something that can become very expensive for the local communities in the long term , " said the head of the board of airlines representatives in germany , martin gaebges . the argument that a regional airport can strengthen purchasing power often does n't pan out . " cheap airlines seldom attract investment-happy business people , " gaebges said . instead , the local population is flown to a distant location where they spend their hard-earned money .
a smarter alternative , he said , to expanding small airports further into the countryside , would be to expand germany 's bigger airports . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cheap airlines reach the sky 's limits once just a pie in the sky dream for the masses , air travel is now an affordably integral part of life .

the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .
word is , the decision will " definitely " be made on sunday .
sound familiar , anyone ? three weeks after the election , the high-stakes poker game that will decide whether the next german chancellor is gerhard schröder or angela merkel drags on , oblivious to the bleary-eyed spectators now begging the players to finally put their cards on the table and call it a night .
the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .

müntefering has given his assurances that the chancellor question will " definitely " be answered on sunday . election complexities only a few more days , then , of front page pieces summing up the latest horse-trading rumors , sorting out the spin coming from various party headquarters , and speculating on what the german public wants , which according to pollsters , is another term for schröder as chancellor , despite a recognition of the conservatives ' claim to power , a claim based on a margin of just four seats . " the situation gives us plenty of work to do , what with all the rumors , speculation , and conflicting views , " said dw-radio 's parliamentary correspondent , uwe hessler . instead of reporting on a new government over the past three weeks , he and countless other journalists found themselves delving into the complexities of the german electoral system . " there 's the issue of overhang seats , then there was the late election in dresden which was a complicated process because of the second ballots , " hessler said , referring to the fact that while the spd as a party won more votes in dresden , the cdu was able to strengthen its position by winning a direct mandate in the late election .
" it goes so much into fine arithmetic , and most of the public is n't interested in that level of detail . " back to business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's editorial writers are ready for the state of limbo to end what the general public wants , say an increasing number of the nation 's editorial writers , is for politicians to get back to the business of politics .

" this most fundamental of political activities was pretty much shelved following the may 22 state elections in north rhine-westfalia . " " there 's no budget for 2006 , and anyone who flips through the tv channels at night ca n't escape the claptrap about all the arguments between the parties , " the südwest presse wrote . " it looks as if neither the cdu nor the spd have quite grasped the fact that it 's their duty to now pull the cart out of the mud together .

the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .
word is , the decision will " definitely " be made on sunday .
sound familiar , anyone ? three weeks after the election , the high-stakes poker game that will decide whether the next german chancellor is gerhard schröder or angela merkel drags on , oblivious to the bleary-eyed spectators now begging the players to finally put their cards on the table and call it a night .
the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .

müntefering has given his assurances that the chancellor question will " definitely " be answered on sunday . election complexities only a few more days , then , of front page pieces summing up the latest horse-trading rumors , sorting out the spin coming from various party headquarters , and speculating on what the german public wants , which according to pollsters , is another term for schröder as chancellor , despite a recognition of the conservatives ' claim to power , a claim based on a margin of just four seats . " the situation gives us plenty of work to do , what with all the rumors , speculation , and conflicting views , " said dw-radio 's parliamentary correspondent , uwe hessler . instead of reporting on a new government over the past three weeks , he and countless other journalists found themselves delving into the complexities of the german electoral system . " there 's the issue of overhang seats , then there was the late election in dresden which was a complicated process because of the second ballots , " hessler said , referring to the fact that while the spd as a party won more votes in dresden , the cdu was able to strengthen its position by winning a direct mandate in the late election .

to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing . " when you 're in lübeck , you can hear italian being spoken at the next table - we never had that before , " halbedel said .
the new flight routes have been extremely significant for the development of tourism and other industries in the city , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels south airport in charleroi , belgium comparing on a european level , ryanair still has some catching up to do in germany .
the airline flies to 16 destinations in france , 15 in italy , 14 in spain and eight in poland .
in germany though , there are only seven destinations - reason enough for some german mayors to hope the irish company will start flying to their cities , bringing tourist money with them . distorted competitio n despite the fact that every fifth air passenger in germany is now taking off with a cheap airline , a spokesman from the german national carrier lufthansa described the current competition as a " speculative bubble .

more than 60 years later , the shots of lost works of art are available online . no one knows who exactly gave the command , but between 1943 and the end of the war , the nazi leadership spent millions of reichsmarks sending photographers to the corners of the german " reich . " from austria to poland and russia , the photographers , on orders from hitler , took tens of thousands of color photos of wall and ceiling murals as well as shots of the buildings themselves .

muralists virtually have no chance to repaint them . " the photos are fairly volatile , " peters said . the institute has been in possession of the slides since 1956 , when the federal interior ministry ordered it to archive the collection .
in 2000 , it reached an agreement with the picture archive in the city of marburg , which held 20,000 slides , to begin digitalizing the collection . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi-hunter simon wiesenthal dies holocaust survivor simon wiesenthal , an untiring campaigner who helped track down hundreds of nazi war criminals , died tuesday in his vienna home , the us-based center founded in his name said .

the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .
word is , the decision will " definitely " be made on sunday .
sound familiar , anyone ? three weeks after the election , the high-stakes poker game that will decide whether the next german chancellor is gerhard schröder or angela merkel drags on , oblivious to the bleary-eyed spectators now begging the players to finally put their cards on the table and call it a night .
the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .
6 , 2005 during talks between christian democrats and social democrats about a left-right coalition in germany giving in fully to the rumor mill that 's been churning in berlin 's corridors of power since the inconclusive general election , german news weekly der spiegel posted a " rumor of the day " column on its web site , giving up-to-the-minute reports on all the speculation surrounding thursday 's equally inconclusive talks . the meeting ended without any announcements to the assembled reporters , and so the waiting game continues , though the end does appear to be in sight .
müntefering has given his assurances that the chancellor question will " definitely " be answered on sunday . election complexities only a few more days , then , of front page pieces summing up the latest horse-trading rumors , sorting out the spin coming from various party headquarters , and speculating on what the german public wants , which according to pollsters , is another term for schröder as chancellor , despite a recognition of the conservatives ' claim to power , a claim based on a margin of just four seats . " the situation gives us plenty of work to do , what with all the rumors , speculation , and conflicting views , " said dw-radio 's parliamentary correspondent , uwe hessler . instead of reporting on a new government over the past three weeks , he and countless other journalists found themselves delving into the complexities of the german electoral system . " there 's the issue of overhang seats , then there was the late election in dresden which was a complicated process because of the second ballots , " hessler said , referring to the fact that while the spd as a party won more votes in dresden , the cdu was able to strengthen its position by winning a direct mandate in the late election .
" it goes so much into fine arithmetic , and most of the public is n't interested in that level of detail . " back to business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's editorial writers are ready for the state of limbo to end what the general public wants , say an increasing number of the nation 's editorial writers , is for politicians to get back to the business of politics . " first and foremost , the citizens have a right to be governed , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
" this most fundamental of political activities was pretty much shelved following the may 22 state elections in north rhine-westfalia . " " there 's no budget for 2006 , and anyone who flips through the tv channels at night ca n't escape the claptrap about all the arguments between the parties , " the südwest presse wrote . " it looks as if neither the cdu nor the spd have quite grasped the fact that it 's their duty to now pull the cart out of the mud together .

brussels is indeed moving to deal with the problem , but there 's still a long way to go . " fortress europe " may have become a cliche . but , for hundreds of african migrants who charged the razor-wire border at spain 's north african enclaves of melilla and ceuta this week and clashed with spanish authorities in their desperate bid to enter europe , the description could not have been more apt . the drastic scenes at the spanish border however are n't the first in europe .
last year it was boatloads of poor african immigrants arriving on the shores of the italian island of lampedusa - many close to death - that served as a kind of " wake-up " call and upped the pressure on brussels to confront the burning issue of illegal immigration in its southern member states . though the current refugee crisis in melilla and ceuta on the spanish border has its roots in a border dispute between spain and morocco and in a narrow territorial sense is a purely ' spanish ' problem , migration experts say there 's no question that the eu has to intervene . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a spanish center " the european union has to seek a common answer to the problem .
ceuta is n't just a spanish problem , but a european one , " said karl kopp , expert on european asylum and migration at the proasyl refugee organization in frankfurt . eu on the path to slow progress kopp says the only way to prevent horrific scenes like the one unraveling on the spanish border is by creating a humanitarian eu-wide common asylum and immigration law - something the eu has repeatedly failed to agree on thanks to entrenched differences between member states who insist on formulating their own national policies . " we definitely need a common asylum policy , safe transit routes and a forward-looking eu-wide immigration law - that 's the basic minimum , " said kopp . at the same time , experts admit that in the face of the repeated tragic attempts by refugees to enter europe , brussels has begun to acknowledge that the problem is n't simply going to go away and has begun changing tack as well as taking tentative steps to address the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers install razor wire on a new section of the fence on the border between spain and morocco " we need a whole bunch of fair and efficient regulations for immigration and asylum procedures .
these have to fight illegal immigration and enable resettlement , " said friso abbing , press spokesman at the eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini 's office at a press conference this week . " and above all , it 's the cooperation with countries of origin and transit nations that 's important in order to steer the migration flood . " resettlement accords under fire the latter in particular has been a focus of eu efforts to fight illegal immigration in recent years within the framework of the so-called " mediterranean partnership . " the main idea is to get the north african nations of morocco , algeria , libya , mauritania and tunisia to take back their illegal immigrants in return for more eu aid to create jobs and infrastructure so that people remained rather than tried to get to europe . bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in the spanish enclave of melilla in the current spanish case , the eu has already sent a team of experts to morocco to examine the country 's border control efforts and offer rabat 40 million euros to beef up border controls following requests by the spanish government . the eu already has such " resettlement agreements " in place with albania , sri lanka and hong kong and is currently negotiating with morocco , turkey , ukraine , algeria and china . but the agreements are n't uncontroversial .
refugee and human rights groups criticize that handing over people to countries with known records of human rights violations is unforgivable and a breach of the geneva convention on torture . " nobody disputes that all african countries - whether it 's libya or morocco - use torture and other completely unacceptable methods and have miserable human rights standards .
so an immigrant is completely defenseless , " said kopp . earlier this year , italy hammered out a " resettlement agreement " with libya and spain is attempting to reactivate a similar accord with morocco . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants sit in front of the police station in spain 's north african enclave of melilla a further eu plan plays on the idea of providing help at the source of the problem and foresees setting up refugee centers , where refugees can find accommodation and counseling . pilot projects are in the pipeline in ukraine , moldavia , belarus and tanzania . long way to go while most agree that the european union has indeed begun to broadly tackle the problem of illegal immigration , some suggest that the popular perception of immigrants needs to be changed for there to be a real impact . " no matter what people tell you in europe , the fact is that most of these illegal immigrants are needed here and they are n't going to overstretch our capacities , " said kopp . dieter oberndörfer , a migration expert at the university of freiburg said it would be naive of the eu to think that it could keep immigrants at arm 's length by increasing funds and development aid to africa . " along with money , even the political conditions in african countries need to improve so that the people may want to remain there , " oberndöfer said . " the problem of illegal immigration is going to keep rising in the future .
the eu should instead start considering how it 's going to distribute the burden of taking on the immigrants among its members .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran has been the thorn in the iaea 's efforts to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions " it has not always been easy for the iaea to secure the reousrces they need from member states , " said ian anthony , of the stockholm international peace research institute .
" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .
" but ... the agency has contributed much to halt the arms race and to prevent -lrb- weapons -rrb- from falling into dangerous hands .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .

" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .

the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .
word is , the decision will " definitely " be made on sunday .
sound familiar , anyone ? three weeks after the election , the high-stakes poker game that will decide whether the next german chancellor is gerhard schröder or angela merkel drags on , oblivious to the bleary-eyed spectators now begging the players to finally put their cards on the table and call it a night .
the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .

müntefering has given his assurances that the chancellor question will " definitely " be answered on sunday . election complexities only a few more days , then , of front page pieces summing up the latest horse-trading rumors , sorting out the spin coming from various party headquarters , and speculating on what the german public wants , which according to pollsters , is another term for schröder as chancellor , despite a recognition of the conservatives ' claim to power , a claim based on a margin of just four seats . " the situation gives us plenty of work to do , what with all the rumors , speculation , and conflicting views , " said dw-radio 's parliamentary correspondent , uwe hessler . instead of reporting on a new government over the past three weeks , he and countless other journalists found themselves delving into the complexities of the german electoral system . " there 's the issue of overhang seats , then there was the late election in dresden which was a complicated process because of the second ballots , " hessler said , referring to the fact that while the spd as a party won more votes in dresden , the cdu was able to strengthen its position by winning a direct mandate in the late election .

" from austria to poland and russia , the photographers , on orders from hitler , took tens of thousands of color photos of wall and ceiling murals as well as shots of the buildings themselves .

muralists virtually have no chance to repaint them . " the photos are fairly volatile , " peters said . the institute has been in possession of the slides since 1956 , when the federal interior ministry ordered it to archive the collection .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran has been the thorn in the iaea 's efforts to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions " it has not always been easy for the iaea to secure the reousrces they need from member states , " said ian anthony , of the stockholm international peace research institute .
" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .
" but ... the agency has contributed much to halt the arms race and to prevent -lrb- weapons -rrb- from falling into dangerous hands .

more than 60 years later , the shots of lost works of art are available online . no one knows who exactly gave the command , but between 1943 and the end of the war , the nazi leadership spent millions of reichsmarks sending photographers to the corners of the german " reich . " from austria to poland and russia , the photographers , on orders from hitler , took tens of thousands of color photos of wall and ceiling murals as well as shots of the buildings themselves .

muralists virtually have no chance to repaint them . " the photos are fairly volatile , " peters said . the institute has been in possession of the slides since 1956 , when the federal interior ministry ordered it to archive the collection .

" some were killed by shots fired by the police and others were killed tramped under their comrades , " the source added , revealing police had arrested 290 people . spanish authorities in melilla said they were not aware of any fatalities following the dawn assault . bildunterschrift : death toll rising a similar assault on the border fencing in the twin spanish north african enclave of ceuta last week saw five immigrants die amid bitter controversy on whether spanish or moroccan police had fired on them . two of the dead who fell on the spanish side of the border bore bullet wounds which spain insisted had come from the moroccan side . the death toll for this summer 's assaults on ceuta and melilla now stands at a combined 14 . moroccan-spanish collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is deporting immigrants back to their home countries the moroccan authorities hailed the collaboration between spanish and moroccan security forces as a success while melilla governor juan jose imbroda said that " moroccan forces collaborated , which is what we expected of them .

under the 1992 deal , morocco agreed to take back immigrants who had illegally entered spain from its territory .
in practice , the agreement has mainly been applied to illegal moroccan immigrants , but rarely to those from other countries . alonso said a first group of 70 were on the point of being taken back to morocco by sea . long-term solution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is urging for an all-european effort to help the countries that immigrants come from spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero meanwhile said madrid was working to resolve the issue .

" some were killed by shots fired by the police and others were killed tramped under their comrades , " the source added , revealing police had arrested 290 people . spanish authorities in melilla said they were not aware of any fatalities following the dawn assault . bildunterschrift : death toll rising a similar assault on the border fencing in the twin spanish north african enclave of ceuta last week saw five immigrants die amid bitter controversy on whether spanish or moroccan police had fired on them . two of the dead who fell on the spanish side of the border bore bullet wounds which spain insisted had come from the moroccan side . the death toll for this summer 's assaults on ceuta and melilla now stands at a combined 14 . moroccan-spanish collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is deporting immigrants back to their home countries the moroccan authorities hailed the collaboration between spanish and moroccan security forces as a success while melilla governor juan jose imbroda said that " moroccan forces collaborated , which is what we expected of them . " a series of assaults in recent weeks had seen several hundred make it into spain despite efforts to drive them back , forcing madrid and rabat to address ways to address the immigration issue . immigrants insist they will do whatever it takes to reach the enclaves , the only european territories on african soil , and have continued to risk their lives even as the size of the fencing has been double from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- . a precedent case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing long-term help will be an ever greater challenge spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso told legislators thursday that the shots which had hit the immigrants who fell on the spanish side of the fencing at ceuta a week ago " do not correspond to spanish civil guard-issue ammunition " as he appeared to pin the blame on moroccan security forces . alonso added the spanish " did not use live ammunition " in trying to repel the immigrants at ceuta on sept .
29 and was " firmly convinced " that those who died had not died at spanish hands . moroccan sources have insisted their troops were not authorized to fire and that they did not so do .
that line of argument , however , disappeared with the announcement of thursday 's fatalities . " moroccan and spanish forces managed to stop them with considerable anti-riot gear , " spain 's cadena ser radio had reported earlier . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat deportations begin thursday 's mass action by immigrants who have spent months waiting their chance in the forest on the moroccan side was the first which saw the authorities on both sides prevent them from entering spain - although spanish police confirmed a report that one malian national had made it across . with several hundred immigrants having succeeded in crossing the double layer barbed wire fencing in previous assaults , madrid said it was seeking rabat 's agreement to reactivate a 1992 accord on control of migration , which would see illegals returned to moroccan soil .
under the 1992 deal , morocco agreed to take back immigrants who had illegally entered spain from its territory .
in practice , the agreement has mainly been applied to illegal moroccan immigrants , but rarely to those from other countries . alonso said a first group of 70 were on the point of being taken back to morocco by sea . long-term solution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is urging for an all-european effort to help the countries that immigrants come from spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero meanwhile said madrid was working to resolve the issue . " we are in the process of finalizing repatriation accords with mali and ghana , " said zapatero , adding to existing accords spain has signed with algeria , guinea-bissau , mauritania , morocco and nigeria . but zapatero admitted that as thousands flee drought and resulting famine in africa " things will remain difficult for years to come if the whole of the european union does not make a special effort to help these countries . " human rights concerns human rights organization amnesty international raised concerns about the possible mistreatment of illegal immigrants by spanish authorities . " it would be a fatal signal , if spain wanted to back out of the geneva convention on protection of refugees , " said ai asylum expert wolfgang grenz . the geneva convention requires the participation of the un refuge agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in examining the reasons for illegal immigration , so that those fleeing from violence and discrimination in their home countries could receive the necessary protection .
most of the north african illegal immigrants to spain , however , are driven by economic rather than political reasons . " but for those who really fled repression and human rights violations in their home countries , extradition could be life-threatening , " grenz said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.10.2005 europe lauds peace prize winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new nobel laureate mohamed elbaradei nobel laureate mohamed elbaradei was " shocked " and the international atomic energy agency he heads in ecstasy after being awarded the nobel peace prize . european leaders praised the decision by the norwegian nobel committee to award elbaradei and the iaea the nobel peace prize for their efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons .
" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran has been the thorn in the iaea 's efforts to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions " it has not always been easy for the iaea to secure the reousrces they need from member states , " said ian anthony , of the stockholm international peace research institute .
" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .
" but ... the agency has contributed much to halt the arms race and to prevent -lrb- weapons -rrb- from falling into dangerous hands .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .

" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .

brussels is indeed moving to deal with the problem , but there 's still a long way to go . " fortress europe " may have become a cliche . but , for hundreds of african migrants who charged the razor-wire border at spain 's north african enclaves of melilla and ceuta this week and clashed with spanish authorities in their desperate bid to enter europe , the description could not have been more apt . the drastic scenes at the spanish border however are n't the first in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.10.2005 europe lauds peace prize winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new nobel laureate mohamed elbaradei nobel laureate mohamed elbaradei was " shocked " and the international atomic energy agency he heads in ecstasy after being awarded the nobel peace prize . european leaders praised the decision by the norwegian nobel committee to award elbaradei and the iaea the nobel peace prize for their efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons .
" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran has been the thorn in the iaea 's efforts to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions " it has not always been easy for the iaea to secure the reousrces they need from member states , " said ian anthony , of the stockholm international peace research institute .
" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .
" but ... the agency has contributed much to halt the arms race and to prevent -lrb- weapons -rrb- from falling into dangerous hands .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .

" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .

" there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .

the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .
word is , the decision will " definitely " be made on sunday .
sound familiar , anyone ? three weeks after the election , the high-stakes poker game that will decide whether the next german chancellor is gerhard schröder or angela merkel drags on , oblivious to the bleary-eyed spectators now begging the players to finally put their cards on the table and call it a night .
the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .
6 , 2005 during talks between christian democrats and social democrats about a left-right coalition in germany giving in fully to the rumor mill that 's been churning in berlin 's corridors of power since the inconclusive general election , german news weekly der spiegel posted a " rumor of the day " column on its web site , giving up-to-the-minute reports on all the speculation surrounding thursday 's equally inconclusive talks . the meeting ended without any announcements to the assembled reporters , and so the waiting game continues , though the end does appear to be in sight .
müntefering has given his assurances that the chancellor question will " definitely " be answered on sunday . election complexities only a few more days , then , of front page pieces summing up the latest horse-trading rumors , sorting out the spin coming from various party headquarters , and speculating on what the german public wants , which according to pollsters , is another term for schröder as chancellor , despite a recognition of the conservatives ' claim to power , a claim based on a margin of just four seats . " the situation gives us plenty of work to do , what with all the rumors , speculation , and conflicting views , " said dw-radio 's parliamentary correspondent , uwe hessler . instead of reporting on a new government over the past three weeks , he and countless other journalists found themselves delving into the complexities of the german electoral system . " there 's the issue of overhang seats , then there was the late election in dresden which was a complicated process because of the second ballots , " hessler said , referring to the fact that while the spd as a party won more votes in dresden , the cdu was able to strengthen its position by winning a direct mandate in the late election .
" it goes so much into fine arithmetic , and most of the public is n't interested in that level of detail . " back to business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's editorial writers are ready for the state of limbo to end what the general public wants , say an increasing number of the nation 's editorial writers , is for politicians to get back to the business of politics . " first and foremost , the citizens have a right to be governed , " wrote the hamburger abendblatt .
" this most fundamental of political activities was pretty much shelved following the may 22 state elections in north rhine-westfalia . " " there 's no budget for 2006 , and anyone who flips through the tv channels at night ca n't escape the claptrap about all the arguments between the parties , " the südwest presse wrote . " it looks as if neither the cdu nor the spd have quite grasped the fact that it 's their duty to now pull the cart out of the mud together . " deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans continue to wait for chancellor germans still waiting for a new - or old - chancellor were left hanging once again when party leaders announced that any deal concerning the leadership of germany would not be completed before the weekend .

to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran has been the thorn in the iaea 's efforts to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions " it has not always been easy for the iaea to secure the reousrces they need from member states , " said ian anthony , of the stockholm international peace research institute .
" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .
" but ... the agency has contributed much to halt the arms race and to prevent -lrb- weapons -rrb- from falling into dangerous hands . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe aligned on iran nuke incentives while the europeans talked tough on wednesday , calling for more transparency from iran in its nuclear activities , the us announced that it may back europe 's incentive-based negotiations with tehran .

hartz 's offices at vw had been searched and potential evidence seized , the prosecutors said .
hartz , who has strenuously denied any wrongdoing , resigned in july as the scandal at the car maker snowballed .
press reports have alleged that hartz , a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder , had effectively issued a " blank check " to vw 's works council in order to " buy " labor representatives ' approval of tough corporate restructuring measures .
the reports claimed that hartz had given clear instructions to make cash available for the business trips for members of the works council , but required no justification for the expenses .
some reports alleged that the money had been used to pay for council members ' pleasure trips to brazil , stays in luxury hotels and even for visits to prostitutes . one of hartz 's co-workers , klaus-joachim gebauer , who was in charge of organizing the trips , is already being investigated by prosecutors for allegations of fraud and abuse of trust . dw-world.de volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound .

" when i am in germany i eat everything german - liverwurst , salami , meat sausage , none of which you can get in britain , " the 35-year-old told glamour magazine in its edition published on thursday .
" for example , the first thing i did in berlin was to go to a snack stand and have a currywurst , " schiffer added , referring to the berlin specialty of a sausage doused in curry-flavored ketchup .
schiffer said that despite her love of sausages , she had had no problem controlling her weight after the birth of her two children with her british film producer husband , matthew vaughn .
" i breastfed for a long time and when i stopped , my weight went down .
since then , i 've been able to eat whatever i want . "
schiffer was one of the world 's most sought-after catwalk models in the 1990s and still regularly appears in advertising campaigns . dw-world.de the triumphant return of the currywurst legal wrangling had banished berlin 's culinary trademark , the currywurst , from the brandenburg gate area .
but the sausage has returned , delighting tastebuds and expanding waistlines in the city center again .

to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing .

he argues that regional airports are not suited to playing the role of job motor .
looking at the cost of each new job created , they 're more highly subsidized than even the coal industry in germany . " cheap airlines expect to receive bonuses for their business , something that can become very expensive for the local communities in the long term , " said the head of the board of airlines representatives in germany , martin gaebges . the argument that a regional airport can strengthen purchasing power often does n't pan out . " cheap airlines seldom attract investment-happy business people , " gaebges said . instead , the local population is flown to a distant location where they spend their hard-earned money .

porsche said in a statement that after already acquiring a stake of 10.26 percent , it had secured a further 8.27-percent stake , meaning that its total shareholding would amount to 18.53 percent once the shares had been handed over .
the deal was expected to be completed " during the month of october " , porsche said .
" we will then be the biggest single shareholder in vw and will aim to have a corresponding representation on vw 's supervisory board , " the car maker said .
in addition , porsche had hedged against a continued rise in vw 's share price by taking out a so-called call option on a further stake of 3.40 percent which it could buy via the open market .
porsche insisted that its final stake in vw would not reach the limit that would compel it to launch a public takeover offer for all of vw shares .
porsche had said last month that it intended to buy around 20 percent of vw 's share capital to help guard it against possible foreign predators .
in the past , the regional state authorities of lower saxony were the biggest shareholder in vw with a stake of 18.2 percent . dw-world.de daimlerchrysler denies plans for vw stake carmaker daimlerchrysler on saturday denied press reports that it was planning to buy into rival volkswagen and make a deal involving possible cross-shareholdings .

porsche said in a statement that after already acquiring a stake of 10.26 percent , it had secured a further 8.27-percent stake , meaning that its total shareholding would amount to 18.53 percent once the shares had been handed over .
the deal was expected to be completed " during the month of october " , porsche said .
" we will then be the biggest single shareholder in vw and will aim to have a corresponding representation on vw 's supervisory board , " the car maker said .
in addition , porsche had hedged against a continued rise in vw 's share price by taking out a so-called call option on a further stake of 3.40 percent which it could buy via the open market .
porsche insisted that its final stake in vw would not reach the limit that would compel it to launch a public takeover offer for all of vw shares .
porsche had said last month that it intended to buy around 20 percent of vw 's share capital to help guard it against possible foreign predators .
in the past , the regional state authorities of lower saxony were the biggest shareholder in vw with a stake of 18.2 percent . dw-world.de daimlerchrysler denies plans for vw stake carmaker daimlerchrysler on saturday denied press reports that it was planning to buy into rival volkswagen and make a deal involving possible cross-shareholdings .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .

iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .

started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.10.2005 spain starts deporting immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities said they were not aware of the latest fatalities spain has started deporting illegal immigrants despite concerns about possible human rights violations while a new assault on the spanish border by african immigrants resulted in six deaths . the six would-be immigrants died , some shot dead by moroccan police , as a mass attempt to storm the fence dividing spain 's north african enclave of melilla from morocco failed thursday , a moroccan interior ministry source told afp . " confronted with the extraordinary violence of the attackers , who were driven by the energy of despair , the police legitimately defended their surveillance posts in front of the barrier and six immigrants died , " the source said , adding another 30 were injured . " some were killed by shots fired by the police and others were killed tramped under their comrades , " the source added , revealing police had arrested 290 people . spanish authorities in melilla said they were not aware of any fatalities following the dawn assault . bildunterschrift : death toll rising a similar assault on the border fencing in the twin spanish north african enclave of ceuta last week saw five immigrants die amid bitter controversy on whether spanish or moroccan police had fired on them . two of the dead who fell on the spanish side of the border bore bullet wounds which spain insisted had come from the moroccan side . the death toll for this summer 's assaults on ceuta and melilla now stands at a combined 14 . moroccan-spanish collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is deporting immigrants back to their home countries the moroccan authorities hailed the collaboration between spanish and moroccan security forces as a success while melilla governor juan jose imbroda said that " moroccan forces collaborated , which is what we expected of them . " a series of assaults in recent weeks had seen several hundred make it into spain despite efforts to drive them back , forcing madrid and rabat to address ways to address the immigration issue . immigrants insist they will do whatever it takes to reach the enclaves , the only european territories on african soil , and have continued to risk their lives even as the size of the fencing has been double from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- . a precedent case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing long-term help will be an ever greater challenge spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso told legislators thursday that the shots which had hit the immigrants who fell on the spanish side of the fencing at ceuta a week ago " do not correspond to spanish civil guard-issue ammunition " as he appeared to pin the blame on moroccan security forces . alonso added the spanish " did not use live ammunition " in trying to repel the immigrants at ceuta on sept .
29 and was " firmly convinced " that those who died had not died at spanish hands . moroccan sources have insisted their troops were not authorized to fire and that they did not so do .
that line of argument , however , disappeared with the announcement of thursday 's fatalities . " moroccan and spanish forces managed to stop them with considerable anti-riot gear , " spain 's cadena ser radio had reported earlier . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat deportations begin thursday 's mass action by immigrants who have spent months waiting their chance in the forest on the moroccan side was the first which saw the authorities on both sides prevent them from entering spain - although spanish police confirmed a report that one malian national had made it across . with several hundred immigrants having succeeded in crossing the double layer barbed wire fencing in previous assaults , madrid said it was seeking rabat 's agreement to reactivate a 1992 accord on control of migration , which would see illegals returned to moroccan soil .
under the 1992 deal , morocco agreed to take back immigrants who had illegally entered spain from its territory .
in practice , the agreement has mainly been applied to illegal moroccan immigrants , but rarely to those from other countries . alonso said a first group of 70 were on the point of being taken back to morocco by sea . long-term solution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is urging for an all-european effort to help the countries that immigrants come from spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero meanwhile said madrid was working to resolve the issue .

" for the german army , afghanistan will have a time limit , but it will be at least ten years , " general hans-christoph ammon told die welt newspaper . with up to 2,200 troops , germany contributes 20 percent of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- which is helping to rebuild the war-ravaged country .
german soldiers are based in the afghan capital kabul and with so-called provincial reconstruction teams in and around the northern cities of kunduz and faizabad .
the german parliament agreed last month to extend the troops ' mandate by another year and said it hoped to raise numbers to 3,000 .
ammon said he hoped the increased troop numbers would give his soldiers more freedom to move around the country and would allow him to reinforce the german presence in faizabad and deploy troops in mazar-i-sharif in the north . dw-world.de cabinet extends aghanistan mission the social democratic-green cabinet has approved an extension of the german military mission in afghanistan by one year .

hartz 's offices at vw had been searched and potential evidence seized , the prosecutors said .
hartz , who has strenuously denied any wrongdoing , resigned in july as the scandal at the car maker snowballed .
press reports have alleged that hartz , a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder , had effectively issued a " blank check " to vw 's works council in order to " buy " labor representatives ' approval of tough corporate restructuring measures .
the reports claimed that hartz had given clear instructions to make cash available for the business trips for members of the works council , but required no justification for the expenses .
some reports alleged that the money had been used to pay for council members ' pleasure trips to brazil , stays in luxury hotels and even for visits to prostitutes . one of hartz 's co-workers , klaus-joachim gebauer , who was in charge of organizing the trips , is already being investigated by prosecutors for allegations of fraud and abuse of trust . dw-world.de volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound .

hartz 's offices at vw had been searched and potential evidence seized , the prosecutors said .
hartz , who has strenuously denied any wrongdoing , resigned in july as the scandal at the car maker snowballed .
press reports have alleged that hartz , a close ally of chancellor gerhard schröder , had effectively issued a " blank check " to vw 's works council in order to " buy " labor representatives ' approval of tough corporate restructuring measures .
the reports claimed that hartz had given clear instructions to make cash available for the business trips for members of the works council , but required no justification for the expenses .
some reports alleged that the money had been used to pay for council members ' pleasure trips to brazil , stays in luxury hotels and even for visits to prostitutes . one of hartz 's co-workers , klaus-joachim gebauer , who was in charge of organizing the trips , is already being investigated by prosecutors for allegations of fraud and abuse of trust . dw-world.de volkswagen scandal deepens the accusations keep piling up in the bribery scandal surrounding german carmaker volkswagen .
the company has reportedly put certain expansion plans on ice while rumors of further resignations abound .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.10.2005 europe gets tough on immigrant crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has to find a way to deal with the thousands who want entry the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .
brussels is indeed moving to deal with the problem , but there 's still a long way to go . " fortress europe " may have become a cliche . but , for hundreds of african migrants who charged the razor-wire border at spain 's north african enclaves of melilla and ceuta this week and clashed with spanish authorities in their desperate bid to enter europe , the description could not have been more apt . the drastic scenes at the spanish border however are n't the first in europe .
last year it was boatloads of poor african immigrants arriving on the shores of the italian island of lampedusa - many close to death - that served as a kind of " wake-up " call and upped the pressure on brussels to confront the burning issue of illegal immigration in its southern member states . though the current refugee crisis in melilla and ceuta on the spanish border has its roots in a border dispute between spain and morocco and in a narrow territorial sense is a purely ' spanish ' problem , migration experts say there 's no question that the eu has to intervene . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a spanish center " the european union has to seek a common answer to the problem .
ceuta is n't just a spanish problem , but a european one , " said karl kopp , expert on european asylum and migration at the proasyl refugee organization in frankfurt . eu on the path to slow progress kopp says the only way to prevent horrific scenes like the one unraveling on the spanish border is by creating a humanitarian eu-wide common asylum and immigration law - something the eu has repeatedly failed to agree on thanks to entrenched differences between member states who insist on formulating their own national policies . " we definitely need a common asylum policy , safe transit routes and a forward-looking eu-wide immigration law - that 's the basic minimum , " said kopp . at the same time , experts admit that in the face of the repeated tragic attempts by refugees to enter europe , brussels has begun to acknowledge that the problem is n't simply going to go away and has begun changing tack as well as taking tentative steps to address the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers install razor wire on a new section of the fence on the border between spain and morocco " we need a whole bunch of fair and efficient regulations for immigration and asylum procedures .
these have to fight illegal immigration and enable resettlement , " said friso abbing , press spokesman at the eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini 's office at a press conference this week . " and above all , it 's the cooperation with countries of origin and transit nations that 's important in order to steer the migration flood . " resettlement accords under fire the latter in particular has been a focus of eu efforts to fight illegal immigration in recent years within the framework of the so-called " mediterranean partnership . " the main idea is to get the north african nations of morocco , algeria , libya , mauritania and tunisia to take back their illegal immigrants in return for more eu aid to create jobs and infrastructure so that people remained rather than tried to get to europe . bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in the spanish enclave of melilla in the current spanish case , the eu has already sent a team of experts to morocco to examine the country 's border control efforts and offer rabat 40 million euros to beef up border controls following requests by the spanish government . the eu already has such " resettlement agreements " in place with albania , sri lanka and hong kong and is currently negotiating with morocco , turkey , ukraine , algeria and china . but the agreements are n't uncontroversial .
refugee and human rights groups criticize that handing over people to countries with known records of human rights violations is unforgivable and a breach of the geneva convention on torture . " nobody disputes that all african countries - whether it 's libya or morocco - use torture and other completely unacceptable methods and have miserable human rights standards .
so an immigrant is completely defenseless , " said kopp . earlier this year , italy hammered out a " resettlement agreement " with libya and spain is attempting to reactivate a similar accord with morocco . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants sit in front of the police station in spain 's north african enclave of melilla a further eu plan plays on the idea of providing help at the source of the problem and foresees setting up refugee centers , where refugees can find accommodation and counseling . pilot projects are in the pipeline in ukraine , moldavia , belarus and tanzania . long way to go while most agree that the european union has indeed begun to broadly tackle the problem of illegal immigration , some suggest that the popular perception of immigrants needs to be changed for there to be a real impact . " no matter what people tell you in europe , the fact is that most of these illegal immigrants are needed here and they are n't going to overstretch our capacities , " said kopp . dieter oberndörfer , a migration expert at the university of freiburg said it would be naive of the eu to think that it could keep immigrants at arm 's length by increasing funds and development aid to africa . " along with money , even the political conditions in african countries need to improve so that the people may want to remain there , " oberndöfer said . " the problem of illegal immigration is going to keep rising in the future .
the eu should instead start considering how it 's going to distribute the burden of taking on the immigrants among its members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.10.2005 communities court cheap airlines at a cost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's called frankfurt-hahn , but not really anywhere near frankfurt discount airlines such as ryanair are basing themselves at small german airports , far from big cities .
to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing . " when you 're in lübeck , you can hear italian being spoken at the next table - we never had that before , " halbedel said .
the new flight routes have been extremely significant for the development of tourism and other industries in the city , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers step off of a ryanair flight at brussels south airport in charleroi , belgium comparing on a european level , ryanair still has some catching up to do in germany .
the airline flies to 16 destinations in france , 15 in italy , 14 in spain and eight in poland .
in germany though , there are only seven destinations - reason enough for some german mayors to hope the irish company will start flying to their cities , bringing tourist money with them . distorted competitio n despite the fact that every fifth air passenger in germany is now taking off with a cheap airline , a spokesman from the german national carrier lufthansa described the current competition as a " speculative bubble . "
the airlines ' quick growth has in part been enabled by the subsidies paid to the small regional airports . " the subsidies land directly in the pockets of the discount airlines , " lufthansa 's frank püttmann said , adding that this type of distorted competition was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger check-in at frankfurt-hahn airport sometimes the airports contribute to the discount airlines ' marketing costs or overnight costs for the crew , püttmann said .
in dortmund , for example , the airport has even taken on the check-in of passengers .
he argues that regional airports are not suited to playing the role of job motor .
looking at the cost of each new job created , they 're more highly subsidized than even the coal industry in germany .

to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing . " when you 're in lübeck , you can hear italian being spoken at the next table - we never had that before , " halbedel said .

the airline flies to 16 destinations in france , 15 in italy , 14 in spain and eight in poland .
in germany though , there are only seven destinations - reason enough for some german mayors to hope the irish company will start flying to their cities , bringing tourist money with them . distorted competitio n despite the fact that every fifth air passenger in germany is now taking off with a cheap airline , a spokesman from the german national carrier lufthansa described the current competition as a " speculative bubble . "
the airlines ' quick growth has in part been enabled by the subsidies paid to the small regional airports . " the subsidies land directly in the pockets of the discount airlines , " lufthansa 's frank püttmann said , adding that this type of distorted competition was unacceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger check-in at frankfurt-hahn airport sometimes the airports contribute to the discount airlines ' marketing costs or overnight costs for the crew , püttmann said .

to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing .

the german media is on chancellor-watch as the nation wearily follows the negotiations to produce the country 's next leader .
word is , the decision will " definitely " be made on sunday .
sound familiar , anyone ? three weeks after the election , the high-stakes poker game that will decide whether the next german chancellor is gerhard schröder or angela merkel drags on , oblivious to the bleary-eyed spectators now begging the players to finally put their cards on the table and call it a night .
the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .
6 , 2005 during talks between christian democrats and social democrats about a left-right coalition in germany giving in fully to the rumor mill that 's been churning in berlin 's corridors of power since the inconclusive general election , german news weekly der spiegel posted a " rumor of the day " column on its web site , giving up-to-the-minute reports on all the speculation surrounding thursday 's equally inconclusive talks . the meeting ended without any announcements to the assembled reporters , and so the waiting game continues , though the end does appear to be in sight .
müntefering has given his assurances that the chancellor question will " definitely " be answered on sunday . election complexities only a few more days , then , of front page pieces summing up the latest horse-trading rumors , sorting out the spin coming from various party headquarters , and speculating on what the german public wants , which according to pollsters , is another term for schröder as chancellor , despite a recognition of the conservatives ' claim to power , a claim based on a margin of just four seats . " the situation gives us plenty of work to do , what with all the rumors , speculation , and conflicting views , " said dw-radio 's parliamentary correspondent , uwe hessler . instead of reporting on a new government over the past three weeks , he and countless other journalists found themselves delving into the complexities of the german electoral system . " there 's the issue of overhang seats , then there was the late election in dresden which was a complicated process because of the second ballots , " hessler said , referring to the fact that while the spd as a party won more votes in dresden , the cdu was able to strengthen its position by winning a direct mandate in the late election .

the german media was all geared up for a decision to be announced on thursday , given that christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel , her bavarian ally edmund stoiber , chancellor gerhard schröder and social democrat chief franz müntefering met behind closed doors for four hours . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : view at the building of the ' parlamentarische gesellschaft ' -lrb- parliament society -rrb- in berlin thursday , oct .

" the job that the iaea does every day is indespensable , " german president horst köhler wrote in a letter to elbaradei .
" to ensure that nuclear energy is only used to peaceful ends ... demands courage and patience ...
you have been a example of this in your years since taking over and have solidified and increased the reputation of the iaea . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder called the award a " very wise decision . "
french president jacques chirac praised the agency 's " key contribution for this vital search for peace , stability and security throughout the world . "
elbaradei himself said he was moved to tears and " completely shocked " by the announcement , made friday morning in oslo .
" the award sends a very strong message : ' keep doing what you are doing - be impartial , act with integrity ' and that is what we intend to do , " he said in a statement .
" the advantage of having this recognition today , it will strengthen my resolve ...
it is also " not a " difficult choice " the iaea had been one of the favorites of the record 199 nominations for the nobel peace prize .
" in the world today , international cooperation in this area is decisive to ensure that we achieve a stable and good world , " nobel committee president old danbolt mjoes told reporters .
" it was not an especially difficult choice this year . "
elbaradei , a trained lawyer from cairo , has been one of the world 's most ferverent campaigners against nuclear proliferation .
since taking charge of the iaea in 1997 , elbaradei has balanced the often differing demands of europe , the united states and arab countries in working towards a peacful solution to iran and north korea 's nuclear plans .
despite some protest out of washington , he was elected this year to a third fourth-year term as iaea director general .
congratulations pour in compliments and congratulations have flowed in from all parts of the world .
most well-wishers say the award comes at an important juncture for the iaea , which recently voted to let the un security council handle iran 's dogged resistance to giving up its nuclear ambitions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran has been the thorn in the iaea 's efforts to halt iran 's nuclear ambitions " it has not always been easy for the iaea to secure the reousrces they need from member states , " said ian anthony , of the stockholm international peace research institute .
" if this is a strong signal which allows them to generate resources to carry out the work they do effectively , then it is a very positive outcome . "
started in 1957 , the vienna agency monitored nuclear proliferation and the arms race during the cold war .
recently , the focus has been less on superpowers than on ensuring nuclear weapons technology does n't get into the wrong hands .
defying washington claims in the months leading up to the march 2003 military invasion of iraq , the agency worked hard to map the location of the country 's weapons of mass destruction .
iaea inspectors strongly contradicted washington 's claims that iraq had such weapons , a view that is widely held today .
over the past year , the un agency and its head have been instrumental in the thorny negotiations in iran and north korea that have brought the dangers of nuclear proliferation to the forefront of international consciousness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal with north korea last month was " a first step " towards the country 's de-nuclearization .
the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors this year found iran guilty of violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , and has threatened to take the country before the un security council .
some reserved in praise " i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations , " elbaradei said earlier this week .
the agency has also helped push forth a six-party north korean nuclear agreement last month , which it described as " a first step toward the goal of the verifiable denuclearization of the korean peninsula in a peaceful manner . " others were more reserved in their praise .
shimon peres , the israel deputy prime minister who was himself a nobel peace laureate told israeli radio that " -lrb- elbaradei -rrb- is a worthy winner , although not the perfect choice . " there are many holes in the apparatus -lrb- to prevent arms proliferation -rrb- such as in the case of iran , " said peres .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.10.2005 spain starts deporting immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities said they were not aware of the latest fatalities spain has started deporting illegal immigrants despite concerns about possible human rights violations while a new assault on the spanish border by african immigrants resulted in six deaths . the six would-be immigrants died , some shot dead by moroccan police , as a mass attempt to storm the fence dividing spain 's north african enclave of melilla from morocco failed thursday , a moroccan interior ministry source told afp . " confronted with the extraordinary violence of the attackers , who were driven by the energy of despair , the police legitimately defended their surveillance posts in front of the barrier and six immigrants died , " the source said , adding another 30 were injured . " some were killed by shots fired by the police and others were killed tramped under their comrades , " the source added , revealing police had arrested 290 people . spanish authorities in melilla said they were not aware of any fatalities following the dawn assault . bildunterschrift : death toll rising a similar assault on the border fencing in the twin spanish north african enclave of ceuta last week saw five immigrants die amid bitter controversy on whether spanish or moroccan police had fired on them . two of the dead who fell on the spanish side of the border bore bullet wounds which spain insisted had come from the moroccan side . the death toll for this summer 's assaults on ceuta and melilla now stands at a combined 14 . moroccan-spanish collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is deporting immigrants back to their home countries the moroccan authorities hailed the collaboration between spanish and moroccan security forces as a success while melilla governor juan jose imbroda said that " moroccan forces collaborated , which is what we expected of them . " a series of assaults in recent weeks had seen several hundred make it into spain despite efforts to drive them back , forcing madrid and rabat to address ways to address the immigration issue . immigrants insist they will do whatever it takes to reach the enclaves , the only european territories on african soil , and have continued to risk their lives even as the size of the fencing has been double from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- . a precedent case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing long-term help will be an ever greater challenge spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso told legislators thursday that the shots which had hit the immigrants who fell on the spanish side of the fencing at ceuta a week ago " do not correspond to spanish civil guard-issue ammunition " as he appeared to pin the blame on moroccan security forces . alonso added the spanish " did not use live ammunition " in trying to repel the immigrants at ceuta on sept .
29 and was " firmly convinced " that those who died had not died at spanish hands . moroccan sources have insisted their troops were not authorized to fire and that they did not so do .
that line of argument , however , disappeared with the announcement of thursday 's fatalities . " moroccan and spanish forces managed to stop them with considerable anti-riot gear , " spain 's cadena ser radio had reported earlier . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat deportations begin thursday 's mass action by immigrants who have spent months waiting their chance in the forest on the moroccan side was the first which saw the authorities on both sides prevent them from entering spain - although spanish police confirmed a report that one malian national had made it across . with several hundred immigrants having succeeded in crossing the double layer barbed wire fencing in previous assaults , madrid said it was seeking rabat 's agreement to reactivate a 1992 accord on control of migration , which would see illegals returned to moroccan soil .
under the 1992 deal , morocco agreed to take back immigrants who had illegally entered spain from its territory .
in practice , the agreement has mainly been applied to illegal moroccan immigrants , but rarely to those from other countries . alonso said a first group of 70 were on the point of being taken back to morocco by sea . long-term solution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is urging for an all-european effort to help the countries that immigrants come from spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero meanwhile said madrid was working to resolve the issue . " we are in the process of finalizing repatriation accords with mali and ghana , " said zapatero , adding to existing accords spain has signed with algeria , guinea-bissau , mauritania , morocco and nigeria . but zapatero admitted that as thousands flee drought and resulting famine in africa " things will remain difficult for years to come if the whole of the european union does not make a special effort to help these countries . " human rights concerns human rights organization amnesty international raised concerns about the possible mistreatment of illegal immigrants by spanish authorities . " it would be a fatal signal , if spain wanted to back out of the geneva convention on protection of refugees , " said ai asylum expert wolfgang grenz . the geneva convention requires the participation of the un refuge agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in examining the reasons for illegal immigration , so that those fleeing from violence and discrimination in their home countries could receive the necessary protection .
most of the north african illegal immigrants to spain , however , are driven by economic rather than political reasons . " but for those who really fled repression and human rights violations in their home countries , extradition could be life-threatening , " grenz said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

" confronted with the extraordinary violence of the attackers , who were driven by the energy of despair , the police legitimately defended their surveillance posts in front of the barrier and six immigrants died , " the source said , adding another 30 were injured . " some were killed by shots fired by the police and others were killed tramped under their comrades , " the source added , revealing police had arrested 290 people . spanish authorities in melilla said they were not aware of any fatalities following the dawn assault . bildunterschrift : death toll rising a similar assault on the border fencing in the twin spanish north african enclave of ceuta last week saw five immigrants die amid bitter controversy on whether spanish or moroccan police had fired on them . two of the dead who fell on the spanish side of the border bore bullet wounds which spain insisted had come from the moroccan side . the death toll for this summer 's assaults on ceuta and melilla now stands at a combined 14 . moroccan-spanish collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain is deporting immigrants back to their home countries the moroccan authorities hailed the collaboration between spanish and moroccan security forces as a success while melilla governor juan jose imbroda said that " moroccan forces collaborated , which is what we expected of them . " a series of assaults in recent weeks had seen several hundred make it into spain despite efforts to drive them back , forcing madrid and rabat to address ways to address the immigration issue . immigrants insist they will do whatever it takes to reach the enclaves , the only european territories on african soil , and have continued to risk their lives even as the size of the fencing has been double from three to six meters -lrb- 10 to 20 feet -rrb- . a precedent case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing long-term help will be an ever greater challenge spanish interior minister jose antonio alonso told legislators thursday that the shots which had hit the immigrants who fell on the spanish side of the fencing at ceuta a week ago " do not correspond to spanish civil guard-issue ammunition " as he appeared to pin the blame on moroccan security forces . alonso added the spanish " did not use live ammunition " in trying to repel the immigrants at ceuta on sept .
29 and was " firmly convinced " that those who died had not died at spanish hands . moroccan sources have insisted their troops were not authorized to fire and that they did not so do .
that line of argument , however , disappeared with the announcement of thursday 's fatalities . " moroccan and spanish forces managed to stop them with considerable anti-riot gear , " spain 's cadena ser radio had reported earlier . bildunterschrift : freies bildformat deportations begin thursday 's mass action by immigrants who have spent months waiting their chance in the forest on the moroccan side was the first which saw the authorities on both sides prevent them from entering spain - although spanish police confirmed a report that one malian national had made it across . with several hundred immigrants having succeeded in crossing the double layer barbed wire fencing in previous assaults , madrid said it was seeking rabat 's agreement to reactivate a 1992 accord on control of migration , which would see illegals returned to moroccan soil .
under the 1992 deal , morocco agreed to take back immigrants who had illegally entered spain from its territory .
in practice , the agreement has mainly been applied to illegal moroccan immigrants , but rarely to those from other countries . alonso said a first group of 70 were on the point of being taken back to morocco by sea . long-term solution needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero is urging for an all-european effort to help the countries that immigrants come from spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero meanwhile said madrid was working to resolve the issue . " we are in the process of finalizing repatriation accords with mali and ghana , " said zapatero , adding to existing accords spain has signed with algeria , guinea-bissau , mauritania , morocco and nigeria . but zapatero admitted that as thousands flee drought and resulting famine in africa " things will remain difficult for years to come if the whole of the european union does not make a special effort to help these countries . " human rights concerns human rights organization amnesty international raised concerns about the possible mistreatment of illegal immigrants by spanish authorities . " it would be a fatal signal , if spain wanted to back out of the geneva convention on protection of refugees , " said ai asylum expert wolfgang grenz . the geneva convention requires the participation of the un refuge agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in examining the reasons for illegal immigration , so that those fleeing from violence and discrimination in their home countries could receive the necessary protection .
most of the north african illegal immigrants to spain , however , are driven by economic rather than political reasons . " but for those who really fled repression and human rights violations in their home countries , extradition could be life-threatening , " grenz said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe gets tough on immigrant crisis the storming of spain 's border by african immigrants this week has turned the spotlight on the eu 's response to a familiar crisis .

last year it was boatloads of poor african immigrants arriving on the shores of the italian island of lampedusa - many close to death - that served as a kind of " wake-up " call and upped the pressure on brussels to confront the burning issue of illegal immigration in its southern member states . though the current refugee crisis in melilla and ceuta on the spanish border has its roots in a border dispute between spain and morocco and in a narrow territorial sense is a purely ' spanish ' problem , migration experts say there 's no question that the eu has to intervene . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a spanish center " the european union has to seek a common answer to the problem .

to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure . business in discount airlines is booming , and germany 's smaller regional airports want to secure their piece of the pie .
millions of euros in public money are typically invested in order to get a route to london or mallorca . to be a player in this fast-growing sector , many communities allow themselves to become dependent on a single airline .
and a chorus of criticism is growing against what 's seen as a waste of taxpayers ' money to expand provincial airports . driving the airport expansions in kassel and lübeck is the prospect of thousands of new jobs .
the state of hesse , together with several communities , plans to invest 151 million euros -lrb- $ 182 million -rrb- in the projects .
so far , the only interested party is ryanair . lübeck has already experienced what it means to be dependent on the airline .
after environmental activists won a court action to temporarily stop the airport 's expansion , ryanair located its new hub not in lübeck , but in nottingham .
it 's not clear yet how the situation will develop - investors who wanted to put millions into lübeck 's loss-making airport were also counting on ryanair 's business . questio n able criteria in the eyes of lübeck 's economic senator , wolfgang halbedel , ryanair 's presence in lübeck since 2000 is still a mainly positive thing .

he argues that regional airports are not suited to playing the role of job motor .
looking at the cost of each new job created , they 're more highly subsidized than even the coal industry in germany . " cheap airlines expect to receive bonuses for their business , something that can become very expensive for the local communities in the long term , " said the head of the board of airlines representatives in germany , martin gaebges . the argument that a regional airport can strengthen purchasing power often does n't pan out .

brussels is indeed moving to deal with the problem , but there 's still a long way to go . " fortress europe " may have become a cliche . but , for hundreds of african migrants who charged the razor-wire border at spain 's north african enclaves of melilla and ceuta this week and clashed with spanish authorities in their desperate bid to enter europe , the description could not have been more apt . the drastic scenes at the spanish border however are n't the first in europe .
last year it was boatloads of poor african immigrants arriving on the shores of the italian island of lampedusa - many close to death - that served as a kind of " wake-up " call and upped the pressure on brussels to confront the burning issue of illegal immigration in its southern member states . though the current refugee crisis in melilla and ceuta on the spanish border has its roots in a border dispute between spain and morocco and in a narrow territorial sense is a purely ' spanish ' problem , migration experts say there 's no question that the eu has to intervene . bildunterschrift : african immigrants in a spanish center " the european union has to seek a common answer to the problem .
ceuta is n't just a spanish problem , but a european one , " said karl kopp , expert on european asylum and migration at the proasyl refugee organization in frankfurt . eu on the path to slow progress kopp says the only way to prevent horrific scenes like the one unraveling on the spanish border is by creating a humanitarian eu-wide common asylum and immigration law - something the eu has repeatedly failed to agree on thanks to entrenched differences between member states who insist on formulating their own national policies . " we definitely need a common asylum policy , safe transit routes and a forward-looking eu-wide immigration law - that 's the basic minimum , " said kopp . at the same time , experts admit that in the face of the repeated tragic attempts by refugees to enter europe , brussels has begun to acknowledge that the problem is n't simply going to go away and has begun changing tack as well as taking tentative steps to address the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers install razor wire on a new section of the fence on the border between spain and morocco " we need a whole bunch of fair and efficient regulations for immigration and asylum procedures .
these have to fight illegal immigration and enable resettlement , " said friso abbing , press spokesman at the eu justice and security commissioner franco frattini 's office at a press conference this week . " and above all , it 's the cooperation with countries of origin and transit nations that 's important in order to steer the migration flood . " resettlement accords under fire the latter in particular has been a focus of eu efforts to fight illegal immigration in recent years within the framework of the so-called " mediterranean partnership . " the main idea is to get the north african nations of morocco , algeria , libya , mauritania and tunisia to take back their illegal immigrants in return for more eu aid to create jobs and infrastructure so that people remained rather than tried to get to europe . bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers leave the rostrogordo area of the border between spain and morocco in the spanish enclave of melilla in the current spanish case , the eu has already sent a team of experts to morocco to examine the country 's border control efforts and offer rabat 40 million euros to beef up border controls following requests by the spanish government . the eu already has such " resettlement agreements " in place with albania , sri lanka and hong kong and is currently negotiating with morocco , turkey , ukraine , algeria and china . but the agreements are n't uncontroversial .
refugee and human rights groups criticize that handing over people to countries with known records of human rights violations is unforgivable and a breach of the geneva convention on torture . " nobody disputes that all african countries - whether it 's libya or morocco - use torture and other completely unacceptable methods and have miserable human rights standards .
so an immigrant is completely defenseless , " said kopp . earlier this year , italy hammered out a " resettlement agreement " with libya and spain is attempting to reactivate a similar accord with morocco . bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants sit in front of the police station in spain 's north african enclave of melilla a further eu plan plays on the idea of providing help at the source of the problem and foresees setting up refugee centers , where refugees can find accommodation and counseling . pilot projects are in the pipeline in ukraine , moldavia , belarus and tanzania . long way to go while most agree that the european union has indeed begun to broadly tackle the problem of illegal immigration , some suggest that the popular perception of immigrants needs to be changed for there to be a real impact . " no matter what people tell you in europe , the fact is that most of these illegal immigrants are needed here and they are n't going to overstretch our capacities , " said kopp . dieter oberndörfer , a migration expert at the university of freiburg said it would be naive of the eu to think that it could keep immigrants at arm 's length by increasing funds and development aid to africa . " along with money , even the political conditions in african countries need to improve so that the people may want to remain there , " oberndöfer said . " the problem of illegal immigration is going to keep rising in the future .
the eu should instead start considering how it 's going to distribute the burden of taking on the immigrants among its members .

gardasil worked against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus -lrb- hpv -rrb- .
some 12,167 women aged 16 to 23 from 13 countries , including the uk , took part in the drug company study .
researchers believe a vaccine could work best if given before adolescence , but critics fear this could encourage under-age sex .
see women 's reactions to the breakthrough merck 's vaccine is in head-to-head competition with a rival from uk-based glaxosmithkline called cervarix .
cervical cancer kills 274,000 women worldwide every year , including 1,120 in the uk .
it is unusual in that most cases are known to be caused by a viral infection .
the two-year future ii trial found gardasil was 100 % effective at preventing early stage cancers and pre-cancerous abnormalities caused by the two key strains of hpv - the 16 and 18 strains - which cause 70 % of cervical cancers .
similar results were previously seen in a smaller trial of 277 women .
these results add to the mounting evidence that cervical cancer vaccines offer great promise for the future dr anne szarewski , cancer research uk dr anne szarewski , clinical consultant at cancer research uk , said : " these results add to the mounting evidence that cervical cancer vaccines offer great promise for the future .
" it appears we may soon be able to prevent the majority of cases .
with any disease caused by a virus , the best way to stop it is to prevent it with a vaccine . "
however , she said a woman should remember that an abnormal smear result does not necessarily mean she will go on to get cervical cancer .
many abnormalities get better on their own and disappear .
also , she said it would take many more years to know whether a vaccine continued to offer long term protection and that it was therefore essential to continue with cervical screening - women attending for regular smear tests .
julietta patnick , director of the nhs cancer screening programmes , said regular cervical screening was the best way of preventing cervical cancer .
all women registered with a gp should receive their first invitation at 25 and then every three years until they are 49 .
women between 50 and 64 will be invited every five years .
licence bids cambridge university 's professor margaret stanley said : " the results of future ii are so exciting because of the sheer size of the trial and the fact that it demonstrated 100 % efficacy . "
professor peter rigby , chief executive of the institute of cancer research , was also excited by the findings .
he said : " nearly 3,000 people in the uk are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year , so it is very exciting to hear it may be possible to drastically reduce this number in the foreseeable future . "
gardasil 's manufacturers - sanofi pasteur and merck & co inc - are expected to apply for a us food and drug administration licence to market the vaccine before the end of the year .
this will be followed by a licence application to the european medicines agency .
although hpv is transmitted through sexual intercourse , a vaccine is likely to be administered to girls as young as 10 to 13 - critics says this could encourage under-age sex .
gardasil also acts against hpv strains six and 11 which cause genital warts .
would you have the jab ?
your comments : to say that cervical cancer is a product of lifestyle is ignorant .
as is stating that the vaccination would encourage under-age sex .

i agree with jackie and hugh , this in a wonderful break through , having endured years of smears and scares despite a " safe sex " lifestyle it would be wonderful to have been vaccinated as a child .
i was vaccinated aged 11 for rubella and that certainly did not encourage me to have a baby underage so why would vaccinating against cervical cancer encourage under-age sex ?
rhyannon boyd , gloucestershire , uk having had cervical cancer at the age of 28 , each smear since brings fear or re-occurrence , so to have this fear removed is fantastic news .
anon , portsmouth as this particular type of cancer runs rampant in my mother 's family , i think this is a marvellous leap forward .
i would be thrilled to have such a vaccine available .
i can not believe that such a jab would encourage under-rage sex any more than would a pap smear .

it is not wildly know that cervical cancer can be the result of contracting a virus from unprotected sex .

gardasil worked against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus -lrb- hpv -rrb- .
some 12,167 women aged 16 to 23 from 13 countries , including the uk , took part in the drug company study .
researchers believe a vaccine could work best if given before adolescence , but critics fear this could encourage under-age sex .
see women 's reactions to the breakthrough merck 's vaccine is in head-to-head competition with a rival from uk-based glaxosmithkline called cervarix .
cervical cancer kills 274,000 women worldwide every year , including 1,120 in the uk .
it is unusual in that most cases are known to be caused by a viral infection .
the two-year future ii trial found gardasil was 100 % effective at preventing early stage cancers and pre-cancerous abnormalities caused by the two key strains of hpv - the 16 and 18 strains - which cause 70 % of cervical cancers .
similar results were previously seen in a smaller trial of 277 women .
these results add to the mounting evidence that cervical cancer vaccines offer great promise for the future dr anne szarewski , cancer research uk dr anne szarewski , clinical consultant at cancer research uk , said : " these results add to the mounting evidence that cervical cancer vaccines offer great promise for the future .
" it appears we may soon be able to prevent the majority of cases .
with any disease caused by a virus , the best way to stop it is to prevent it with a vaccine . "
however , she said a woman should remember that an abnormal smear result does not necessarily mean she will go on to get cervical cancer .
many abnormalities get better on their own and disappear .
also , she said it would take many more years to know whether a vaccine continued to offer long term protection and that it was therefore essential to continue with cervical screening - women attending for regular smear tests .
julietta patnick , director of the nhs cancer screening programmes , said regular cervical screening was the best way of preventing cervical cancer .
all women registered with a gp should receive their first invitation at 25 and then every three years until they are 49 .
women between 50 and 64 will be invited every five years .
licence bids cambridge university 's professor margaret stanley said : " the results of future ii are so exciting because of the sheer size of the trial and the fact that it demonstrated 100 % efficacy . "
professor peter rigby , chief executive of the institute of cancer research , was also excited by the findings .
he said : " nearly 3,000 people in the uk are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year , so it is very exciting to hear it may be possible to drastically reduce this number in the foreseeable future . "
gardasil 's manufacturers - sanofi pasteur and merck & co inc - are expected to apply for a us food and drug administration licence to market the vaccine before the end of the year .
this will be followed by a licence application to the european medicines agency .
although hpv is transmitted through sexual intercourse , a vaccine is likely to be administered to girls as young as 10 to 13 - critics says this could encourage under-age sex .
gardasil also acts against hpv strains six and 11 which cause genital warts .

hugh adler , dublin , ireland as usual it 's mass medication for the majority when a minority get the illness due to their lifestyle .
should n't be giving a vaccine to children when it has only been tested for two years on a small number of people .

gardasil worked against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus -lrb- hpv -rrb- .
some 12,167 women aged 16 to 23 from 13 countries , including the uk , took part in the drug company study .
researchers believe a vaccine could work best if given before adolescence , but critics fear this could encourage under-age sex .
see women 's reactions to the breakthrough merck 's vaccine is in head-to-head competition with a rival from uk-based glaxosmithkline called cervarix .
cervical cancer kills 274,000 women worldwide every year , including 1,120 in the uk .
it is unusual in that most cases are known to be caused by a viral infection .
the two-year future ii trial found gardasil was 100 % effective at preventing early stage cancers and pre-cancerous abnormalities caused by the two key strains of hpv - the 16 and 18 strains - which cause 70 % of cervical cancers .
similar results were previously seen in a smaller trial of 277 women .
these results add to the mounting evidence that cervical cancer vaccines offer great promise for the future dr anne szarewski , cancer research uk dr anne szarewski , clinical consultant at cancer research uk , said : " these results add to the mounting evidence that cervical cancer vaccines offer great promise for the future .
" it appears we may soon be able to prevent the majority of cases .
with any disease caused by a virus , the best way to stop it is to prevent it with a vaccine . "
however , she said a woman should remember that an abnormal smear result does not necessarily mean she will go on to get cervical cancer .
many abnormalities get better on their own and disappear .
also , she said it would take many more years to know whether a vaccine continued to offer long term protection and that it was therefore essential to continue with cervical screening - women attending for regular smear tests .
julietta patnick , director of the nhs cancer screening programmes , said regular cervical screening was the best way of preventing cervical cancer .
all women registered with a gp should receive their first invitation at 25 and then every three years until they are 49 .
women between 50 and 64 will be invited every five years .
licence bids cambridge university 's professor margaret stanley said : " the results of future ii are so exciting because of the sheer size of the trial and the fact that it demonstrated 100 % efficacy . "
professor peter rigby , chief executive of the institute of cancer research , was also excited by the findings .
he said : " nearly 3,000 people in the uk are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year , so it is very exciting to hear it may be possible to drastically reduce this number in the foreseeable future . "
gardasil 's manufacturers - sanofi pasteur and merck & co inc - are expected to apply for a us food and drug administration licence to market the vaccine before the end of the year .
this will be followed by a licence application to the european medicines agency .
although hpv is transmitted through sexual intercourse , a vaccine is likely to be administered to girls as young as 10 to 13 - critics says this could encourage under-age sex .
gardasil also acts against hpv strains six and 11 which cause genital warts .
would you have the jab ?
your comments : to say that cervical cancer is a product of lifestyle is ignorant .
as is stating that the vaccination would encourage under-age sex .
a vaccination against cervical cancer would be welcomed by the majority of women and many men who care about their women .
k montgomery , derby i am not surprised that anon has made the above comments and chosen to hide their identity !
i like the lady from portsmouth had part of my cervix removed five years ago , as i had only had one sexual partner it certainly was n't due to my " lifestyle " .
i would have gladly have had a routine vaccine when i was an adolescent to prevent the pain , anguish and worry i went through plus the six monthly colcoscopy for two years and now the yearly smear tests .
lindy kingsley , canterbury , kent the focus on lifestyle and it being sexually transmitted is misplaced .
i had a cone biopsy in my 20s .
i had been married for five years and my husband was my only partner .
anon , rochester , kent .
i agree with jackie and hugh , this in a wonderful break through , having endured years of smears and scares despite a " safe sex " lifestyle it would be wonderful to have been vaccinated as a child .
i was vaccinated aged 11 for rubella and that certainly did not encourage me to have a baby underage so why would vaccinating against cervical cancer encourage under-age sex ?
rhyannon boyd , gloucestershire , uk having had cervical cancer at the age of 28 , each smear since brings fear or re-occurrence , so to have this fear removed is fantastic news .
anon , portsmouth as this particular type of cancer runs rampant in my mother 's family , i think this is a marvellous leap forward .
i would be thrilled to have such a vaccine available .
i can not believe that such a jab would encourage under-rage sex any more than would a pap smear .
jennifer , dallas , usa i think the jab is a good thing and i do n't think it will make teenagers rush out and have sex any more or less carelessly .
it is not wildly know that cervical cancer can be the result of contracting a virus from unprotected sex .
masses of information is taught about hiv and aids but it would appear that twice as many woman die a year from cervical cancer than people do from aids .
s ensby , london this is fabulous news .
i also heard on the radio that they will be starting tests on older women too .
i had part of my cervix removed about seven years ago and have yearly smears .
i would love to have the jab and be free of the fear of cancer developing .
how ridiculous to suggest it will encourage under-age sex .
does the rubella jab encourage sex through getting rid of the fear of german measles ?
madness .
jackie brown , portsmouth i am 44 years old , does this mean women of my age will not be allowed this vaccine and if not why ?
sharon whittle , bolton well .
i 'm not a woman , so i would n't have the jab .
i just want to say that i think it 's a bit stupid to think that a vaccine aimed at preventing cancer would encourage under-age sex .
even if it will make girls immune to one std , there 's a lot of others out there , and i do n't think anyone would decide to have sex just because they 'd had a single injection .
hugh adler , dublin , ireland as usual it 's mass medication for the majority when a minority get the illness due to their lifestyle .

clinical trials of a new drug , gardasil , have shown it 's highly effective in preventing the main cause of lesions on the cervix , which lead on to cancer .
they 're being hailed as very encouraging by experts on cervical cancer - and doctors are hoping that they 'll be the first of a number of vaccines against various cancers .
this morning , breakfast brought you the latest on what 's being described as a breakthrough .
we heard from professor margaret stanley , of cambridge university , who 's an expert in hpv , the virus which causes around 70 % of cervical cancers .
" this is really remarkable , " prof stanley told us .
" it 's not often you get news like this : it 's a stunning result . "
the hope is that if teenagers are routinely vaccinated , the hpv virus will be wiped out and cervical cancer too will disappear .
prof stanley , who 's not connected at all with the trials of the new drug , gave the vaccination her unequivocal backing : " i would give this to my daughter , without a doubt , " she told us .
we talked to dr eliav barr , head of clinical research at merck .
he emphasised that gardisil is not a cure for those who already have the disease : " this is a prevention vaccine , " he told us .
" it 's used in women who have not been infected .
" those who have still need monitoring with cervical smear tests . "
trials the drugs manufacturer merck and co has been holding clinical trials of gardasil , involving 12,000 women aged 16 to 26 .
the results show that the drug protects women against the human papilloma virus , which is responsible for 70 % of cervical cancers .
they 're hoping it will also prevent several other viruses which cause lesions on the cervix - which may ultimately increase its effectiveness to 87 % .
they 're promising that a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer may be available within as little as a year .
the aim would be to vaccinate girls before they become sexually active , as the hpv virus is largely spread by sexual contact .
in the long run , it could spell the end of cervical smear tests , which many women find undignified and unpleasant .
and , by preventing hpv infections , it could almost eradicate cervical cancer .

clinical trials of a new drug , gardasil , have shown it 's highly effective in preventing the main cause of lesions on the cervix , which lead on to cancer .
they 're being hailed as very encouraging by experts on cervical cancer - and doctors are hoping that they 'll be the first of a number of vaccines against various cancers .
this morning , breakfast brought you the latest on what 's being described as a breakthrough .
we heard from professor margaret stanley , of cambridge university , who 's an expert in hpv , the virus which causes around 70 % of cervical cancers .
" this is really remarkable , " prof stanley told us .
" it 's not often you get news like this : it 's a stunning result . "
the hope is that if teenagers are routinely vaccinated , the hpv virus will be wiped out and cervical cancer too will disappear .
prof stanley , who 's not connected at all with the trials of the new drug , gave the vaccination her unequivocal backing : " i would give this to my daughter , without a doubt , " she told us .
watch our interview in full with prof margaret stanley we talked to dr eliav barr , head of clinical research at merck .
he emphasised that gardisil is not a cure for those who already have the disease : " this is a prevention vaccine , " he told us .
" it 's used in women who have not been infected .
" those who have still need monitoring with cervical smear tests . " watch our interview win full with dr eliav barr trials the drugs manufacturer merck and co has been holding clinical trials of gardasil , involving 12,000 women aged 16 to 26 .
the results show that the drug protects women against the human papilloma virus , which is responsible for 70 % of cervical cancers .
they 're hoping it will also prevent several other viruses which cause lesions on the cervix - which may ultimately increase its effectiveness to 87 % .
they 're promising that a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer may be available within as little as a year .
the aim would be to vaccinate girls before they become sexually active , as the hpv virus is largely spread by sexual contact .
in the long run , it could spell the end of cervical smear tests , which many women find undignified and unpleasant .
and , by preventing hpv infections , it could almost eradicate cervical cancer .

scooterman - which has been running in london for six years - allows motorists to enjoy a drink in the evening without having to worry about driving home .
the company has designed a folding mini-scooter which can fit in a car boot .
the customer is then driven home in their own vehicle .
the cardiff franchise has been set up by it technician kristian hubbard , 29 .
mr hubbard , who has lived in cardiff for nine years , said he got the idea after seeing the company featured on bbc2 's top gear in june .
he told the bbc news website : " i thought this was a great idea .
there 's nothing like it in cardiff at the moment .
" it was definitely a niche market for scooterman so i contacted them . "
the miniature scooter packs easily into a car boot mr hubbard will initially run the franchise on his own , but hopes to employ more drivers in the future .
cardiff is the third city to have the service after london and manchester , where it has been running for eighteen months .
it is also a partner of the government 's anti-drink drive campaign " think ! "
mr hubbard said cardiff was an ideal place for the service with many people commuting into the city centre by car .
customers can book a scooterman over the telephone , who will arrive at the designated time and place on a miniature motorcycle .
" the bike then breaks into four pieces that go into bags and are put in the boot , " said mr hubbard .
" it takes five minutes . "
all drivers with the company have full comprehensive insurance and can drive any car worth up to £ 50,000 .
scooterman 's prices aim to beat the cost of a return taxi ride - one to get home after a night drinking and a second to pick up your car the following day .
" it 's more expensive than a one-way taxi fare , but if you 're looking at going back into town to pick your car up the next day , it 's a lot cheaper .
" and obviously it 's a lot better than losing your licence for drink-driving , " said mr hubbard .

mr rove 's lawyer says his client is happy to co-operate and he says he has received no information to suggest that he is facing prosecution .
the name of cia agent valerie plame was revealed by a journalist in 2003 .
ms plame 's husband is a former diplomat who criticised president george w bush over iraq .
it was alleged a white house source leaked her identity .
indictment the special prosecutor investigating the case called on karl rove to give more evidence and informed him that he was not necessarily going to escape prosecution .
however , his lawyer said his client had not been told he was likely to face indictment .
mr rove has already appeared in front of the grand jury , and his return at this late stage in the investigation is unusual , correspondents say .
as such , the mood surrounding this inquiry has suddenly changed , in a manner deeply worrying for the bush team , says the bbc 's justin webb in washington .
it is not known when mr rove will appear before the grand jury .
the white house had long maintained mr rove had nothing to do with the leak , but reporters have since said he talked about the agent although not by name .

it did not fail to impress , reports simon perry from tokyo .
phone on your finger masaaki fukumoto came up with fingerphone idea japanese mobile operator docomo showed the fruits of some of its research into mobiles with its ubi-wa , a ring that turns your finger into a phone receiver .
ubi-wa has two meanings in japanese - " finger ring " and " speak by finger " - which is exactly what it lets you do .
in noisy places where you can not hear who you are calling , you simply place the ubi-wa bearing finger in the ear .
the ring converts speech sounds to vibrations .
these travel down the bone and into the ear canal , which obligingly turns them back into intelligible speech .
docomo is continuing the development of the ring .
as it shrinks , it will be too small to sport functioning buttons .
the solution is to tap out predefined rhythms with your thumb and the finger that is wearing the ring .
each unique rhythm carries out a different function .
they call this ubibutton .
unlike much research which remains as vapour-ware , this actually works .
having tried it , the call clarity is impressive and it was simple to make and end calls .
hdtv through a power socket shuttling data around homes in the uk can be a problem because few have network cables installed .
without them , delivering reliable , high speed data is tricky .
mitsubishi also showed off liquid crystal displays at ceatec users can turn to wireless networks but thick walls in british homes can mean the signals do not reach all areas of the house , especially when high speeds are needed .
one approach is to route data over electrical wiring already inside the house cabling , a technique named power line communications -lrb- plc -rrb- .
mitsubishi electric showed a plc modem setup that will debut in europe in november .
it is fast enough at 200mbps to distribute high definition tv around the house .
given that any hdtv will need mains power , it has the added advantage of reducing the number of wires running out the back of the tv set .
flexible colour screens often a staple of visions of the future , flexible colour screens that form a display for those on the move are edging closer to reality .
see more futuristic technologies on show at ceatec in japan in pictures two different firms were on show at ceatec , each designed to display different types of information .
the one from fujitsu is designed to display text and static images .
it sees the screen being used in many different situations , such as with a mobile phone .
the need for mobiles to be small means their screens restrict the amount of information that can be displayed .
fujitsu 's approach is to use the phone simply to deliver the information , but have it displayed on a separate , flexible screen .
this brings a far greater area for reading content and images , such as web pages .
the product of five years research , it uses a technology called cholesteric lcd -lrb- chlcd -rrb- .
once the screen has been updated , the image can be held for up to two months without needing further power .
fujitsu hopes it will to be available to the public in 2007-2008 .
for its part , japan 's version of the bbc , national broadcaster nhk , was showing the early stages of what it hopes will be the equivalent , but for displaying video .
on show were three stages of its development .
the first from a few years ago , simply displayed large moving colour blocks on a 24-pixel screen .
the latest working development version was a box , around a metre square , with a mass of cables sprouting from it .
directly out of their labs , it was able to show recognisable but heavily pixelated video footage , this time at a better resolution of 96 pixels .
the last of the three exhibits was a mock-up of what they would like to produce and could be the one that makes it into production .
it was a pull-open version , similar to self-rolling scrolls , that it hopes to have commercially available in five years ' time .
a show like this has so many new developments in it , you end up feeling a bit shell-shocked .
so perhaps it is time to see what is in the shops now , with a trip to the hi-tech shopping nirvana that is the akihabara area of tokyo .

it did not fail to impress , reports simon perry from tokyo .
phone on your finger masaaki fukumoto came up with fingerphone idea japanese mobile operator docomo showed the fruits of some of its research into mobiles with its ubi-wa , a ring that turns your finger into a phone receiver .
ubi-wa has two meanings in japanese - " finger ring " and " speak by finger " - which is exactly what it lets you do .
in noisy places where you can not hear who you are calling , you simply place the ubi-wa bearing finger in the ear .
the ring converts speech sounds to vibrations .
these travel down the bone and into the ear canal , which obligingly turns them back into intelligible speech .
docomo is continuing the development of the ring .
as it shrinks , it will be too small to sport functioning buttons .
the solution is to tap out predefined rhythms with your thumb and the finger that is wearing the ring .
each unique rhythm carries out a different function .
they call this ubibutton .
unlike much research which remains as vapour-ware , this actually works .
having tried it , the call clarity is impressive and it was simple to make and end calls .
hdtv through a power socket shuttling data around homes in the uk can be a problem because few have network cables installed .
without them , delivering reliable , high speed data is tricky .
mitsubishi also showed off liquid crystal displays at ceatec users can turn to wireless networks but thick walls in british homes can mean the signals do not reach all areas of the house , especially when high speeds are needed .
one approach is to route data over electrical wiring already inside the house cabling , a technique named power line communications -lrb- plc -rrb- .
mitsubishi electric showed a plc modem setup that will debut in europe in november .
it is fast enough at 200mbps to distribute high definition tv around the house .
given that any hdtv will need mains power , it has the added advantage of reducing the number of wires running out the back of the tv set .
flexible colour screens often a staple of visions of the future , flexible colour screens that form a display for those on the move are edging closer to reality .
see more futuristic technologies on show at ceatec in japan in pictures two different firms were on show at ceatec , each designed to display different types of information .
the one from fujitsu is designed to display text and static images .
it sees the screen being used in many different situations , such as with a mobile phone .
the need for mobiles to be small means their screens restrict the amount of information that can be displayed .
fujitsu 's approach is to use the phone simply to deliver the information , but have it displayed on a separate , flexible screen .
this brings a far greater area for reading content and images , such as web pages .
the product of five years research , it uses a technology called cholesteric lcd -lrb- chlcd -rrb- .
once the screen has been updated , the image can be held for up to two months without needing further power .
fujitsu hopes it will to be available to the public in 2007-2008 .
for its part , japan 's version of the bbc , national broadcaster nhk , was showing the early stages of what it hopes will be the equivalent , but for displaying video .
on show were three stages of its development .
the first from a few years ago , simply displayed large moving colour blocks on a 24-pixel screen .
the latest working development version was a box , around a metre square , with a mass of cables sprouting from it .
directly out of their labs , it was able to show recognisable but heavily pixelated video footage , this time at a better resolution of 96 pixels .
the last of the three exhibits was a mock-up of what they would like to produce and could be the one that makes it into production .
it was a pull-open version , similar to self-rolling scrolls , that it hopes to have commercially available in five years ' time .
