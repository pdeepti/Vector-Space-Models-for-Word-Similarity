besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2005 germany 's " electricity rebels " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group replaced nuclear with solar power in their town germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider . in april 1986 , ursula sladek lay at home , incapacitated with a broken thigh after a skiing accident .
as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .
and the bigger firms all offer " green " energy , for fear that the marginal but growing interest in environmentally sound energy might pass them by .
" they recognized the zeitgeist , " reese said .
" everyone knows it , though no one in the bigger companies ' press departments would say it to your face . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula sladek ews keeps plugging along , confident that more and more people will choose them as new energy possibilities get on the radar screens of more people who would prefer their power come from renewable , non-nuclear resources .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.04.2005 -pipe- 11:00 utc german growth 0.2 percent in first quarter germany recorded growth of just over 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2005 , owing mainly to its export strength , but future prospects have worsened slightly , the bundesbank said on monday .
" gross domestic product rose slightly in the first quarter of 2005 , in real terms and in seasonally adjusted terms , and more than compensated for the last quarter of 2004 , " when gdp fell 0.2 percent , the german central bank said in its monthly report for april .
" the rise in growth is once again explained by external demand , with exports rising greater than imports in the first two months . "
however internal demand , traditionally the weak point of the german economy , remained disappointing , the bundesbank added .

" gross domestic product rose slightly in the first quarter of 2005 , in real terms and in seasonally adjusted terms , and more than compensated for the last quarter of 2004 , " when gdp fell 0.2 percent , the german central bank said in its monthly report for april .
" the rise in growth is once again explained by external demand , with exports rising greater than imports in the first two months . "
however internal demand , traditionally the weak point of the german economy , remained disappointing , the bundesbank added .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .

" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .

" gross domestic product rose slightly in the first quarter of 2005 , in real terms and in seasonally adjusted terms , and more than compensated for the last quarter of 2004 , " when gdp fell 0.2 percent , the german central bank said in its monthly report for april .
" the rise in growth is once again explained by external demand , with exports rising greater than imports in the first two months . "
however internal demand , traditionally the weak point of the german economy , remained disappointing , the bundesbank added .
diw , one of germany 's leading economic research institutes , is forecasting that gdp increased by 0.7 percent in the first quarter on the back of strong performances from the manufacturing and retail sectors .
but despite the german economy returning to positive growth , the bundesbank said " future prospects had worsened slightly , " pointing to the fact that industrial orders and production had decreased in february compared with january . dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

" i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .

former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "

former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .

on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .

two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .

but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .

two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .

" i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told the handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . "
he said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc .
" it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " he said .
a series of recent opinion polls in france suggests that the constitution will be decisively rejected there on may 29 in what would be a strong rebuke to president jacques chirac and his center-right government .
germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
it has scheduled the vote to ratify the treaty before the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on may 12 - ahead of the french vote - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

" i firmly believe that france , despite the current opinion polls , will vote ' yes ' , " he told the handelsblatt business daily .
fischer said that france 's approval of the first eu constitution was crucial as " the founding nation of the european union . "
he said the only alternative to allowing the treaty to come into force would be to revert to the 2000 treaty of nice , which eu leaders have described as a recipe for deadlock in an expanding bloc .
" it is an illusion to think one could reopen the constitutional package and renegotiate it .
there will not be a better eu constitution in the foreseeable future , " he said .
a series of recent opinion polls in france suggests that the constitution will be decisively rejected there on may 29 in what would be a strong rebuke to president jacques chirac and his center-right government .
germany will not hold a referendum on the constitution but will put it to a vote before parliament .
it has scheduled the vote to ratify the treaty before the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on may 12 - ahead of the french vote - to give its neighbor a boost .
the bundesrat , the upper house , is expected to rubber-stamp it a few weeks later . dw-world.de eu alarmed by threat of french ' non ' the european union struggled saturday to hide a growing sense of alarm that french voters could reject the eu constitution in a ballot next month , in what would be a devastating blow for the expanding bloc .

they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .
and the bigger firms all offer " green " energy , for fear that the marginal but growing interest in environmentally sound energy might pass them by .
" they recognized the zeitgeist , " reese said .
" everyone knows it , though no one in the bigger companies ' press departments would say it to your face . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula sladek ews keeps plugging along , confident that more and more people will choose them as new energy possibilities get on the radar screens of more people who would prefer their power come from renewable , non-nuclear resources . " they 're not just customers to us , but more like comrades-in-arms , " sladek -lrb- photo -rrb- said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors . " nobody put any of the money under investigation into their own pockets , " kanther said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier for hesse , roland koch the money parked in switzerland was later channeled back to the hesse cdu in various installments , with much of it believed to have financed the road to power of hesse 's present-day cdu premier roland koch -lrb- photo -rrb- . the " kohl system " manfred kanther was only one of many cdu leaders who opened up secret accounts during the reign of chancellor kohl .

had the transfers to foreign accounts and back to germany been declared properly , they would have been subject to taxation under current party financing laws . but these laws were not yet in place when kanther opened up the account in switzerland .
as party expert detlef essinger pointed out , that is why kanther feels he has been treated unfairly . " i think the very fact that he ’ s had to appear before the court is like a huge insult and humiliation for him , " essinger said .
" there can be no two ways about it that he does n't feel guilty at all .

" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .

former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .

he then formalized the agreement in a meeting with the other three party leaders in his coalition , deputy prime minister gianfranco fini told journalists . " we have called for a sign of change .
it seems to me we 're going in that direction , " follini said in a statement released by his party .
" a new government is not a victory for us , but an opportunity for the whole government , an opportunity to cultivate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian president carlo azeglio ciamp berlusconi left his official residence shortly after 6:20 p.m.

the 84-year-old president was expected to ask him to form a new government . threat of elections looms the 68-year-old prime minister had threatened to call snap elections if follini and his three ministers choose not to rejoin the fold . " i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea .

he then formalized the agreement in a meeting with the other three party leaders in his coalition , deputy prime minister gianfranco fini told journalists . " we have called for a sign of change .
it seems to me we 're going in that direction , " follini said in a statement released by his party .
" a new government is not a victory for us , but an opportunity for the whole government , an opportunity to cultivate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian president carlo azeglio ciamp berlusconi left his official residence shortly after 6:20 p.m.
cet to travel the short distance to the quirinale palace where he was expected to formally offer his resignation to president carlo azeglio ciampi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the 84-year-old president was expected to ask him to form a new government . threat of elections looms the 68-year-old prime minister had threatened to call snap elections if follini and his three ministers choose not to rejoin the fold . " i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .
the prime minister , whose own forza italia party is italy 's biggest , will have to balance the centrist party 's demands with those of the northern league , which has its power base in industrialized piedmont and lombardy in the north .
italians opposed to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi failing an accord on monday , italy could have faced elections within the 45 to 70 days laid down in the constitution .
political commentators said the most likely date for an election would be in june .
former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "
" leaving things as they are would help neither the coalition nor the country , " he said .
berlusconi , whose mandate runs out in may 2006 , survived six votes of confidence last year . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy relieved , but anger simmers over shooting italy on saturday welcomed back freed italian hostage giuliana sgrena but the joy at her release was marred by the death of a secret agent killed when us troops opened fire on the convoy taking her to safety .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors . " nobody put any of the money under investigation into their own pockets , " kanther said .
" every cent of it went back to the christian democratic party , and that 's the only out-of-court statement you 'll get from me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier for hesse , roland koch the money parked in switzerland was later channeled back to the hesse cdu in various installments , with much of it believed to have financed the road to power of hesse 's present-day cdu premier roland koch -lrb- photo -rrb- . the " kohl system " manfred kanther was only one of many cdu leaders who opened up secret accounts during the reign of chancellor kohl .
depositing huge party funds abroad without their appearing in the books even became known as the " kohl system .

had the transfers to foreign accounts and back to germany been declared properly , they would have been subject to taxation under current party financing laws . but these laws were not yet in place when kanther opened up the account in switzerland .
as party expert detlef essinger pointed out , that is why kanther feels he has been treated unfairly . " i think the very fact that he ’ s had to appear before the court is like a huge insult and humiliation for him , " essinger said .
" there can be no two ways about it that he does n't feel guilty at all . " the sentence exceeded prosecutors ' calls for kanther and weyrauch to pay fines of 72,000 euros and 36,000 euros respectively . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .
schalke and stuttgart both fell , making the fight for second and third place increasingly interesting . dw staff -lrb- jk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern 's dream dies in european thriller bayern munich stumbled at the quarter-final hurdle in the uefa champions league on tuesday despite beating chelsea 3-2 .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

he then formalized the agreement in a meeting with the other three party leaders in his coalition , deputy prime minister gianfranco fini told journalists . " we have called for a sign of change .
it seems to me we 're going in that direction , " follini said in a statement released by his party .
" a new government is not a victory for us , but an opportunity for the whole government , an opportunity to cultivate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian president carlo azeglio ciamp berlusconi left his official residence shortly after 6:20 p.m.
cet to travel the short distance to the quirinale palace where he was expected to formally offer his resignation to president carlo azeglio ciampi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the 84-year-old president was expected to ask him to form a new government . threat of elections looms the 68-year-old prime minister had threatened to call snap elections if follini and his three ministers choose not to rejoin the fold . " i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .
the prime minister , whose own forza italia party is italy 's biggest , will have to balance the centrist party 's demands with those of the northern league , which has its power base in industrialized piedmont and lombardy in the north .
italians opposed to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi failing an accord on monday , italy could have faced elections within the 45 to 70 days laid down in the constitution .
political commentators said the most likely date for an election would be in june .
former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "
" leaving things as they are would help neither the coalition nor the country , " he said .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .

he then formalized the agreement in a meeting with the other three party leaders in his coalition , deputy prime minister gianfranco fini told journalists . " we have called for a sign of change .
it seems to me we 're going in that direction , " follini said in a statement released by his party .
" a new government is not a victory for us , but an opportunity for the whole government , an opportunity to cultivate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian president carlo azeglio ciamp berlusconi left his official residence shortly after 6:20 p.m.

the 84-year-old president was expected to ask him to form a new government . threat of elections looms the 68-year-old prime minister had threatened to call snap elections if follini and his three ministers choose not to rejoin the fold . " i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .
the prime minister , whose own forza italia party is italy 's biggest , will have to balance the centrist party 's demands with those of the northern league , which has its power base in industrialized piedmont and lombardy in the north .
italians opposed to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi failing an accord on monday , italy could have faced elections within the 45 to 70 days laid down in the constitution .
political commentators said the most likely date for an election would be in june .
former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "
" leaving things as they are would help neither the coalition nor the country , " he said .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .
and the bigger firms all offer " green " energy , for fear that the marginal but growing interest in environmentally sound energy might pass them by .
" they recognized the zeitgeist , " reese said .
" everyone knows it , though no one in the bigger companies ' press departments would say it to your face . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula sladek ews keeps plugging along , confident that more and more people will choose them as new energy possibilities get on the radar screens of more people who would prefer their power come from renewable , non-nuclear resources .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .

two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .

but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .

he then formalized the agreement in a meeting with the other three party leaders in his coalition , deputy prime minister gianfranco fini told journalists . " we have called for a sign of change .
it seems to me we 're going in that direction , " follini said in a statement released by his party .
" a new government is not a victory for us , but an opportunity for the whole government , an opportunity to cultivate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian president carlo azeglio ciamp berlusconi left his official residence shortly after 6:20 p.m.
cet to travel the short distance to the quirinale palace where he was expected to formally offer his resignation to president carlo azeglio ciampi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the 84-year-old president was expected to ask him to form a new government . threat of elections looms the 68-year-old prime minister had threatened to call snap elections if follini and his three ministers choose not to rejoin the fold . " i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .
the prime minister , whose own forza italia party is italy 's biggest , will have to balance the centrist party 's demands with those of the northern league , which has its power base in industrialized piedmont and lombardy in the north .
italians opposed to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi failing an accord on monday , italy could have faced elections within the 45 to 70 days laid down in the constitution .
political commentators said the most likely date for an election would be in june .
former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "
" leaving things as they are would help neither the coalition nor the country , " he said .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .

in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .
and the bigger firms all offer " green " energy , for fear that the marginal but growing interest in environmentally sound energy might pass them by .
" they recognized the zeitgeist , " reese said .
" everyone knows it , though no one in the bigger companies ' press departments would say it to your face . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula sladek ews keeps plugging along , confident that more and more people will choose them as new energy possibilities get on the radar screens of more people who would prefer their power come from renewable , non-nuclear resources .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .
and the bigger firms all offer " green " energy , for fear that the marginal but growing interest in environmentally sound energy might pass them by .
" they recognized the zeitgeist , " reese said .
" everyone knows it , though no one in the bigger companies ' press departments would say it to your face . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula sladek ews keeps plugging along , confident that more and more people will choose them as new energy possibilities get on the radar screens of more people who would prefer their power come from renewable , non-nuclear resources .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors .

had the transfers to foreign accounts and back to germany been declared properly , they would have been subject to taxation under current party financing laws . but these laws were not yet in place when kanther opened up the account in switzerland .
as party expert detlef essinger pointed out , that is why kanther feels he has been treated unfairly . " i think the very fact that he ’ s had to appear before the court is like a huge insult and humiliation for him , " essinger said .
" there can be no two ways about it that he does n't feel guilty at all .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors . " nobody put any of the money under investigation into their own pockets , " kanther said .

" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .

former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .

" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

as fallout from the soviet reactor chernobyl rained over europe , sladek pleaded with her kids not to go out in the yard .
they ignored her , and that got her thinking . to counter her feeling of helplessness , sladek , a homemaker , joined forces with other schönau residents and formed parents for a nuclear-free future .
their aim was to put an end to atomic energy .
the group did what they could to raise townspeople 's energy awareness , running competitions to save energy and even approaching the black forest town 's electricity provider , hoping that kraftübertragungswerke rheinfelden -lrb- kwr -rrb- would introduce prices that rewarded customers for frugal energy use . but by showing the parents the door , the stony faces at kwr inadvertently heralded the end of their golden days of providing schönau with electricity .
after 13 years , two town referendums and a successful nationwide campaign to raise funds , the schönau " electricity rebels , " as the press dubbed the citizens ' initiative , became the first german community to buy back their own power grid . " we were n't after the electricity network , " sladek has said .
" in the beginning we just wanted a little support for our idea . " bildunterschrift : schönau 's solar-cell covered church the " rebels " started producing the energy their town needed by building block heating stations and installing solar panels , including outfitting the local protestant church with solar cells .
what they could n't supply themselves they bought .
and in 1999 , elektrizitätswerke schönau -lrb- ews -rrb- went national , a year after the german electricity market was liberalized . with size comes power today , the schönauer initiative heads one of the largest of germany 's half dozen " green " electricity companies and is rapidly on its way to 30,000 customers , according to sladek , now one of ews 's managing directors . " we see ourselves as a political energy organization , " said sladek .
" the aim is n't to earn more but to have more power . "
size is the way to influence , she said . in a country of 80 million people , however , ews schönau 's customer base appears insignificant .
the company does n't advertise , relying instead on word of mouth from satisfied customers to recruit new ones and investing its profits in promoting environmentally friendly electricity sources .
to that end , ews helps customers set up their own environmentally friendly means of producing electricity and pays them for the kilowatts they deliver into the grid .
giants go green bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ews supports energetic young soccer players , too although germany decided to gradually phase out nuclear power , people are n't switching in droves to ews or its " green " competitors .
in the seven years since liberalization , only 5 percent of customers have changed companies at all , according to the electricity industry 's association , vdew .
and green companies only attract between 5 and 10 percent of customers , said peter floyd reese , head of the energy department at verivox , an internet portal that offers consumers energy market information . green electricity does cost more .
currently , an average three-person berlin family spends at least 547 euros -lrb- $ 706 -rrb- yearly on electricity .
the cheapest " green " energy contract , with a firm that also provides energy generated by nuclear plants , would cost them 559 euros .
going to a supplier that only sells green energy would set the family back by 585 euros .
they 'd pay another 20 euros to get their electricity from ews . consumers hold back but it 's not just the cost that keeps germans from going green .
" changing electricity companies is still connected with lots of fear , " sladek said .
people are concerned that their supply could be interrupted if they switch companies , although the law prevents it .
and laziness , too , is a factor , with an overwhelming 900 electricity providers operating in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblis nuclear power plant around 100 of them supply electricity to roughly 80 percent of germany 's customers .
and the bigger firms all offer " green " energy , for fear that the marginal but growing interest in environmentally sound energy might pass them by .
" they recognized the zeitgeist , " reese said .
" everyone knows it , though no one in the bigger companies ' press departments would say it to your face . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula sladek ews keeps plugging along , confident that more and more people will choose them as new energy possibilities get on the radar screens of more people who would prefer their power come from renewable , non-nuclear resources . " they 're not just customers to us , but more like comrades-in-arms , " sladek -lrb- photo -rrb- said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de renewables made in germany at a time when oil prices are at a record high , germany is one of the world 's leaders in developing renewable energy .

the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .

despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .

goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .

for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .

he then formalized the agreement in a meeting with the other three party leaders in his coalition , deputy prime minister gianfranco fini told journalists . " we have called for a sign of change .
it seems to me we 're going in that direction , " follini said in a statement released by his party .
" a new government is not a victory for us , but an opportunity for the whole government , an opportunity to cultivate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian president carlo azeglio ciamp berlusconi left his official residence shortly after 6:20 p.m.

the 84-year-old president was expected to ask him to form a new government . threat of elections looms the 68-year-old prime minister had threatened to call snap elections if follini and his three ministers choose not to rejoin the fold . " i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .
the prime minister , whose own forza italia party is italy 's biggest , will have to balance the centrist party 's demands with those of the northern league , which has its power base in industrialized piedmont and lombardy in the north .
italians opposed to vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi failing an accord on monday , italy could have faced elections within the 45 to 70 days laid down in the constitution .
political commentators said the most likely date for an election would be in june .
former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "
" leaving things as they are would help neither the coalition nor the country , " he said .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

" i 'm convinced that it 's possible to relaunch the center-right in the shortest possible time , " said fini , leader of the national alliance party .
" it 's essential that the hoped-for change in the program and in the government team happens in an incisive and balanced way , " added fini . follini , who is also a deputy prime minister , led his ministers out of the center-right government friday after berlusconi offered only minimal changes in the wake of a resounding defeat in regional elections early this month .
the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .
the prime minister , whose own forza italia party is italy 's biggest , will have to balance the centrist party 's demands with those of the northern league , which has its power base in industrialized piedmont and lombardy in the north .

political commentators said the most likely date for an election would be in june .
former prime minister romano prodi , who rallied the center-left under the banner of the union umbrella group to achieve a major victory in this month 's polls , had pushed for an early poll . some two-thirds of italians however are firmly opposed to snap elections , according to a survey of 1,600 people carried out by the daily corriere della sera last week . the coalition lost six of eight regions it controlled prior to the april 3-4 regional elections , which many saw as a dress rehearsal for a parliamentary vote slated for next year .
follini said late last week that voters had signaled they wanted " profound change " and his party could not pretend that " nothing happened . "
" leaving things as they are would help neither the coalition nor the country , " he said .

the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .
a new government program is also expected to boost the competitiveness of the country 's industry and support large families through a new tax regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 18.04.2005 uefa hopes fade for wolfsburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's marcelinho , left , is acrobatic and scores gamewinners nuremberg edged away from the relegation zone on sunday after securing a 1-0 victory over wolfsburg .
on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors . " nobody put any of the money under investigation into their own pockets , " kanther said .

had the transfers to foreign accounts and back to germany been declared properly , they would have been subject to taxation under current party financing laws . but these laws were not yet in place when kanther opened up the account in switzerland .
as party expert detlef essinger pointed out , that is why kanther feels he has been treated unfairly . " i think the very fact that he ’ s had to appear before the court is like a huge insult and humiliation for him , " essinger said .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

on saturday bremen 's recent troubles at home continued with a 1-0 loss to hertha berlin . nuremberg 's stefan kiessling saved the day for his team after scoring a controversial header which was allowed by referee markus merk .
the goal left wolfsburg in ninth place , and with just five rounds remaining , their chances of climbing to the eighth spot and qualifying for the uefa cup are fading .
in sunday 's other match , vfl bochum beat kaiserslautern 2-1 and remain 16th in the standings with 29 points. one behind 15th-placed borussia moenchengladbach and two behind mainz , who are 14th on 31 points .
on saturday , berlin midfielder marcelinho kicked his hertha to victory , solidifying the team 's dreams of playing in europe next season .
the home field usually makes a difference in the bundesliga , but werder bremen has found out that it does n't guarantee victory .
for the third home game in a row , the reigning champions did not walk off the pitch as winners , losing 1-0 to hertha berlin .
the hero of the match was colorful midfielder marcelinho , who scored in the 30th minute .
the brazilian marcelinho , who speaks little german , was able to express himself after the match on television broadcaster premiere .
" i am very happy about the goal , " were his words in simple , but correct , german .
bremen frustration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's frank fahrenhorst , left , made the mistake that led to the berlin goal in their last three matches at the weser stadium , thomas schaaf 's normally high-scoring club has had problems finding the net .
two weeks ago they scored just one goal in a 2-1 loss to stuttgart .
four weeks back , they played a scoreless draw against mainz .
the problems continued against berlin .
despite dictating the pace of the match , berlin 's defense , particularly interior defender josip simunic , stood firm .
on those occasions where bremen cracked the defensive line , goalkeeper christian fiedler was on the spot and had to more than earn his salary in this match .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's josip simunic , left , was a bulwark in the berlin defense bremen had to do without german international striker miroslav klose .
in his place , schaaf started nelson valdez next to ivan klasnic .
despite some good , but not excellent , chances for bremen in the first 15 minutes , it was obvious that the two do n't play with each other too often .
there were numerous passes between the two that missed their mark .
yet klasnic 's talent came to the fore when he delivered a lightning-speed shot from the left side in the 13th minute .
goalkeeper fiedler could only put his hands in front of his face as he barely parried the ball .
berlin : masters of the counterattack as bremen pushed ahead , berlin sat back and waited to counter .
in the 30th minute , team captain arne friedrich won a ball at midfield and launched a long pass up field .
the man waiting under the ball , marcelinho , benefitted from a defensive mistake by frank fahrenhorst , he took the ball on one bounce , moved into the bremen penalty box and let loose a rocket that screamed into the top of the net .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schaaf has seen his players make numerous mistakes lately , but said on premiere that they are team mistakes .
" certainly there were individual mistakes but we do n't single out someone and say he 's at fault . "
but on this occasion , fahrenhorst made a terrible error in judgment , which just ca n't be done against a man like marcelinho .
for the next 60 minutes , bremen played desperate and disorganized soccer that lacked the creativity that carried them to the bundesliga title last season .
now , bremen , with 50 points , is tied with berlin , although 12 points behind league leader bayern .
berlin , on the other hand , has the champions league on its mind .

besides his suspended sentence , he was also ordered to pay 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,400 -rrb- into the state coffers .
the court also found former financial consultant horst weyrauch guilty of accessory to fraud and fined him 61,200 euros . while it is not illegal for a german political party to have foreign accounts , it is illegal not to include all assets in annual accounting reports .
investigators have been conducting a probe into the financial activities of kanther and two of his assistants for many years now , but have made little progress in clarifying the origins of the hesse funds which kanther himself has frequently declared as donations from jewish benefactors . " nobody put any of the money under investigation into their own pockets , " kanther said .
" every cent of it went back to the christian democratic party , and that 's the only out-of-court statement you 'll get from me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier for hesse , roland koch the money parked in switzerland was later channeled back to the hesse cdu in various installments , with much of it believed to have financed the road to power of hesse 's present-day cdu premier roland koch -lrb- photo -rrb- . the " kohl system " manfred kanther was only one of many cdu leaders who opened up secret accounts during the reign of chancellor kohl .
depositing huge party funds abroad without their appearing in the books even became known as the " kohl system . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentary speaker wolfgang thierse when the social democrats came to power , parliamentary speaker wolfgang thierse -lrb- photo -rrb- imposed a 21 million-euro fine on the national cdu for its illegal resourcefulness on the fiscal front .
had the transfers to foreign accounts and back to germany been declared properly , they would have been subject to taxation under current party financing laws . but these laws were not yet in place when kanther opened up the account in switzerland .
as party expert detlef essinger pointed out , that is why kanther feels he has been treated unfairly . " i think the very fact that he ’ s had to appear before the court is like a huge insult and humiliation for him , " essinger said .
" there can be no two ways about it that he does n't feel guilty at all . " the sentence exceeded prosecutors ' calls for kanther and weyrauch to pay fines of 72,000 euros and 36,000 euros respectively . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .
four major concerns - rwe , e.on , vattenfall europe and enbw - have held a virtual monopoly so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " germany 's electricity and gas providers will be controlled by the state in the future , " german economics minister wolfgang clement said before the bill was passed on friday .
" the new agency will help to make the actions of grid owners more transparent .
we will now have a level of competition in germany that has not existed before . " in general , opposition politicians support the new law , saying that germany desperately needs cheaper energy as it is currently the country with the highest prices . changes still needed ? but dagmar wöhrl , the economic expert for the christian democrats , said the law needs to be modified in order to have any effect .
she said that the current proposal required too much paperwork from companies , such as listing every source of energy separately in customer bills . " i 'm asking myself , ' what 's the point ' ? " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen thumann industry representatives agreed that the law needed to be fine-tuned .
jürgen thumann , president of the federation of german industries , said that the gas sector in particular still had to be made more competitive .
thumann did , however , laud profit incentives for companies who lower their prices . massive investment program government officials are hoping that the law will encourage companies to make investments .
clement said that energy executives have already committed themselves to spending 19 billion euros -lrb- $ 24.5 billion -rrb- on infrastructure upgrades . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy companies have said they will invest in new power plants " it 's the biggest investment program that 's happening in germany right now , " clement said , adding that companies plan to invest 9.7 billion euros in power plants and 9.3 billion euros in power grids by 2010 . while the new law still has to get the approval of germany 's upper house , it is likely to take effect by july 1 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy firms seek new german sources the winter in germany has been cold and the demand for heating oil and gas has risen sharply .

the udc had called for a broad revamp of his policies . berlusconi is now expected to reshuffle his government line-up substantially , introducing several new ministers , and give new impetus to the industry-deprived south of the country - one of the udc 's key demands .

germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to increase competition within the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money . the law will make it easier for smaller energy providers to enter the market as it sets up a mechanism to control fees charged by big companies for using their power lines .

he headed for manaton in devon , to talk to a group of pensioners who are risking court appearances and a visit from the bailiffs , to protest about the level of their bills .
they 're complaining that the council tax now accounts for up to a quarter of their income - and they simply wo n't pay up. watch declan curry 's poll tax debate from manaton in devon in the past two decades , britain has had three different systems for paying for local services such as education and social services the old rates system - based on the notional rental value of your home - was abolished by mrs thatcher and replaced with a flat rate poll-tax .
that was so unpopular that it was quickly replaced by john major , with a council tax system based on the sales value of your home .
homes across the country are now due to be re-valued - and many fear that the long house price boom will push their houses up by at least one tax bracket .
declan heads for dartmoor in this election , the conservatives are promising substantial council tax cuts for pensioners - and the liberal democrats are saying they 'd abolish it altogether , in favour of a local income tax .
labour has made no manifesto promises on tax , but the budget promised a one-off payment of £ 200 for pensioners bbc news online compares the parties ' policies also on breakfast this morning , we talked to the welsh nationalist party , plaid cymru , about its election manifesto. watch our interview in full with simon thomas of plaid cymru and , our political correspondent shaun ley will bring you full news and analysis of the parties ' latest policy announcements .

opponents claim not enough thought or money has been given to the infrastructure to go with houses in the ashford , thames gateway and gatwick areas , in parts of surrey and along the sussex coast .
it is an accusation denied by the government , which says billions are being made available for transport links , schools and health services .
immigration has been another key issue for the region , although it is now unlikely to be as important to the south east as some may think .
a few years ago , so many asylum seekers were arriving in dover on board ferries and through the channel tunnel that the government set up a dispersal programme .
the move meant kent did not have to house any permanent refugees , but dover did have to process asylum seekers when they first arrived before housing was found elsewhere .
' counties split ' it led to tension in the area , but now that numbers of illegal immigrants have dropped to a handful a week , the problem is one of image more than anything else .
and across the south , labour could come under pressure in the rural , pro-hunting areas of dorset , wiltshire and parts of hampshire , where there are votes to be won and lost on the government 's support for farmers and rural communities .
across kent and east sussex , the contest could not be closer .
out of the 27 seats in the two counties , labour and the conservatives both hold 13 and the liberal democrats hold one .
at least nine of those labour seats could be described as marginal , with majorities of less than 5,000 .
many were safe conservative constituencies up until 1997 , and if the tories are to have any hope of regaining power , these are the seats they have to win back .
michael howard has said publicly many times he sees no reason why every seat in kent can not be his on 6 may .
constituency battles health minister steve ladyman looks the most vulnerable of the labour mps with a majority of 1,792 , but he could be helped by the fact that ukip are targeting the thanet south seat and their leading light nigel farage could take away tory support .
and for virtually the last 40 years whichever party has won the dartford and gravesham seats has also won the general election .
both seats are held by labour with majorities of under 5,000 .
the liberal democrats have never done as well as regional opinion polls suggest they should have , but norman baker will be expected to hold on to his lewes seat , and the party believe they have chances in eastbourne , folkestone and mid sussex .
in many parts of the south , the liberal democrats are concentrating efforts on their decapitation policy which aims to unseat some of the leading lights within the conservative party .
they include the west dorset seat of shadow chancellor oliver letwin who has a majority of only 1,414 and theresa may , shadow secretary of state for the family , who currently holds the seat of maidenhead with a majority of 3284 .
but the seat the liberal democrats would love to gain is michael howard 's folkestone constituency .
also standing in folkestone is rodney hylton-potts , winner of itv 's vote for me programme .
his ' get britain back ' party is calling for no immigration , withdrawal from the eu and castration of paedophiles .

they include the west dorset seat of shadow chancellor oliver letwin who has a majority of only 1,414 and theresa may , shadow secretary of state for the family , who currently holds the seat of maidenhead with a majority of 3284 .
but the seat the liberal democrats would love to gain is michael howard 's folkestone constituency .
also standing in folkestone is rodney hylton-potts , winner of itv 's vote for me programme .
his ' get britain back ' party is calling for no immigration , withdrawal from the eu and castration of paedophiles .

congress voted to set up a commission to appoint new members of the court , in a bid to defuse a growing crisis .
the judges were appointed by mr gutierrez 's congressional allies in december , sparking popular discontent .
mr gutierrez and his opponents accuse each other of politicising the supreme court to their own advantage .
as the debates went on in congress , hundreds of police kept watch over about 2,000 people protesting outside .
they were calling for the resignation of mr gutierrez , but he told reporters late on sunday that there was " no possibility " of him stepping down .
deepening crisis over the weekend , thousands of people marched through the streets of quito , banging pans and demanding the president 's resignation .
they defied a state or emergency imposed by mr gutierrez in quito on friday and lifted less than 24 hours later .
protesters have accused the president of behaving like a dictator the trouble began in december , when mr gutierrez first fired the supreme court , alleging that the magistrates were biased against him .
the new court promptly dropped outstanding corruption charges against one of mr gutierrez 's allies , former president abdala bucaram .
mr bucaram 's roldosista party had backed mr gutierrez 's drive to replace the supreme court .
the party also helped to block an opposition attempt to impeach mr gutierrez in november .
opponents say dismissing the judges was part of a government deal to exonerate mr bucaram in return for his political support .
popular protests have forced two presidents out of office since 1997 , but it appears mr gutierrez has no intention of bowing to their demands , says the bbc 's correspondent in the region , hannah hennessy .

friends of the earth said eight out of 10 people it questioned criticised how the authorities dealt with water pollution and illegal dumping .
a total of 962 people across northern ireland were surveyed in the poll by the environmental lobby group .
friends of the earth has called on the government to set up an environmental protection agency .
it said its findings would make " uncomfortable reading " for the department of the environment .
lisa fagan of friends of the earth said the poll was a " useful barometer " of public opinion .
people in ballyclare , bangor , coleraine , doagh , dungannon , larne and portadown were approached .
" the good news is that 98 % of respondents feel that a clean environment is either ' very important ' or ' quite important , ' " ms fagan said .
' serious concerns ' " more worrying is their assessment of the health of our environment : 90 % feel that our water pollution problem is either ' very serious ' or ' quite serious ' , while 92 % describe illegal dumping as ' very serious ' or ' quite serious ' . "
the group said very few people knew how to report a water pollution incident or an illegal dump site .
just 21 % of those interviewed were able to identify the environment and heritage service -lrb- ehs -rrb- as the body responsible for controlling water pollution .
ms fagan said it was evident that this led to delays and under reporting of pollution incidents in a country where raw sewage was still being discharged into the sea and where there were many illegal landfill sites .
anglers were worried about possible future fish kills on 7 april , anglers warned that a disused dump once used by a county antrim council was threatening fish stocks in local streams and rivers .
fishermen said toxic liquid has been streaming from the base of a disused landfill into ditches and streams around the river inver near larne .
the landfill closed because it was illegal to dump household waste there .
the environment and heritage service , part of the doe , said at that time that it had no immediate concerns about the site .

bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home election 2005 -pipe- results -pipe- issues -pipe- the basics -pipe- weblog -pipe- have your say -pipe- england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales election 2005 contents : election 2005 -pipe- results -pipe- issues -pipe- the basics -pipe- weblog -pipe- have your say -pipe- england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales monday , 18 april , 2005 , 07:25 gmt 08:25 uk which party is best for families ?
parties are campaigning for the votes of families with young children as well as pensioners .
labour 's gordon brown will make a speech outlining the party 's policy on education and childcare .
the tories are set to focus on older voters with a pledge to restore the earnings link for pensions .
the latest yougov poll for the daily telegraph has indicated that labour is ahead on 38 % , with the tories on 33 % , the liberal democrats on 22 % and other parties on 7 % .
which of the parties has the best policy for families and retired people ?
will it affect your vote ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : none of the main political parties understand that we need to support young families more , especially as the cost of decent housing is so high .
there are so many young professional couples out there who would make absolutely brilliant parents , yet can not afford to because they have jobs in areas where housing costs are very high .
liam , worcester as a father of young children i want to see vast improvements in education and healthcare , a clampdown on so-called petty crime , less encouragement of drug use and less availability of alcohol .
oh , and more focus on making parents accountable for the actions of their teenage children .
are labour the party to address these issues ?
i think not .
les , essex labour has always had a constant and compassionate policy for families and retired people .
actions speak louder than words and the last eight years are testimony to labour 's commitment to families .
the other parties are trying to discredit labour but this will not stand objective scrutiny .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium which party is best for my family ?
the only party which puts my children 's future ahead of votes today - the greens .
adam , edinburgh if you look at all the party 's manifestoes , the overriding theme is to give plenty to the scroungers , the pensioners and the high earners by squeezing the middle income group .
they are less likely to vote because they are fed up with being screwed all the time .
michael goode , bishop auckland in answer to bev from west sussex : you can stay at home with your young children .
i wanted to do the same thing so i registered as a childminder .
i 'm at home for my child , whilst still working and helping the economy , and at the same time , i 'm creating childcare places for parents who want to go out to work .
julie , uk to julie , uk : i would love to work and have more money .
however , my children 's needs come first .
if you are child minding you can not be spending as much time with your children than if you were not .
unfortunately , the current society looks down on stay-at-home mothers and does not appreciate the help they provide for their children .
c smith , fleet " we have seen evidence of labour turning words into action over the last seven years " chris , surrey childless people who whinge need to remember who it is that will one day grow into the adult doctors , nurses , care workers , radiologists etc. who will look after them in their old age .
are they going to live on an island alone ?
all the political parties need to do more than they are currently promising for families and pensioners .
but at least we have seen evidence of labour turning words into action over the last seven years - something the tories never did .
chris , surrey labour is the party best for families , because they outlined their policy in detail .
justus okwuonu , london i think labour have been the best for families and will continue to be so .
i am a single parent , working and using childcare .
if i was living under a tory government i feel absolutely certain that i would not be working , as there would be no affordable quality childcare .
for years britain lagged behind the rest of western europe in provision for working families and in particular child care and education in the early years , thanks mainly to the tories .
lower income earners and single parents in particular were marginalised and stigmatised by them .
on the one hand we were spongers but on the other hand we did not have the support or the services to enable us to earn a living .
we are providing for the next generation and they in turn will provide for us so if we do n't put the quality services in place for them , society will suffer more in the future .
it 's ridiculous for childless people to complain that they lose out to those with families - should we all stop having kids and then see what happens ?
i certainly do n't complain about my taxes contributing to services for other peoples kids .
sarah , stirling i personally like the conservatives ' policy of offering a choice between 6 and 9 month maternity pay - this will allow individual flexibility whilst making sure that those who need to return to work earlier are n't financially disadvantaged .
the lib dems proposal to scrap the csa is also attractive , considering my personal experience of their incompetence .
overall though , i think the conservatives have the edge , especially as they pledge to restore the link between pensions and earnings .
j , leicester do n't get me wrong , families are important , and i hope to have one myself one day .
but as a single person , working full-time , paying through the nose to live in private rented accommodation because it is impossible to get onto the property ladder , i feel increasingly ignored by politicians .
where 's the help for hard working taxpayers who do n't happen to have children ?
sam , sheffield , uk " i would n't trust the tories to run the economy or the country " stanley chung , stevenage , herts i would n't trust the tories to run the economy or the country .
since labour came to power they have done more for the country than when the tories were in power .
if the people vote the tories in , they will be making a big mistake .
stanley chung , stevenage , herts those who complain about families should consider that families are consumers and drive the economy forward , from the purchase of nappies to placing children in childcare .
how many jobs does this create ?
and how much tax do those people then pay ?
q , surrey it 's all very well banging on about more childcare places but what about supporting parents who want to do what 's best for their young children -lrb- see all the international research -rrb- and stay at home for the first few years ?
bev , west sussex , uk " the current system encourages state dependency and discourages people from working " lance , hertford people seem to assume that because you have children you get lots of state handouts , i frequently have to make it clear to people that as a married couple we get nothing except the basic child benefit and have been penalised by the ni increases , massive council tax hikes etc just like everyone else and have been made considerably worse off given that our salaries have not risen in line with increased taxes .
maybe we should split up if labour gets re-elected ! !
the current system encourages state dependency and discourages people from working .
lance , hertford if i was shacked up with a woman , was unemployed / low paid and had kids i would go for labour / lib dems .
not hard to see how some people prefer the bliss of family life to single tax , toil .
james , cornwall , uk with the labour party taking out the married couple allowance replacing with child tax credit , i will never vote for them .
i do n't work but my husband does .
we do not qualify for child tax credit so this system is not for us .
bring back the married couple allowance and i will vote for them .
salina , watford " the labour tax credits system is just unbelievable " s j waldock , london , uk the labour tax credits system is just unbelievable ; it does nothing for people on a middle income when it comes to childcare , you need to earn less than £ 15,000 per year to benefit .
childcare in london affordable if you earn £ 20,000 ?
i do n't think so .
s j waldock , london , uk lib dems will hurt families more than help them .
their policies are undefined and cater to special segments of the population .
tories offer the best choice .
charlie datuna , hull with so many people complaining about having to pay for other peoples children , i would like to point out that it is those children who will be paying the taxes for your pensions and health care when you 're the drain on society .
vicky , colchester the conservatives claim to be for the family but which one ?
from listening to michael howard 's speeches it would seem only those that can afford to be conservative .
peter wyatt , rochester , uk the tories are the only ones who truly believe in the importance of the family .
statistics show that kids without both parents tend to suffer , so when labour 's policies are making parents contemplate divorce for tax reasons , how can they claim to care for the family ?
harry paget , kent " the lib dems have the best policies for families and retirement because they focus on fairness " david , halesowen of the big three , clearly the lib dems have the best policies for families and retirement because they focus on fairness .
i have four children and their prospects will be dependent upon the affordability of university education .
will if affect my vote ?
no , because my conscience vote is against this labour government and , with this unfair voting system , i can only express my opinion in this constituency by voting for the conservatives .
david , halesowen , england i would be particularly interested to know if any of the parties promise to sort out the complicated way in which child benefit and child tax credits are handled .
our family receives both and we keep getting letters which neither add up nor make any sense .
we find it a very time wasting process and believe it must also be costing the government .
i personally would vote for any party which promised to tackle this problem .
lee hills , nottingham new labour and the lib dems encourage and promote state dependence - this in turn justifies the massive interfering state they dream of controlling .
if you want kids and want them to respect you in later life , then fund them yourself - how can you promote a positive social work ethic to your children if you have lived on handouts all of their lives ?
roger , whitwick , england the tax proposals of veritas would take ten million people out of tax altogether .
this will be of the greatest benefit to hard working families , particularly those who work part time .
david heather , london i am 61 and was made redundant last year .
my home is my own and i receive a small pension which i contributed to from my 21st birthday .
as much as i try i can not get a job and apart from unemployment pay for the first few months the state will give me nothing , i am classed as self sufficient and not in need .
we hear about all the parties wanting to give more to the young and the old , what about us in the middle who have paid all dues and demands throughout our lives and now get nothing ?
charles brockley , norwich , gt .
britain " spongers get richer with every kid they have " steve fenwick , yeovil under labour , the people who are most likely to have responsible children who inherit a work ethic from their responsible parents are the people who are penalised most .
it 's hardly surprising that there is a looming pension crisis .
spongers get richer with every kid they have , while earners get poorer .
steve fenwick , yeovil the way i see it is that governments have to deal with both " causes " and " consequences " .
one consequence faced at the moment is the need for both parents to work to support the family finances .
therefore the children suffer .
labour have come up with their solution which you either agree with or do n't .
as it happens , i do n't .
however , what about the causes and tackling them ?
none of the parties comment at all about that .
it is possible to fish people out of the river , but it is more important to go upstream and see what 's throwing them in to start with .
that is the big issue and its not being addressed .
richard , st albans , england if the computer system mandated by the children act 2004 turns out to be as shambolic as those used for the csa , the tax office or the passport office , the labour party will have been very bad for children indeed .
simon richardson , london i am a 67 year old .
i have brought up my now 13 year old grandson without any " baby bonds " , child assistance etc .
i also looked after my son who has suffered during the past year with cancer , kidney problems and a fractured spine - again without any financial help .
i am also £ 1.50 over the limit to claim tax credit .
if i were to turn them both out on the street , they would be re-housed and would receive many benefits .
this is a " grey area " according to the dhss and needs to be addressed .
i am sure i am not the only one in this situation .
not one representative from any party can give me a reply as to why i can not receive some form of financial help .
margaret wyatt , lancashire my girlfriend and i are in our mid 30 's and we have no kids , we own our own house and both work full time .
it appears that all we will get is more tax to pay for all the families who get a tax credits .
families are the group who will need schools and hospitals so should pay more for the public services .
i would like something back for not being a burden on the public purse , and for not receiving any benefits .
if people ca n't afford to have kids then they should n't have them .
or , benefits should be limited to one child per family .
chris weston , lincolnshire blair and brown have let their personal views as parents have too strong an influence on policy , by diverting too much from those without children , to those with .
it 's time to redress this balance and remember that having children is a lifestyle choice and not something the state should subsidise .
rory , london i understand that some parents wish to stay at home and look after their children , but some do n't .
i love my child but i also like my job .
labour has made it possible for my husband and i to work and afford to have someone professional look after our child while we do .
it makes the time we have together as a family all the more special .
the conservatives want women back in the kitchen - for some that 's fine , but i want more , and i do n't want to be made to feel like a bad parent because of it .
sam may , brechin , scotland unless thousands of the world 's top scientists are wrong , climate change means our kids and grandkids are heading into a monstrous environmental future .
i 'm voting green - people 's obsession with cash bribes to families make me despair of the wit of the average british voter .
denis murphy , birmingham " we 're sick of being forced to subsidise the procreation of others " ian , bradford as a hard working couple without children , we 're sick of being forced to subsidise the procreation of others - especially when the most creative tend to be those with greatest dependence on the state in the first place .
ian , bradford as a serviceman 's wife and mother of three , i would vote for anyone who promises not to pick a war where it does n't need to be fought so our overstretched armed forces can have a breather and spend time with their families .
moving regularly at short notice , i would like to be able to choose a school rather than take the only one in the area with three places !
eliza , bucks with labour we get rising crime and mrsa and the lib dems would abolish mandatory life sentences for murder and rape whilst opening up drugs to more .
a father 's first duty is to safeguard his family , so i will be voting conservative .
chris hunt , ashtead , there are lots of voters out there who do n't have young families .
i brought up my two children in the 70s and 80s as a single parent and paid my way without any benefits .
now that my children are in their thirties , where does that leave me ?
i 'm paying massive amounts of tax and working extremely long hours just to get a half decent standard of living .
i 'm not at all happy at having to pay so much tax to support other people 's children , when i 've already raised my own family .
i took the view that my children were my responsibility , why ca n't today 's families do the same ?
barbara , kent islington council under liberal democrat control have increased the cost of after school and holiday childcare by over 100 % in the last two years .
if this is an example of the lib dems policy then they are most certainly not the best party for families .
andrew berry , islington , london " what about hard working families without young children ? "
andy , bury , lancs what about hard working families without young children ?
all my family work hard , the children are in their 20s and we have no one who will represent us !
andy , bury , lancs due to the nursery vouchers policy i will be over £ 1000 better off this year .
my son will also benefit from the complete rebuilding of his school over the next 2 years .
do n't risk all this investment by bringing the tory cuts back .
it 's their lack of investment that caused the need to rebuild facilities in schools .
mark , ealing what about acknowledging single people and childless couples , rather than wasting our taxes on ' baby bonds ' which many future teenagers will waste on clothes and holidays ?
catherine , flitwick , beds it 's hard to see my grandfather who was a soldier in world war two being treated so badly by the current government in terms of pensions .
the parties need to focus on the family at all times of their lives .
robert taylor , bognor regis " if you want to have children you should expect to make some sacrifices " lm , london my family is far better off now than we were under the tories .
i have decided not to work while my children are still young , but if i wanted to work i would be able to due to the help towards childcare that is now available .
state education has improved massively in the last few years .
schools that i would never have considered sending my children to have been completely turned around .
parents have the choice whether to both work or not .
you do n't have to buy a house !
you could live in a council or housing association property .
owning a house is a not a necessity .
if you want to have children you should expect to make some sacrifices .
lm , london i wo n't be voting labour , i 'm married with two children but ca n't afford to buy a house even though my husband and i earn relatively well .
we have both just been given small pay rises , but no doubt if labour win , it will disappear in a puff of smoke .
lisa , uk my vote will go to whichever party agrees that mothers with children should not have to go to work as well as running the home .
i do not see the point in children having to go to childminders when you could look after them yourself .
i would work part time if i could work within school hours , but this is only possible if you work for a school !
julie , bridlington , east yorkshire " the labour are the anti-family party " andrew fitton , leeds having a stranger bring up a child can not be good for the child or the family .
so why does labour encourage both parents to work , by presiding over the dreadful rise in house prices and rewarding two working parents ?
we should encourage one parent to be there for their offspring .
the labour are the anti-family party .
andrew fitton , leeds you have to consider what you want out of society .
under a labour government you will get more direct pay if you are on a low income , but with a conservative government your children will be safer on the street and get better education due to a reduction in disruptive pupils .
gus eldridge , norwich i 'm a member of a hard working family and i 'm definitely worse off under labour .
martin , uk they all talk about working mums but none of them address stay-at-home mums .
a couple of years ago our joint wage was lower than my husband 's current wage but our take home salary was a lot more .
my husband took a well paid job with longer hours so i could stop work and care for our children .
however , the tax system penalises this by not allowing non-working partners to transfer their tax allowance .
caron , england " i 'm voting for the party that rewards hard work and responsible breeding habits " chris , uk i am in neither of the above groups and so am voting for the party that rewards hard work and responsible breeding habits .
unfortunately , there is n't one .
chris , uk since coming to power , labour has done everything possible to pull the rug from under the conventional , stable , married family .
instead , they have dished out money to all manner of minority groups .
in contrast , the conservatives are proposing long-term support for the traditional family .
i know which way i 'll be voting .
jay w , cheshire as a father of three , i believe it is mine and my wife 's responsibility to raise our children in the best way possible .
to this end my wife gave up work as a teacher to be a full time mum .
the net result of this is that we do n't have the latest wide screen tv or fancy new car as my income is reasonable but not vast .
i feel like i am now paying a considerable chunk of tax to support families who want the new house or new car .
vote conservative and put an end to unreasonable taxation .
jonathan , uxbridge i find it amazing that we can receive £ 450 a month to pay for a stranger to look after our beautiful 5 month old daughter but for my wife to stay at home and raise her , we will only receive child benefit .
rod horwood , aylebury " the problem is all parties expect both parents to work " kev , uk if you mean that children have to be left in a nursery all day so that a mother can slave at work to hand over half her wages to a childminder and the other half to fund a ridiculously high mortgage due to ridiculously high house prices , then i guess the labour party would be the choice .
the problem is all parties expect both parents to work .
surely there is a link between the rise in both parents working and the rise in unruly kids .
kev , uk according to the labour party manifesto , families are on average £ 1400 better off under labour .
i 'm not clear where they derive this figure from .
my wife is a teacher and i work part-time as a computer programmer .
the only benefit we receive for our two children is the universal child benefit which is saved to pay for university costs .
we pay for things like school meals and uniforms out of our own pockets .
we 're happy to do this as it 's our choice to have children but i 'm sick of the labour party suggesting that we live in some sort of tax-friendly family nirvana .
ken , north tyneside the conservatives are promoting long-term financial independence while the rest are increasing dependency and the role of the nanny state .
i 'm a father with very small children .
i do n't see why others should be forced to subsidise me .
vote conservative .
mark , london under labour our family experience has been one of diminished disposable income and an unacceptable level of education in the state system .
any party which intends to increase the tax burden , fails to review the entire failing system of public services and fails to provide assistance for those seeking greater financial freedom to opt out of these failing services has nothing to offer us .
at present it is the conservatives that appear to offer a more attractive view .

parties are campaigning for the votes of families with young children as well as pensioners .
labour 's gordon brown will make a speech outlining the party 's policy on education and childcare .
the tories are set to focus on older voters with a pledge to restore the earnings link for pensions .
the latest yougov poll for the daily telegraph has indicated that labour is ahead on 38 % , with the tories on 33 % , the liberal democrats on 22 % and other parties on 7 % .
which of the parties has the best policy for families and retired people ?
will it affect your vote ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : none of the main political parties understand that we need to support young families more , especially as the cost of decent housing is so high .
there are so many young professional couples out there who would make absolutely brilliant parents , yet can not afford to because they have jobs in areas where housing costs are very high .
liam , worcester as a father of young children i want to see vast improvements in education and healthcare , a clampdown on so-called petty crime , less encouragement of drug use and less availability of alcohol .
oh , and more focus on making parents accountable for the actions of their teenage children .
are labour the party to address these issues ?
i think not .
les , essex labour has always had a constant and compassionate policy for families and retired people .
actions speak louder than words and the last eight years are testimony to labour 's commitment to families .
the other parties are trying to discredit labour but this will not stand objective scrutiny .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium which party is best for my family ?
the only party which puts my children 's future ahead of votes today - the greens .
adam , edinburgh if you look at all the party 's manifestoes , the overriding theme is to give plenty to the scroungers , the pensioners and the high earners by squeezing the middle income group .
they are less likely to vote because they are fed up with being screwed all the time .
michael goode , bishop auckland in answer to bev from west sussex : you can stay at home with your young children .
i wanted to do the same thing so i registered as a childminder .
i 'm at home for my child , whilst still working and helping the economy , and at the same time , i 'm creating childcare places for parents who want to go out to work .
julie , uk to julie , uk : i would love to work and have more money .
however , my children 's needs come first .
if you are child minding you can not be spending as much time with your children than if you were not .
unfortunately , the current society looks down on stay-at-home mothers and does not appreciate the help they provide for their children .
c smith , fleet we have seen evidence of labour turning words into action over the last seven years chris , surrey childless people who whinge need to remember who it is that will one day grow into the adult doctors , nurses , care workers , radiologists etc. who will look after them in their old age .
are they going to live on an island alone ?
all the political parties need to do more than they are currently promising for families and pensioners .
but at least we have seen evidence of labour turning words into action over the last seven years - something the tories never did .
chris , surrey labour is the party best for families , because they outlined their policy in detail .
justus okwuonu , london i think labour have been the best for families and will continue to be so .
i am a single parent , working and using childcare .
if i was living under a tory government i feel absolutely certain that i would not be working , as there would be no affordable quality childcare .
for years britain lagged behind the rest of western europe in provision for working families and in particular child care and education in the early years , thanks mainly to the tories .
lower income earners and single parents in particular were marginalised and stigmatised by them .
on the one hand we were spongers but on the other hand we did not have the support or the services to enable us to earn a living .
we are providing for the next generation and they in turn will provide for us so if we do n't put the quality services in place for them , society will suffer more in the future .
it 's ridiculous for childless people to complain that they lose out to those with families - should we all stop having kids and then see what happens ?
i certainly do n't complain about my taxes contributing to services for other peoples kids .
sarah , stirling i personally like the conservatives ' policy of offering a choice between 6 and 9 month maternity pay - this will allow individual flexibility whilst making sure that those who need to return to work earlier are n't financially disadvantaged .
the lib dems proposal to scrap the csa is also attractive , considering my personal experience of their incompetence .
overall though , i think the conservatives have the edge , especially as they pledge to restore the link between pensions and earnings .
j , leicester do n't get me wrong , families are important , and i hope to have one myself one day .
but as a single person , working full-time , paying through the nose to live in private rented accommodation because it is impossible to get onto the property ladder , i feel increasingly ignored by politicians .
where 's the help for hard working taxpayers who do n't happen to have children ?
sam , sheffield , uk i would n't trust the tories to run the economy or the country stanley chung , stevenage , herts i would n't trust the tories to run the economy or the country .
since labour came to power they have done more for the country than when the tories were in power .
if the people vote the tories in , they will be making a big mistake .
stanley chung , stevenage , herts those who complain about families should consider that families are consumers and drive the economy forward , from the purchase of nappies to placing children in childcare .
how many jobs does this create ?
and how much tax do those people then pay ?
q , surrey it 's all very well banging on about more childcare places but what about supporting parents who want to do what 's best for their young children -lrb- see all the international research -rrb- and stay at home for the first few years ?
bev , west sussex , uk the current system encourages state dependency and discourages people from working lance , hertford people seem to assume that because you have children you get lots of state handouts , i frequently have to make it clear to people that as a married couple we get nothing except the basic child benefit and have been penalised by the ni increases , massive council tax hikes etc just like everyone else and have been made considerably worse off given that our salaries have not risen in line with increased taxes .
maybe we should split up if labour gets re-elected ! !
the current system encourages state dependency and discourages people from working .
lance , hertford if i was shacked up with a woman , was unemployed / low paid and had kids i would go for labour / lib dems .
not hard to see how some people prefer the bliss of family life to single tax , toil .
james , cornwall , uk with the labour party taking out the married couple allowance replacing with child tax credit , i will never vote for them .
i do n't work but my husband does .
we do not qualify for child tax credit so this system is not for us .
bring back the married couple allowance and i will vote for them .
salina , watford the labour tax credits system is just unbelievable s j waldock , london , uk the labour tax credits system is just unbelievable ; it does nothing for people on a middle income when it comes to childcare , you need to earn less than £ 15,000 per year to benefit .
childcare in london affordable if you earn £ 20,000 ?
i do n't think so .
s j waldock , london , uk lib dems will hurt families more than help them .
their policies are undefined and cater to special segments of the population .
tories offer the best choice .
charlie datuna , hull with so many people complaining about having to pay for other peoples children , i would like to point out that it is those children who will be paying the taxes for your pensions and health care when you 're the drain on society .
vicky , colchester the conservatives claim to be for the family but which one ?
from listening to michael howard 's speeches it would seem only those that can afford to be conservative .
peter wyatt , rochester , uk the tories are the only ones who truly believe in the importance of the family .
statistics show that kids without both parents tend to suffer , so when labour 's policies are making parents contemplate divorce for tax reasons , how can they claim to care for the family ?
harry paget , kent the lib dems have the best policies for families and retirement because they focus on fairness david , halesowen of the big three , clearly the lib dems have the best policies for families and retirement because they focus on fairness .
i have four children and their prospects will be dependent upon the affordability of university education .
will if affect my vote ?
no , because my conscience vote is against this labour government and , with this unfair voting system , i can only express my opinion in this constituency by voting for the conservatives .
david , halesowen , england i would be particularly interested to know if any of the parties promise to sort out the complicated way in which child benefit and child tax credits are handled .
our family receives both and we keep getting letters which neither add up nor make any sense .
we find it a very time wasting process and believe it must also be costing the government .
i personally would vote for any party which promised to tackle this problem .
lee hills , nottingham new labour and the lib dems encourage and promote state dependence - this in turn justifies the massive interfering state they dream of controlling .
if you want kids and want them to respect you in later life , then fund them yourself - how can you promote a positive social work ethic to your children if you have lived on handouts all of their lives ?
roger , whitwick , england the tax proposals of veritas would take ten million people out of tax altogether .
this will be of the greatest benefit to hard working families , particularly those who work part time .
david heather , london i am 61 and was made redundant last year .
my home is my own and i receive a small pension which i contributed to from my 21st birthday .
as much as i try i can not get a job and apart from unemployment pay for the first few months the state will give me nothing , i am classed as self sufficient and not in need .
we hear about all the parties wanting to give more to the young and the old , what about us in the middle who have paid all dues and demands throughout our lives and now get nothing ?

i also looked after my son who has suffered during the past year with cancer , kidney problems and a fractured spine - again without any financial help .
i am also £ 1.50 over the limit to claim tax credit .

this is a " grey area " according to the dhss and needs to be addressed .
i am sure i am not the only one in this situation .
not one representative from any party can give me a reply as to why i can not receive some form of financial help .
margaret wyatt , lancashire my girlfriend and i are in our mid 30 's and we have no kids , we own our own house and both work full time .
it appears that all we will get is more tax to pay for all the families who get a tax credits .
families are the group who will need schools and hospitals so should pay more for the public services .
i would like something back for not being a burden on the public purse , and for not receiving any benefits .
if people ca n't afford to have kids then they should n't have them .
or , benefits should be limited to one child per family .

gus eldridge , norwich i 'm a member of a hard working family and i 'm definitely worse off under labour .
martin , uk they all talk about working mums but none of them address stay-at-home mums .
a couple of years ago our joint wage was lower than my husband 's current wage but our take home salary was a lot more .
my husband took a well paid job with longer hours so i could stop work and care for our children .
however , the tax system penalises this by not allowing non-working partners to transfer their tax allowance .
caron , england i 'm voting for the party that rewards hard work and responsible breeding habits chris , uk i am in neither of the above groups and so am voting for the party that rewards hard work and responsible breeding habits .
unfortunately , there is n't one .
chris , uk since coming to power , labour has done everything possible to pull the rug from under the conventional , stable , married family .
instead , they have dished out money to all manner of minority groups .
in contrast , the conservatives are proposing long-term support for the traditional family .
i know which way i 'll be voting .
jay w , cheshire as a father of three , i believe it is mine and my wife 's responsibility to raise our children in the best way possible .
to this end my wife gave up work as a teacher to be a full time mum .
the net result of this is that we do n't have the latest wide screen tv or fancy new car as my income is reasonable but not vast .
i feel like i am now paying a considerable chunk of tax to support families who want the new house or new car .
vote conservative and put an end to unreasonable taxation .
jonathan , uxbridge i find it amazing that we can receive £ 450 a month to pay for a stranger to look after our beautiful 5 month old daughter but for my wife to stay at home and raise her , we will only receive child benefit .
rod horwood , aylebury the problem is all parties expect both parents to work kev , uk if you mean that children have to be left in a nursery all day so that a mother can slave at work to hand over half her wages to a childminder and the other half to fund a ridiculously high mortgage due to ridiculously high house prices , then i guess the labour party would be the choice .
the problem is all parties expect both parents to work .
surely there is a link between the rise in both parents working and the rise in unruly kids .
kev , uk according to the labour party manifesto , families are on average £ 1400 better off under labour .
i 'm not clear where they derive this figure from .
my wife is a teacher and i work part-time as a computer programmer .
the only benefit we receive for our two children is the universal child benefit which is saved to pay for university costs .
we pay for things like school meals and uniforms out of our own pockets .
we 're happy to do this as it 's our choice to have children but i 'm sick of the labour party suggesting that we live in some sort of tax-friendly family nirvana .
ken , north tyneside the conservatives are promoting long-term financial independence while the rest are increasing dependency and the role of the nanny state .
i 'm a father with very small children .
i do n't see why others should be forced to subsidise me .
vote conservative .
mark , london under labour our family experience has been one of diminished disposable income and an unacceptable level of education in the state system .
any party which intends to increase the tax burden , fails to review the entire failing system of public services and fails to provide assistance for those seeking greater financial freedom to opt out of these failing services has nothing to offer us .
at present it is the conservatives that appear to offer a more attractive view .

parties are campaigning for the votes of families with young children as well as pensioners .
labour 's gordon brown will make a speech outlining the party 's policy on education and childcare .
the tories are set to focus on older voters with a pledge to restore the earnings link for pensions .
the latest yougov poll for the daily telegraph has indicated that labour is ahead on 38 % , with the tories on 33 % , the liberal democrats on 22 % and other parties on 7 % .
which of the parties has the best policy for families and retired people ?
will it affect your vote ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : none of the main political parties understand that we need to support young families more , especially as the cost of decent housing is so high .
there are so many young professional couples out there who would make absolutely brilliant parents , yet can not afford to because they have jobs in areas where housing costs are very high .
liam , worcester as a father of young children i want to see vast improvements in education and healthcare , a clampdown on so-called petty crime , less encouragement of drug use and less availability of alcohol .
oh , and more focus on making parents accountable for the actions of their teenage children .
are labour the party to address these issues ?
i think not .
les , essex labour has always had a constant and compassionate policy for families and retired people .
actions speak louder than words and the last eight years are testimony to labour 's commitment to families .
the other parties are trying to discredit labour but this will not stand objective scrutiny .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium which party is best for my family ?
the only party which puts my children 's future ahead of votes today - the greens .
adam , edinburgh if you look at all the party 's manifestoes , the overriding theme is to give plenty to the scroungers , the pensioners and the high earners by squeezing the middle income group .
they are less likely to vote because they are fed up with being screwed all the time .
michael goode , bishop auckland in answer to bev from west sussex : you can stay at home with your young children .
i wanted to do the same thing so i registered as a childminder .
i 'm at home for my child , whilst still working and helping the economy , and at the same time , i 'm creating childcare places for parents who want to go out to work .
julie , uk to julie , uk : i would love to work and have more money .
however , my children 's needs come first .
if you are child minding you can not be spending as much time with your children than if you were not .
unfortunately , the current society looks down on stay-at-home mothers and does not appreciate the help they provide for their children .
c smith , fleet we have seen evidence of labour turning words into action over the last seven years chris , surrey childless people who whinge need to remember who it is that will one day grow into the adult doctors , nurses , care workers , radiologists etc. who will look after them in their old age .
are they going to live on an island alone ?
all the political parties need to do more than they are currently promising for families and pensioners .
but at least we have seen evidence of labour turning words into action over the last seven years - something the tories never did .
chris , surrey labour is the party best for families , because they outlined their policy in detail .
justus okwuonu , london i think labour have been the best for families and will continue to be so .
i am a single parent , working and using childcare .
if i was living under a tory government i feel absolutely certain that i would not be working , as there would be no affordable quality childcare .
for years britain lagged behind the rest of western europe in provision for working families and in particular child care and education in the early years , thanks mainly to the tories .
lower income earners and single parents in particular were marginalised and stigmatised by them .
on the one hand we were spongers but on the other hand we did not have the support or the services to enable us to earn a living .
we are providing for the next generation and they in turn will provide for us so if we do n't put the quality services in place for them , society will suffer more in the future .
it 's ridiculous for childless people to complain that they lose out to those with families - should we all stop having kids and then see what happens ?
i certainly do n't complain about my taxes contributing to services for other peoples kids .
sarah , stirling i personally like the conservatives ' policy of offering a choice between 6 and 9 month maternity pay - this will allow individual flexibility whilst making sure that those who need to return to work earlier are n't financially disadvantaged .
the lib dems proposal to scrap the csa is also attractive , considering my personal experience of their incompetence .
overall though , i think the conservatives have the edge , especially as they pledge to restore the link between pensions and earnings .
j , leicester do n't get me wrong , families are important , and i hope to have one myself one day .
but as a single person , working full-time , paying through the nose to live in private rented accommodation because it is impossible to get onto the property ladder , i feel increasingly ignored by politicians .
where 's the help for hard working taxpayers who do n't happen to have children ?
sam , sheffield , uk i would n't trust the tories to run the economy or the country stanley chung , stevenage , herts i would n't trust the tories to run the economy or the country .
since labour came to power they have done more for the country than when the tories were in power .
if the people vote the tories in , they will be making a big mistake .
stanley chung , stevenage , herts those who complain about families should consider that families are consumers and drive the economy forward , from the purchase of nappies to placing children in childcare .
how many jobs does this create ?
and how much tax do those people then pay ?
q , surrey it 's all very well banging on about more childcare places but what about supporting parents who want to do what 's best for their young children -lrb- see all the international research -rrb- and stay at home for the first few years ?
bev , west sussex , uk the current system encourages state dependency and discourages people from working lance , hertford people seem to assume that because you have children you get lots of state handouts , i frequently have to make it clear to people that as a married couple we get nothing except the basic child benefit and have been penalised by the ni increases , massive council tax hikes etc just like everyone else and have been made considerably worse off given that our salaries have not risen in line with increased taxes .
maybe we should split up if labour gets re-elected ! !
the current system encourages state dependency and discourages people from working .
lance , hertford if i was shacked up with a woman , was unemployed / low paid and had kids i would go for labour / lib dems .
not hard to see how some people prefer the bliss of family life to single tax , toil .
james , cornwall , uk with the labour party taking out the married couple allowance replacing with child tax credit , i will never vote for them .
i do n't work but my husband does .
we do not qualify for child tax credit so this system is not for us .
bring back the married couple allowance and i will vote for them .
salina , watford the labour tax credits system is just unbelievable s j waldock , london , uk the labour tax credits system is just unbelievable ; it does nothing for people on a middle income when it comes to childcare , you need to earn less than £ 15,000 per year to benefit .
childcare in london affordable if you earn £ 20,000 ?
i do n't think so .
s j waldock , london , uk lib dems will hurt families more than help them .
their policies are undefined and cater to special segments of the population .
tories offer the best choice .
charlie datuna , hull with so many people complaining about having to pay for other peoples children , i would like to point out that it is those children who will be paying the taxes for your pensions and health care when you 're the drain on society .
vicky , colchester the conservatives claim to be for the family but which one ?
from listening to michael howard 's speeches it would seem only those that can afford to be conservative .
peter wyatt , rochester , uk the tories are the only ones who truly believe in the importance of the family .
statistics show that kids without both parents tend to suffer , so when labour 's policies are making parents contemplate divorce for tax reasons , how can they claim to care for the family ?
harry paget , kent the lib dems have the best policies for families and retirement because they focus on fairness david , halesowen of the big three , clearly the lib dems have the best policies for families and retirement because they focus on fairness .
i have four children and their prospects will be dependent upon the affordability of university education .
will if affect my vote ?
no , because my conscience vote is against this labour government and , with this unfair voting system , i can only express my opinion in this constituency by voting for the conservatives .
david , halesowen , england i would be particularly interested to know if any of the parties promise to sort out the complicated way in which child benefit and child tax credits are handled .
our family receives both and we keep getting letters which neither add up nor make any sense .
we find it a very time wasting process and believe it must also be costing the government .
i personally would vote for any party which promised to tackle this problem .
lee hills , nottingham new labour and the lib dems encourage and promote state dependence - this in turn justifies the massive interfering state they dream of controlling .
if you want kids and want them to respect you in later life , then fund them yourself - how can you promote a positive social work ethic to your children if you have lived on handouts all of their lives ?
roger , whitwick , england the tax proposals of veritas would take ten million people out of tax altogether .
this will be of the greatest benefit to hard working families , particularly those who work part time .
david heather , london i am 61 and was made redundant last year .
my home is my own and i receive a small pension which i contributed to from my 21st birthday .
as much as i try i can not get a job and apart from unemployment pay for the first few months the state will give me nothing , i am classed as self sufficient and not in need .
we hear about all the parties wanting to give more to the young and the old , what about us in the middle who have paid all dues and demands throughout our lives and now get nothing ?
charles brockley , norwich , gt .
britain spongers get richer with every kid they have steve fenwick , yeovil under labour , the people who are most likely to have responsible children who inherit a work ethic from their responsible parents are the people who are penalised most .
it 's hardly surprising that there is a looming pension crisis .
spongers get richer with every kid they have , while earners get poorer .
steve fenwick , yeovil the way i see it is that governments have to deal with both " causes " and " consequences " .
one consequence faced at the moment is the need for both parents to work to support the family finances .
therefore the children suffer .
labour have come up with their solution which you either agree with or do n't .
as it happens , i do n't .
however , what about the causes and tackling them ?
none of the parties comment at all about that .
it is possible to fish people out of the river , but it is more important to go upstream and see what 's throwing them in to start with .
that is the big issue and its not being addressed .
richard , st albans , england if the computer system mandated by the children act 2004 turns out to be as shambolic as those used for the csa , the tax office or the passport office , the labour party will have been very bad for children indeed .
simon richardson , london i am a 67 year old .
i have brought up my now 13 year old grandson without any " baby bonds " , child assistance etc .
i also looked after my son who has suffered during the past year with cancer , kidney problems and a fractured spine - again without any financial help .
i am also £ 1.50 over the limit to claim tax credit .
if i were to turn them both out on the street , they would be re-housed and would receive many benefits .
this is a " grey area " according to the dhss and needs to be addressed .
i am sure i am not the only one in this situation .
not one representative from any party can give me a reply as to why i can not receive some form of financial help .
margaret wyatt , lancashire my girlfriend and i are in our mid 30 's and we have no kids , we own our own house and both work full time .
it appears that all we will get is more tax to pay for all the families who get a tax credits .
families are the group who will need schools and hospitals so should pay more for the public services .
i would like something back for not being a burden on the public purse , and for not receiving any benefits .
if people ca n't afford to have kids then they should n't have them .
or , benefits should be limited to one child per family .
chris weston , lincolnshire blair and brown have let their personal views as parents have too strong an influence on policy , by diverting too much from those without children , to those with .
it 's time to redress this balance and remember that having children is a lifestyle choice and not something the state should subsidise .
rory , london i understand that some parents wish to stay at home and look after their children , but some do n't .
i love my child but i also like my job .
labour has made it possible for my husband and i to work and afford to have someone professional look after our child while we do .
it makes the time we have together as a family all the more special .
the conservatives want women back in the kitchen - for some that 's fine , but i want more , and i do n't want to be made to feel like a bad parent because of it .
sam may , brechin , scotland unless thousands of the world 's top scientists are wrong , climate change means our kids and grandkids are heading into a monstrous environmental future .
i 'm voting green - people 's obsession with cash bribes to families make me despair of the wit of the average british voter .
denis murphy , birmingham we 're sick of being forced to subsidise the procreation of others ian , bradford as a hard working couple without children , we 're sick of being forced to subsidise the procreation of others - especially when the most creative tend to be those with greatest dependence on the state in the first place .
ian , bradford as a serviceman 's wife and mother of three , i would vote for anyone who promises not to pick a war where it does n't need to be fought so our overstretched armed forces can have a breather and spend time with their families .
moving regularly at short notice , i would like to be able to choose a school rather than take the only one in the area with three places !
eliza , bucks with labour we get rising crime and mrsa and the lib dems would abolish mandatory life sentences for murder and rape whilst opening up drugs to more .
a father 's first duty is to safeguard his family , so i will be voting conservative .
chris hunt , ashtead , there are lots of voters out there who do n't have young families .
i brought up my two children in the 70s and 80s as a single parent and paid my way without any benefits .
now that my children are in their thirties , where does that leave me ?
i 'm paying massive amounts of tax and working extremely long hours just to get a half decent standard of living .
i 'm not at all happy at having to pay so much tax to support other people 's children , when i 've already raised my own family .
i took the view that my children were my responsibility , why ca n't today 's families do the same ?
barbara , kent islington council under liberal democrat control have increased the cost of after school and holiday childcare by over 100 % in the last two years .
if this is an example of the lib dems policy then they are most certainly not the best party for families .
andrew berry , islington , london what about hard working families without young children ?
andy , bury , lancs what about hard working families without young children ?
all my family work hard , the children are in their 20s and we have no one who will represent us !
andy , bury , lancs due to the nursery vouchers policy i will be over £ 1000 better off this year .
my son will also benefit from the complete rebuilding of his school over the next 2 years .
do n't risk all this investment by bringing the tory cuts back .
it 's their lack of investment that caused the need to rebuild facilities in schools .
mark , ealing what about acknowledging single people and childless couples , rather than wasting our taxes on ' baby bonds ' which many future teenagers will waste on clothes and holidays ?
catherine , flitwick , beds it 's hard to see my grandfather who was a soldier in world war two being treated so badly by the current government in terms of pensions .
the parties need to focus on the family at all times of their lives .
robert taylor , bognor regis if you want to have children you should expect to make some sacrifices lm , london my family is far better off now than we were under the tories .
i have decided not to work while my children are still young , but if i wanted to work i would be able to due to the help towards childcare that is now available .
state education has improved massively in the last few years .
schools that i would never have considered sending my children to have been completely turned around .
parents have the choice whether to both work or not .
you do n't have to buy a house !
you could live in a council or housing association property .
owning a house is a not a necessity .
if you want to have children you should expect to make some sacrifices .
lm , london i wo n't be voting labour , i 'm married with two children but ca n't afford to buy a house even though my husband and i earn relatively well .
we have both just been given small pay rises , but no doubt if labour win , it will disappear in a puff of smoke .
lisa , uk my vote will go to whichever party agrees that mothers with children should not have to go to work as well as running the home .
i do not see the point in children having to go to childminders when you could look after them yourself .
i would work part time if i could work within school hours , but this is only possible if you work for a school !
julie , bridlington , east yorkshire the labour are the anti-family party andrew fitton , leeds having a stranger bring up a child can not be good for the child or the family .
so why does labour encourage both parents to work , by presiding over the dreadful rise in house prices and rewarding two working parents ?
we should encourage one parent to be there for their offspring .
the labour are the anti-family party .
andrew fitton , leeds you have to consider what you want out of society .
under a labour government you will get more direct pay if you are on a low income , but with a conservative government your children will be safer on the street and get better education due to a reduction in disruptive pupils .
gus eldridge , norwich i 'm a member of a hard working family and i 'm definitely worse off under labour .
martin , uk they all talk about working mums but none of them address stay-at-home mums .
a couple of years ago our joint wage was lower than my husband 's current wage but our take home salary was a lot more .
my husband took a well paid job with longer hours so i could stop work and care for our children .

rod horwood , aylebury the problem is all parties expect both parents to work kev , uk if you mean that children have to be left in a nursery all day so that a mother can slave at work to hand over half her wages to a childminder and the other half to fund a ridiculously high mortgage due to ridiculously high house prices , then i guess the labour party would be the choice .

now turning his attention to titles for handsets , his current venture is called digital chocolate and , he says , has a very different approach to mobiles .
" a lot of people have the wrong reference point about what has happened before , " he said .
mr hawkins said mobile phones had unique features yet to be exploited .
" some see a mobile as a tiny tv , others want to put a pc in there and , to the game industry , it 's a gimpy gameboy , " he said .
game firms should be trying to exploit the new opportunities that phones offer rather than try to do the same old things , he says .
different strokes mobile gamers are less interested in better and better graphics and more in the social side of the experience , he said .
" they are willing to adopt these forms of media because they can control how they use it .
" people are giving up fidelity in exchange for personalisation , for a feeling of ownership . "
this is the dawn of man and nothing has really happened yet trip hawkins evidence for this comes in the popularity of ringtones , wallpapers , text and multimedia messages .
" these have become a surprisingly big deal and have taken a lot of people by surprise and none of them are a telephone call .
" this first generation is fairly static and you are not really interacting with it .
nut that 's about to change .
" the next generation will have a lot more involvement with it . "
future programs could include tamagotchi-type creatures that live in a phone that people raise and care for .
another could be an island or castle that an owner builds and decorates themselves .
gamers could get rewards for spending so much time caring for their castle , island or creature .
" these help to build a relationship with phone , so it 's not just a lump of metal , " he argued .
social work the popularity of the mobile is also due to the fact that it lets people connect with others .
as a technology the mobile phone is helping to shorten the distance that life inserts between friends and families , he believes .
" we are all accustomed to tremendous social intimacy but a lot of that been lost over last couple of hundred years .
" now people have a tremendous need to re-establish they social links and rebuild that intimacy that was lost .
" a mobile phone is a better way to do that , because its always with you and means you do not have to define your social life as the time you are sitting in front of your computer . "
games on mobiles are just getting started the future then for mr hawkins are games and programs that let people connect , on their own terms , with anyone and everyone else .
mobile gaming leagues are a good example of how this will play out , said mr hawkins .
a surprisingly large number of people who play mobile games sign up for these online leagues , he said .
he describes the ranking systems as " massively single player gaming " because although people play by themselves they can see how they measure up against others .

mr hawkins said mobile phones had unique features yet to be exploited .
" some see a mobile as a tiny tv , others want to put a pc in there and , to the game industry , it 's a gimpy gameboy , " he said .
game firms should be trying to exploit the new opportunities that phones offer rather than try to do the same old things , he says .

another could be an island or castle that an owner builds and decorates themselves .
gamers could get rewards for spending so much time caring for their castle , island or creature .
" these help to build a relationship with phone , so it 's not just a lump of metal , " he argued .
social work the popularity of the mobile is also due to the fact that it lets people connect with others .
as a technology the mobile phone is helping to shorten the distance that life inserts between friends and families , he believes .
" we are all accustomed to tremendous social intimacy but a lot of that been lost over last couple of hundred years .
" now people have a tremendous need to re-establish they social links and rebuild that intimacy that was lost .
" a mobile phone is a better way to do that , because its always with you and means you do not have to define your social life as the time you are sitting in front of your computer . "
games on mobiles are just getting started the future then for mr hawkins are games and programs that let people connect , on their own terms , with anyone and everyone else .
mobile gaming leagues are a good example of how this will play out , said mr hawkins .
a surprisingly large number of people who play mobile games sign up for these online leagues , he said .

now turning his attention to titles for handsets , his current venture is called digital chocolate and , he says , has a very different approach to mobiles .
" a lot of people have the wrong reference point about what has happened before , " he said .
mr hawkins said mobile phones had unique features yet to be exploited .
" some see a mobile as a tiny tv , others want to put a pc in there and , to the game industry , it 's a gimpy gameboy , " he said .
game firms should be trying to exploit the new opportunities that phones offer rather than try to do the same old things , he says .
different strokes mobile gamers are less interested in better and better graphics and more in the social side of the experience , he said .

" people are giving up fidelity in exchange for personalisation , for a feeling of ownership . "
this is the dawn of man and nothing has really happened yet trip hawkins evidence for this comes in the popularity of ringtones , wallpapers , text and multimedia messages .

" the next generation will have a lot more involvement with it . "
future programs could include tamagotchi-type creatures that live in a phone that people raise and care for .
another could be an island or castle that an owner builds and decorates themselves .
gamers could get rewards for spending so much time caring for their castle , island or creature .
" these help to build a relationship with phone , so it 's not just a lump of metal , " he argued .
social work the popularity of the mobile is also due to the fact that it lets people connect with others .
as a technology the mobile phone is helping to shorten the distance that life inserts between friends and families , he believes .
" we are all accustomed to tremendous social intimacy but a lot of that been lost over last couple of hundred years .
" now people have a tremendous need to re-establish they social links and rebuild that intimacy that was lost .
" a mobile phone is a better way to do that , because its always with you and means you do not have to define your social life as the time you are sitting in front of your computer . "
games on mobiles are just getting started the future then for mr hawkins are games and programs that let people connect , on their own terms , with anyone and everyone else .
mobile gaming leagues are a good example of how this will play out , said mr hawkins .
a surprisingly large number of people who play mobile games sign up for these online leagues , he said .
he describes the ranking systems as " massively single player gaming " because although people play by themselves they can see how they measure up against others .
the potential audience for these small games is huge , says mr hawkins , far bigger than the numbers who play console or pc games .
currently it takes a mid-to-top end phone to play games but , said mr hawkins , within a couple of years the majority of the all world 's 1.5 billion phones will be game-capable .
" it could go from almost zero to 2 billion in five years and there 's never been anything close to that before , " he said .
" this is the dawn of man and nothing has really happened yet . "

the one minute slots , to be shown over the next two weeks , will show biking experiences of families , young professionals and children .
tfl says cycling is growing faster in london than anywhere in the uk and that spring is a good time to get the bikes out of the shed .
on monday , tfl also launched a fund to support community groups , schools and businesses that promote cycling .
rose ades , head of london 's cycling centre of excellence , said : " cycling is a great way to enjoy the parks and get a fresh view of london , particularly now that facilities are improving and there are many more cyclists around .
' perfect time ' " unfortunately , there are lots of bikes around that have not been out for a spin in years .
" spring is the perfect time to get your bike out , explore the city and improve your health . "

from 30 june this year all web shops will have to comply with strict security standards drawn up by the world 's big credit card companies .
online shops will be certified annually and checked quarterly to ensure they maintain the security standards .
websites which flout the rules could be banned from trading or left to soak up the costs of break-ins all by themselves .
locked door the move to tighten up security at online shops happens as increasing numbers of firms report that customer data has been lost or stolen .
in february the bank of america said it had lost more than 1.2 million customer records - though it said there was no evidence that the data had fallen into the hands of criminals .
more recently lexisnexis , choicepoint and hsbc have all revealed that data about customers has been lost to attack by criminal hackers .
it is estimated that this year alone more than 2 million customer records have gone missing or been stolen .
in an attempt to raise the baseline security practices of online merchants and payment processing firms , mastercard , visa , american express , diners , discover , and jcb have drawn up standards that dictate what web shops must do to keep safe .
before these standards were drawn up separate credit card firms and banks had their own different security compliance programs .
" but on data security it became very apparent that this an industry issue that needed to be addressed by the industry as a whole , " said john verdeschi , vice president in mastercard 's vp internet security and e-commerce division .
now all the big credit card firms are aligned behind the payment card industry data security standards that force secure practices on web shops and payment processors .
to comply firms must scan networks four times a year and carry out an annual audit to ensure that the way they work is as safe as the standards demand .
basic steps all web shops that process more than 20,000 transactions per year will have to comply with the pci standards no matter where they are in the world .
this means that tens of thousands of web shops will have to become compliant with the new rules .
the standards go as far as to dictate what length passwords must be , how often they must be changed and force firms to be very careful with credit card information and who gets access to it .
philippe courtot , founder of security firm qualys which will help firms ensure they comply with the standards , said firms that flout the rules face having payment requests refused or bearing the cost of security breaches by themselves .
if large numbers of credit card numbers were stolen or lost , liabilities could run into millions .
" if you do not adopt these rules and do suffer a compromise the cost of that could be excruciating , " said mr verdeschi .
" that 's a pretty good incentive to accomplish this . "
chris dipple , technical director of uk payments processing outfit secpay , said anyone that wants to keep on trading on the net must comply with the standards .
" the banks will not talk to you unless you have these standards , " he said .
mr dipple said there was no doubt that many merchants would have to undergo big changes in the way they worked to comply and prove that they are taking enough care .
" i 'd encourage any major merchant to get on with it even if visa and mastercard are not knocking on their door at the moment , " he said .
