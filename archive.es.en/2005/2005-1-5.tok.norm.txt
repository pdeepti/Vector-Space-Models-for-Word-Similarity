program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2005 germans need a new hannawald großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports have n't come out of the shadow of the past as german athletes fail to capture world titles in key winter sports like the four hills tournament , downhill skiing and nordic events this season , many are beginning to yearn for past glory days . summer was not a good time for german sports enthusiasts .
the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .

26 caused horrific devastation and loss of life .
but , if there 's some consolation to be found , the outpouring of funds and aid around the world to help the victims in the stricken regions has been equally tremendous . even as governments around the world rush to release millions to help the affected countries , individual charitable initiatives and private donations in their countries have n't been far behind . schumacher leads the way in germany , seven-time world formula one champion michael schumacher led the pack of prominent sporting donors to victims of last week 's asian tsunamis , gifting a massive $ 10 million -lrb- € 7.5 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher " the dawning of the new year has not been as joyful for us this year because of the catastrophe in asia , " said schumacher .
" we sympathize with the victims in their grief . " schumacher himself is said to be personally affected by the disaster : his munich-based friend and bodyguard burkhard cramer and his two sons died in the disaster on the popular holiday island of phuket on thailand 's southwestern coast . schumacher 's manager willi weber , who spoke on a tv fundraiser program organized by german broadcaster zdf and mass-selling daily bild zeitung , said schumacher wanted the money to be used for schools and kindergartens in the crisis region . " michael and his wife corinna are shocked and deeply moved by the pictures from asia , " weber told the program called wir wollen helfen -lrb- we want to help -rrb- , which raised more than € 40 million .
it comes a day after another german channel , sat.1 , raised € 10.25 million for the victims of the tidal wave disaster . german , tennis star nicolas kiefer came up with a novel way of fund-raising , saying he would donate $ 100 per ace he served in three australian tournaments . " for every ace , starting now in adelaide , then in sydney , and finally in melbourne , i will donate $ 100 , " he said . " against sjeng schalken , i served five aces , or $ 500 , " for the victims of the tsunamis , kiefer said on his web site . bayern munich for sri lanka germany 's most successful football team , bayern munich , is to finance a rebuilding project in sri lanka , where the number of victims from last week 's tsunamis has risen to over 30,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people walk through debris of their houses destroyed in tidal waves on the coastal areas in colombo , sri lanka bayern has decided " to make € 300,000 available for a project in sri lanka , " president karl-heinz rummenigge said on the club 's internet site on tuesday . " the number of victims , the images of devastation and the suffering of the people have deeply moved us , " he said .
" we want to try to extend a hand to children and people who have suffered and whose future appears so uncertain . " bayern sporting director uli hoeness said the money would be used to build an orphanage or a school . " we will finance this project for the next 15 or 20 years , " he said .
hoeness said he had also decided to donate money he won in a bet with two bayern players that he would not be able to lose 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- in eight weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german football federation and league announced a donation of € 1.5 million .
in addition , the german national 11 will play a friendly match on jan .

the german red cross alone doubled its aid collection within four days to a total of € 22.8 million . the editor of german mass tabloid bild , kai diekmann , said wednesday that the overwhelming readiness of germans to donate " shows what the people in our country stand for . " but , many believe that the drive to donate for the disaster , particularly in the west , is partly heightened because of the involvement in the disaster of so many resorts favored by tourists from rich countries in the west and the richer parts of north-east asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive at frankfurt airport germany alone has counted more than 60 dead nationals caught up in the tragedy while a 1,000 more are still missing in the region .
the total death toll from the disaster edged up towards 146,000 on wednesday . german business : not just making money but , whatever the reason for the generosity , the urge to give has also caught on in german industry circles . german chemical giant basf and pharmaceutical heavyweight bayer have not just shelled out millions to ease the misery and help reconstruction work in south asia , but also taken advantage of the fact that they have a business presence on the affected continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villager returns to a fishermen 's colony in tamil nadu bayer press spokesman günter forneck said his company was able to provide on-the-spot assistance in india , indonesia and thailand . “ we decided to implement the aid campaigns directly in the countries affected through our subsidiaries there , " forneck said .
" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times . " we want to help " deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , who happened to be in india when the disaster struck , said he came back full of " impressions " .
deutsche bank has donated € 10 million . other companies such as deutsche post and the german chapter of the internet auction site , ebay have called on customers to dig up things they have no use for anymore at home .
these are to be packed , labeled with the words " we want to help " and can be sent free of cost to post offices throughout germany . the articles will then be auctioned off on ebay to the highest bidder .
the proceeds will be channeled to a collective deutsche post bank account and then be given to german aid organizations working in the affected tsunami-hit regions . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid germany plans to increase its aid for the tsunami-stricken regions to up to € 500 million , according to reports .

the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .
otherwise it is going to be a long cold winter . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the slippery slope to success maria riesch is well on the way to becoming a skiing icon .

but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .

well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .

the eu executive , which is responsible for monitoring budget discipline in the bloc and has the authority to take disciplinary action against members whose budget deficit exceeds three percent of gross domestic product , said it would treat the millions of euros in aid as “ an exceptional circumstance . ”
the commission ’ s monetary affairs spokeswoman amelia torres said the commission had taken the same position when faced with high spending for flood relief in the eastern part of the germany two years ago .
berlin , which pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- in tsunami aid , has already violated the deficit ceiling three years in a row and is in danger of doing so again .
but the commission doubts the significant contribution will have much effect on the country ’ s budget deficit which is expected to be about 3.9 percent of gdp . dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany the single largest donor so far .

the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2005 germans need a new hannawald großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports have n't come out of the shadow of the past as german athletes fail to capture world titles in key winter sports like the four hills tournament , downhill skiing and nordic events this season , many are beginning to yearn for past glory days . summer was not a good time for german sports enthusiasts .
the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .
otherwise it is going to be a long cold winter . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the slippery slope to success maria riesch is well on the way to becoming a skiing icon .

one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .

the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2005 cuba-eu relations warming up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back on the calling list : castro -lrb- right -rrb- and foreign minister roque for more than a year , ties between brussels and havana were put on ice .
now the castro regime aims to reignite diplomatic relations with the eu – but not with all members . cuba has decided to resume contact with the embassies of germany , france , britain , italy , austria , greece , portugal and sweden .
according to the country ’ s foreign minister , felipe perez roque , havana wants to once again reach out to brussels . but the eu list is far from complete .
fidel castro ’ s government only plans on reviving ties to those eu members who no longer invite dissidents to official embassy affairs in the caribbean island ’ s capital .
among those not included are the netherlands , poland , the czech republic and slovakia . the partial warming up of european relations comes after the eu council on foreign affairs recommended in december that the bloc end diplomatic sanctions .
earlier in the week , roque acknowledged that the change in eu policy had led to havana ’ s decision .
already a month ago cuba reestablished contact to spain , belgium and hungary . end of diplomatic sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havana 's malecon boulevard in 2003 the eu put all relations with cuba on hold after some 75 dissidents were arrested and sentenced to up to 28 years in prison .
castro ’ s government responded in kind by breaking off all ties to european embassies in cuba . since june , however , 14 of the dissidents have been released and brussels has been reconsidering its position . “ both sides have moved back closer to each other because they are both interested in resuming a normalization of relations , ” said bert hoffmann from the institute for ibero-american studies in germany . “ the cubans have made a significant step towards resuming ties by releasing a portion of the dissidents , ” he said and added that the europeans had done their part by refusing to invite dissidents to receptions in their embassies . it ’ s also likely that this “ low profile diplomacy ” will lead to an agreement about releasing all of the dissidents in the near future , hoffman said . eu divides over cuba bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castro has ruled cuba for 51 years not all eu members are happy about resuming relations with havana .
those countries still on castro ’ s black list have resisted a reorientation of eu policy on cuba .
as a result , contact between the cuban government and the embassies of the netherlands and the three new member states is still frozen . “ the eu needs to be careful that the issue of cuba does not divide the bloc , ” hoffman said .
“ due to their -lrb- communist -rrb- past , poland , the czech republic and slovakia understandably have a different relationship to cuba as compared to spain , for example . ” havana recognizes this and as a result tries to conduct as much business bilaterally as possible and avoids dealing with the eu as a whole . hoffmann predicted that it will not come to a big rift in the eu over cuba – unlike two years ago with the war in iraq .
but he is nonetheless doubtful that the eu will be able to speak with one voice regarding cuba .
interests in the 25-member bloc are still too diverse , he said .
while people in madrid think first of the economy in cuba , those in prague are primarily considered with human rights issues . michael knigge -lrb- ktz -rrb- , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu ship sails into a caribbean storm in just over a month , the once calm relations between the european union and cuba have grown stormy .

now the castro regime aims to reignite diplomatic relations with the eu – but not with all members . cuba has decided to resume contact with the embassies of germany , france , britain , italy , austria , greece , portugal and sweden .
according to the country ’ s foreign minister , felipe perez roque , havana wants to once again reach out to brussels . but the eu list is far from complete .
fidel castro ’ s government only plans on reviving ties to those eu members who no longer invite dissidents to official embassy affairs in the caribbean island ’ s capital .
among those not included are the netherlands , poland , the czech republic and slovakia . the partial warming up of european relations comes after the eu council on foreign affairs recommended in december that the bloc end diplomatic sanctions .
earlier in the week , roque acknowledged that the change in eu policy had led to havana ’ s decision .

those countries still on castro ’ s black list have resisted a reorientation of eu policy on cuba .
as a result , contact between the cuban government and the embassies of the netherlands and the three new member states is still frozen . “ the eu needs to be careful that the issue of cuba does not divide the bloc , ” hoffman said .
“ due to their -lrb- communist -rrb- past , poland , the czech republic and slovakia understandably have a different relationship to cuba as compared to spain , for example . ” havana recognizes this and as a result tries to conduct as much business bilaterally as possible and avoids dealing with the eu as a whole . hoffmann predicted that it will not come to a big rift in the eu over cuba – unlike two years ago with the war in iraq .
but he is nonetheless doubtful that the eu will be able to speak with one voice regarding cuba .

but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .

" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .

" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .

the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .

tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .

well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

the break-down of communication networks in the worst-hit regions of aceh have cut off entire towns from the outside world , posing a further strain on traumatized flood victims . with no way of informing themselves about the catastrophe , many survivors are unaware of the staggering dimensions of the disaster they 're caught in .
most have no idea what kind of relief measures are underway and who they can turn to in their anguish .
in addition , the survivors have no information on how they can protect themselves from illness and epidemics . taking stock it 's against this turbulent background that dw wants to participate in reconstructing the battered rebroadcasting radio stations in aceh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia .
one of dw 's partner stations from jakarta has already sent a fact-finding team to aceh to investigate what is needed to set up at least one or two radio stations and have them up and running as soon as possible .

well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .

psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .

the eu executive , which is responsible for monitoring budget discipline in the bloc and has the authority to take disciplinary action against members whose budget deficit exceeds three percent of gross domestic product , said it would treat the millions of euros in aid as “ an exceptional circumstance . ”

berlin , which pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- in tsunami aid , has already violated the deficit ceiling three years in a row and is in danger of doing so again .
but the commission doubts the significant contribution will have much effect on the country ’ s budget deficit which is expected to be about 3.9 percent of gdp . dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany the single largest donor so far .

the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .

26 caused horrific devastation and loss of life .
but , if there 's some consolation to be found , the outpouring of funds and aid around the world to help the victims in the stricken regions has been equally tremendous . even as governments around the world rush to release millions to help the affected countries , individual charitable initiatives and private donations in their countries have n't been far behind . schumacher leads the way in germany , seven-time world formula one champion michael schumacher led the pack of prominent sporting donors to victims of last week 's asian tsunamis , gifting a massive $ 10 million -lrb- € 7.5 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher " the dawning of the new year has not been as joyful for us this year because of the catastrophe in asia , " said schumacher .
" we sympathize with the victims in their grief . " schumacher himself is said to be personally affected by the disaster : his munich-based friend and bodyguard burkhard cramer and his two sons died in the disaster on the popular holiday island of phuket on thailand 's southwestern coast . schumacher 's manager willi weber , who spoke on a tv fundraiser program organized by german broadcaster zdf and mass-selling daily bild zeitung , said schumacher wanted the money to be used for schools and kindergartens in the crisis region . " michael and his wife corinna are shocked and deeply moved by the pictures from asia , " weber told the program called wir wollen helfen -lrb- we want to help -rrb- , which raised more than € 40 million .
it comes a day after another german channel , sat.1 , raised € 10.25 million for the victims of the tidal wave disaster . german , tennis star nicolas kiefer came up with a novel way of fund-raising , saying he would donate $ 100 per ace he served in three australian tournaments . " for every ace , starting now in adelaide , then in sydney , and finally in melbourne , i will donate $ 100 , " he said . " against sjeng schalken , i served five aces , or $ 500 , " for the victims of the tsunamis , kiefer said on his web site . bayern munich for sri lanka germany 's most successful football team , bayern munich , is to finance a rebuilding project in sri lanka , where the number of victims from last week 's tsunamis has risen to over 30,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people walk through debris of their houses destroyed in tidal waves on the coastal areas in colombo , sri lanka bayern has decided " to make € 300,000 available for a project in sri lanka , " president karl-heinz rummenigge said on the club 's internet site on tuesday . " the number of victims , the images of devastation and the suffering of the people have deeply moved us , " he said .
" we want to try to extend a hand to children and people who have suffered and whose future appears so uncertain . " bayern sporting director uli hoeness said the money would be used to build an orphanage or a school . " we will finance this project for the next 15 or 20 years , " he said .
hoeness said he had also decided to donate money he won in a bet with two bayern players that he would not be able to lose 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- in eight weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german football federation and league announced a donation of € 1.5 million .
in addition , the german national 11 will play a friendly match on jan .
25 against a bundesliga select side , with proceeds also going to victims of the catastrophe . personal tragedy there remains little doubt that germans are prepared to dig deep into their pockets to help the victims of the tsunami disaster . an afp survey showed on tuesday that private donations amounted for nearly € 110 million of the funds collected by big aid organizations in the country .
the german red cross alone doubled its aid collection within four days to a total of € 22.8 million . the editor of german mass tabloid bild , kai diekmann , said wednesday that the overwhelming readiness of germans to donate " shows what the people in our country stand for . " but , many believe that the drive to donate for the disaster , particularly in the west , is partly heightened because of the involvement in the disaster of so many resorts favored by tourists from rich countries in the west and the richer parts of north-east asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive at frankfurt airport germany alone has counted more than 60 dead nationals caught up in the tragedy while a 1,000 more are still missing in the region .
the total death toll from the disaster edged up towards 146,000 on wednesday . german business : not just making money but , whatever the reason for the generosity , the urge to give has also caught on in german industry circles . german chemical giant basf and pharmaceutical heavyweight bayer have not just shelled out millions to ease the misery and help reconstruction work in south asia , but also taken advantage of the fact that they have a business presence on the affected continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villager returns to a fishermen 's colony in tamil nadu bayer press spokesman günter forneck said his company was able to provide on-the-spot assistance in india , indonesia and thailand . “ we decided to implement the aid campaigns directly in the countries affected through our subsidiaries there , " forneck said .
" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times . " we want to help " deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , who happened to be in india when the disaster struck , said he came back full of " impressions " .
deutsche bank has donated € 10 million . other companies such as deutsche post and the german chapter of the internet auction site , ebay have called on customers to dig up things they have no use for anymore at home .
these are to be packed , labeled with the words " we want to help " and can be sent free of cost to post offices throughout germany . the articles will then be auctioned off on ebay to the highest bidder .
the proceeds will be channeled to a collective deutsche post bank account and then be given to german aid organizations working in the affected tsunami-hit regions . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid germany plans to increase its aid for the tsunami-stricken regions to up to € 500 million , according to reports .

26 caused horrific devastation and loss of life .
but , if there 's some consolation to be found , the outpouring of funds and aid around the world to help the victims in the stricken regions has been equally tremendous . even as governments around the world rush to release millions to help the affected countries , individual charitable initiatives and private donations in their countries have n't been far behind . schumacher leads the way in germany , seven-time world formula one champion michael schumacher led the pack of prominent sporting donors to victims of last week 's asian tsunamis , gifting a massive $ 10 million -lrb- € 7.5 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher " the dawning of the new year has not been as joyful for us this year because of the catastrophe in asia , " said schumacher .
" we sympathize with the victims in their grief .

" michael and his wife corinna are shocked and deeply moved by the pictures from asia , " weber told the program called wir wollen helfen -lrb- we want to help -rrb- , which raised more than € 40 million .
it comes a day after another german channel , sat.1 , raised € 10.25 million for the victims of the tidal wave disaster . german , tennis star nicolas kiefer came up with a novel way of fund-raising , saying he would donate $ 100 per ace he served in three australian tournaments . " for every ace , starting now in adelaide , then in sydney , and finally in melbourne , i will donate $ 100 , " he said . " against sjeng schalken , i served five aces , or $ 500 , " for the victims of the tsunamis , kiefer said on his web site . bayern munich for sri lanka germany 's most successful football team , bayern munich , is to finance a rebuilding project in sri lanka , where the number of victims from last week 's tsunamis has risen to over 30,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people walk through debris of their houses destroyed in tidal waves on the coastal areas in colombo , sri lanka bayern has decided " to make € 300,000 available for a project in sri lanka , " president karl-heinz rummenigge said on the club 's internet site on tuesday . " the number of victims , the images of devastation and the suffering of the people have deeply moved us , " he said .

" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times .

deutsche bank has donated € 10 million . other companies such as deutsche post and the german chapter of the internet auction site , ebay have called on customers to dig up things they have no use for anymore at home .
these are to be packed , labeled with the words " we want to help " and can be sent free of cost to post offices throughout germany . the articles will then be auctioned off on ebay to the highest bidder .

the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .

the eu executive , which is responsible for monitoring budget discipline in the bloc and has the authority to take disciplinary action against members whose budget deficit exceeds three percent of gross domestic product , said it would treat the millions of euros in aid as “ an exceptional circumstance . ”
the commission ’ s monetary affairs spokeswoman amelia torres said the commission had taken the same position when faced with high spending for flood relief in the eastern part of the germany two years ago .
berlin , which pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- in tsunami aid , has already violated the deficit ceiling three years in a row and is in danger of doing so again .
but the commission doubts the significant contribution will have much effect on the country ’ s budget deficit which is expected to be about 3.9 percent of gdp . dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany the single largest donor so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2005 germans need a new hannawald großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports have n't come out of the shadow of the past as german athletes fail to capture world titles in key winter sports like the four hills tournament , downhill skiing and nordic events this season , many are beginning to yearn for past glory days . summer was not a good time for german sports enthusiasts .
the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .

and there 's been no sign of life from most of them ever since the disaster struck , giving rise to fears that they could have been destroyed in the tidal waves . vital information missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acehnese people walk past a destroyed market building in banda aceh aceh in northern sumatra , which was closest to the epicenter of the underwater quake which triggered a tsunami in the indian ocean on dec .

media reports of chaotic scenes and untold destruction on the island province have been unfolding over the past few days .
entire streets and towns have been erased from the map . some of the televised images show collapsed transmitting aerials on the beach .
the break-down of communication networks in the worst-hit regions of aceh have cut off entire towns from the outside world , posing a further strain on traumatized flood victims . with no way of informing themselves about the catastrophe , many survivors are unaware of the staggering dimensions of the disaster they 're caught in .
most have no idea what kind of relief measures are underway and who they can turn to in their anguish .
in addition , the survivors have no information on how they can protect themselves from illness and epidemics . taking stock it 's against this turbulent background that dw wants to participate in reconstructing the battered rebroadcasting radio stations in aceh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia .
one of dw 's partner stations from jakarta has already sent a fact-finding team to aceh to investigate what is needed to set up at least one or two radio stations and have them up and running as soon as possible .
a dw journalist from the indonesian team has also left for the region to get a clearer picture of the situation on the ground . at the same time , dw is collecting simple battery-operated radios and is planning to dispatch them as quickly as possible along with other relief supplies to the crisis region so that survivors of the tragedy can at least stay in contact with the rest of the world . sybille golte -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .

but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .

but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

and there 's been no sign of life from most of them ever since the disaster struck , giving rise to fears that they could have been destroyed in the tidal waves . vital information missing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acehnese people walk past a destroyed market building in banda aceh aceh in northern sumatra , which was closest to the epicenter of the underwater quake which triggered a tsunami in the indian ocean on dec .

media reports of chaotic scenes and untold destruction on the island province have been unfolding over the past few days .
entire streets and towns have been erased from the map . some of the televised images show collapsed transmitting aerials on the beach .
the break-down of communication networks in the worst-hit regions of aceh have cut off entire towns from the outside world , posing a further strain on traumatized flood victims . with no way of informing themselves about the catastrophe , many survivors are unaware of the staggering dimensions of the disaster they 're caught in .
most have no idea what kind of relief measures are underway and who they can turn to in their anguish .
in addition , the survivors have no information on how they can protect themselves from illness and epidemics . taking stock it 's against this turbulent background that dw wants to participate in reconstructing the battered rebroadcasting radio stations in aceh . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless acehnese people wait aboard a ship in the port of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia .
one of dw 's partner stations from jakarta has already sent a fact-finding team to aceh to investigate what is needed to set up at least one or two radio stations and have them up and running as soon as possible .

angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .
26 .
germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- . " not credit , but money " addressing a press conference in berlin on wednesday after a special cabinet meeting , chancellor schröder said that the funds would be released within a time frame of not less than three years and not more than five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man carries his bicycle through the rubble in the devastated shopping district of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia " this period is linked to the capacity to absorb " the aid in the region , where tidal waves lashed almost a dozen countries killing around 150,000 people , the chancellor said . he stressed the importance of providing unbureacratic and speedy aid to the devastated regions . but schröder was reluctant to provide details about what form the massive package earmarked by germany would take . he did suggest that it could include debt reduction and measures taken with members of the european union and the group of seven major powers .
" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale . " the whole german nation stands in solidarity with the countries of the region , " he said . " this help will continue , " he added , listing work carried out by the military and the army of volunteers who have been helping in germany and the affected regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the tsunami disaster arrive at frankfurt airport with 60 germans already confirmed dead and more than 1,000 missing in the massive sea surges , the disaster has struck a chord with the public here and individual donations totalling around € 170 million have been made . speaking at the same press conference , foreign minister joschka fischer said he hoped to leave late on friday for thailand , sri lanka and indonesia and to report back to the german government next wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 05.01.2005 germans need a new hannawald großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports have n't come out of the shadow of the past as german athletes fail to capture world titles in key winter sports like the four hills tournament , downhill skiing and nordic events this season , many are beginning to yearn for past glory days . summer was not a good time for german sports enthusiasts .
the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .
with the exception of rowing events , where germany undisputedly dominated the waters , few athletes brought home the much-expected wins .
in soccer the ball-crazed country performed even worse , burning out in the qualification rounds of the european championship in portugal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold was a very precious and rare medal for germany at the athens olympics with the frustrations of the warmer months still etched on their memory , germans began to look forward to the winter sports .
after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .
otherwise it is going to be a long cold winter . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de on the slippery slope to success maria riesch is well on the way to becoming a skiing icon .

“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .

in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .

with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .

26 caused horrific devastation and loss of life .
but , if there 's some consolation to be found , the outpouring of funds and aid around the world to help the victims in the stricken regions has been equally tremendous . even as governments around the world rush to release millions to help the affected countries , individual charitable initiatives and private donations in their countries have n't been far behind . schumacher leads the way in germany , seven-time world formula one champion michael schumacher led the pack of prominent sporting donors to victims of last week 's asian tsunamis , gifting a massive $ 10 million -lrb- € 7.5 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher " the dawning of the new year has not been as joyful for us this year because of the catastrophe in asia , " said schumacher .
" we sympathize with the victims in their grief . " schumacher himself is said to be personally affected by the disaster : his munich-based friend and bodyguard burkhard cramer and his two sons died in the disaster on the popular holiday island of phuket on thailand 's southwestern coast . schumacher 's manager willi weber , who spoke on a tv fundraiser program organized by german broadcaster zdf and mass-selling daily bild zeitung , said schumacher wanted the money to be used for schools and kindergartens in the crisis region . " michael and his wife corinna are shocked and deeply moved by the pictures from asia , " weber told the program called wir wollen helfen -lrb- we want to help -rrb- , which raised more than € 40 million .
it comes a day after another german channel , sat.1 , raised € 10.25 million for the victims of the tidal wave disaster . german , tennis star nicolas kiefer came up with a novel way of fund-raising , saying he would donate $ 100 per ace he served in three australian tournaments . " for every ace , starting now in adelaide , then in sydney , and finally in melbourne , i will donate $ 100 , " he said . " against sjeng schalken , i served five aces , or $ 500 , " for the victims of the tsunamis , kiefer said on his web site . bayern munich for sri lanka germany 's most successful football team , bayern munich , is to finance a rebuilding project in sri lanka , where the number of victims from last week 's tsunamis has risen to over 30,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people walk through debris of their houses destroyed in tidal waves on the coastal areas in colombo , sri lanka bayern has decided " to make € 300,000 available for a project in sri lanka , " president karl-heinz rummenigge said on the club 's internet site on tuesday . " the number of victims , the images of devastation and the suffering of the people have deeply moved us , " he said .
" we want to try to extend a hand to children and people who have suffered and whose future appears so uncertain . " bayern sporting director uli hoeness said the money would be used to build an orphanage or a school . " we will finance this project for the next 15 or 20 years , " he said .
hoeness said he had also decided to donate money he won in a bet with two bayern players that he would not be able to lose 16 kilos -lrb- 35 pounds -rrb- in eight weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german football federation and league announced a donation of € 1.5 million .

the german red cross alone doubled its aid collection within four days to a total of € 22.8 million . the editor of german mass tabloid bild , kai diekmann , said wednesday that the overwhelming readiness of germans to donate " shows what the people in our country stand for . " but , many believe that the drive to donate for the disaster , particularly in the west , is partly heightened because of the involvement in the disaster of so many resorts favored by tourists from rich countries in the west and the richer parts of north-east asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive at frankfurt airport germany alone has counted more than 60 dead nationals caught up in the tragedy while a 1,000 more are still missing in the region .

" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times . " we want to help " deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , who happened to be in india when the disaster struck , said he came back full of " impressions " .
deutsche bank has donated € 10 million . other companies such as deutsche post and the german chapter of the internet auction site , ebay have called on customers to dig up things they have no use for anymore at home .
these are to be packed , labeled with the words " we want to help " and can be sent free of cost to post offices throughout germany . the articles will then be auctioned off on ebay to the highest bidder .
the proceeds will be channeled to a collective deutsche post bank account and then be given to german aid organizations working in the affected tsunami-hit regions . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid germany plans to increase its aid for the tsunami-stricken regions to up to € 500 million , according to reports .

germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- .

" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale . " the whole german nation stands in solidarity with the countries of the region , " he said . " this help will continue , " he added , listing work carried out by the military and the army of volunteers who have been helping in germany and the affected regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the tsunami disaster arrive at frankfurt airport with 60 germans already confirmed dead and more than 1,000 missing in the massive sea surges , the disaster has struck a chord with the public here and individual donations totalling around € 170 million have been made . speaking at the same press conference , foreign minister joschka fischer said he hoped to leave late on friday for thailand , sri lanka and indonesia and to report back to the german government next wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

26 caused horrific devastation and loss of life .
but , if there 's some consolation to be found , the outpouring of funds and aid around the world to help the victims in the stricken regions has been equally tremendous . even as governments around the world rush to release millions to help the affected countries , individual charitable initiatives and private donations in their countries have n't been far behind . schumacher leads the way in germany , seven-time world formula one champion michael schumacher led the pack of prominent sporting donors to victims of last week 's asian tsunamis , gifting a massive $ 10 million -lrb- € 7.5 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher " the dawning of the new year has not been as joyful for us this year because of the catastrophe in asia , " said schumacher .
" we sympathize with the victims in their grief . " schumacher himself is said to be personally affected by the disaster : his munich-based friend and bodyguard burkhard cramer and his two sons died in the disaster on the popular holiday island of phuket on thailand 's southwestern coast . schumacher 's manager willi weber , who spoke on a tv fundraiser program organized by german broadcaster zdf and mass-selling daily bild zeitung , said schumacher wanted the money to be used for schools and kindergartens in the crisis region . " michael and his wife corinna are shocked and deeply moved by the pictures from asia , " weber told the program called wir wollen helfen -lrb- we want to help -rrb- , which raised more than € 40 million .
it comes a day after another german channel , sat.1 , raised € 10.25 million for the victims of the tidal wave disaster . german , tennis star nicolas kiefer came up with a novel way of fund-raising , saying he would donate $ 100 per ace he served in three australian tournaments . " for every ace , starting now in adelaide , then in sydney , and finally in melbourne , i will donate $ 100 , " he said . " against sjeng schalken , i served five aces , or $ 500 , " for the victims of the tsunamis , kiefer said on his web site . bayern munich for sri lanka germany 's most successful football team , bayern munich , is to finance a rebuilding project in sri lanka , where the number of victims from last week 's tsunamis has risen to over 30,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people walk through debris of their houses destroyed in tidal waves on the coastal areas in colombo , sri lanka bayern has decided " to make € 300,000 available for a project in sri lanka , " president karl-heinz rummenigge said on the club 's internet site on tuesday . " the number of victims , the images of devastation and the suffering of the people have deeply moved us , " he said .
" we want to try to extend a hand to children and people who have suffered and whose future appears so uncertain . " bayern sporting director uli hoeness said the money would be used to build an orphanage or a school . " we will finance this project for the next 15 or 20 years , " he said .

the german red cross alone doubled its aid collection within four days to a total of € 22.8 million . the editor of german mass tabloid bild , kai diekmann , said wednesday that the overwhelming readiness of germans to donate " shows what the people in our country stand for . " but , many believe that the drive to donate for the disaster , particularly in the west , is partly heightened because of the involvement in the disaster of so many resorts favored by tourists from rich countries in the west and the richer parts of north-east asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive at frankfurt airport germany alone has counted more than 60 dead nationals caught up in the tragedy while a 1,000 more are still missing in the region .
the total death toll from the disaster edged up towards 146,000 on wednesday . german business : not just making money but , whatever the reason for the generosity , the urge to give has also caught on in german industry circles . german chemical giant basf and pharmaceutical heavyweight bayer have not just shelled out millions to ease the misery and help reconstruction work in south asia , but also taken advantage of the fact that they have a business presence on the affected continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villager returns to a fishermen 's colony in tamil nadu bayer press spokesman günter forneck said his company was able to provide on-the-spot assistance in india , indonesia and thailand . “ we decided to implement the aid campaigns directly in the countries affected through our subsidiaries there , " forneck said .
" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times . " we want to help " deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , who happened to be in india when the disaster struck , said he came back full of " impressions " .

angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .

germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- .

" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

the olympics turned out to be a major disappointment for the country ’ s medal aspirations .

after all , historically , these were the events where the country triumphed .
one only needs to recall the 2002 salt lake city olympics , when germany topped the list of nations with a record 35 medals , 12 of which were gold . and who can forget ski jumping sensation sven hannawald , who flew to a historic quadruple victory in the 2001/02 four hills tournament and set the stage for a series of wins in the event ? burn and bust ? those glory days may be long gone .
hannawald , who suffered a burn-out syndrome after failing to bring home any significant victories last year , has completely removed himself from competition .
the once immensely popular sport in which germany has not fallen under sixth place since 1994 is now facing hard times .
this year ’ s ski jumping grand slam will produce the country ’ s worst showing in 10 years . although two-time world title holder martin schmitt managed to jump to seventh place during this week ’ s innsbruck competition of the four hills tournament , the german team has little hope of turning around what has started out as a disappointing season .
this year ’ s star has already been crowned : janne ahonen from finland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald soars in front of the zugspitze during the second competition of the four hills tournament on jan .
1 , 2002 .
“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .
in the women ’ s competition , marlies schild has emerged as the face to watch after she captured the world cup in both the slalom and giant slalom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's hilde gerg speeds through a super-g course hilde gerg , the 1998 gold medallist from nagano , is so far the only german woman to bring home a major win in the alpine events this year with a victory at st. moritz in the super-g .
in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .
norway has its sights clearly trained on world titles in both men ’ s and women ’ s biathlon , disciplines germany had mastered only recently with several gold medals and world cup victories under its belt . with the exception of third-places for axel teichmann and claudia künzel in the 30-kilometer long-distance events , germans had little to celebrate in cross-country skiing .
the women ’ s relay team had to be content with a fifth place finish at the world cup in asiago , italy , while the men watched from the sidelines after failing to qualify for the finals . world champions in luge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara niedernhuber , silver medalist -lrb- left -rrb- , sylke otto , gold , and silke kraushaar , bronze , celebrate germany 's sweep in the women 's singles luge at the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics the only winter discipline still unquestionably in the hands of germans is the luge .
with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .
it ’ s also unlikely that an event that only draws a few thousand spectators can reverse the overall pessimism that has plagued the german sports scene . what is needed is a new hannawald to send german sports enthusiasts soaring .

the eu executive , which is responsible for monitoring budget discipline in the bloc and has the authority to take disciplinary action against members whose budget deficit exceeds three percent of gross domestic product , said it would treat the millions of euros in aid as “ an exceptional circumstance . ”
the commission ’ s monetary affairs spokeswoman amelia torres said the commission had taken the same position when faced with high spending for flood relief in the eastern part of the germany two years ago .
berlin , which pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- in tsunami aid , has already violated the deficit ceiling three years in a row and is in danger of doing so again .
but the commission doubts the significant contribution will have much effect on the country ’ s budget deficit which is expected to be about 3.9 percent of gdp . dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany the single largest donor so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 05.01.2005 germany promises € 500 million in aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision was announced after a meeting of the german cabinet german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany one of the single largest donors so far . german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed on wednesday that berlin would contribute € 500 million in aid to the tsunami-ravaged indian ocean region . this tops the € 20 million the governing coalition of social democrats and greens had already promised for humanitarian aid in south asia .
angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .

germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- . " not credit , but money " addressing a press conference in berlin on wednesday after a special cabinet meeting , chancellor schröder said that the funds would be released within a time frame of not less than three years and not more than five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man carries his bicycle through the rubble in the devastated shopping district of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia " this period is linked to the capacity to absorb " the aid in the region , where tidal waves lashed almost a dozen countries killing around 150,000 people , the chancellor said . he stressed the importance of providing unbureacratic and speedy aid to the devastated regions . but schröder was reluctant to provide details about what form the massive package earmarked by germany would take . he did suggest that it could include debt reduction and measures taken with members of the european union and the group of seven major powers .
" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale . " the whole german nation stands in solidarity with the countries of the region , " he said . " this help will continue , " he added , listing work carried out by the military and the army of volunteers who have been helping in germany and the affected regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the tsunami disaster arrive at frankfurt airport with 60 germans already confirmed dead and more than 1,000 missing in the massive sea surges , the disaster has struck a chord with the public here and individual donations totalling around € 170 million have been made . speaking at the same press conference , foreign minister joschka fischer said he hoped to leave late on friday for thailand , sri lanka and indonesia and to report back to the german government next wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .

germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- . " not credit , but money " addressing a press conference in berlin on wednesday after a special cabinet meeting , chancellor schröder said that the funds would be released within a time frame of not less than three years and not more than five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man carries his bicycle through the rubble in the devastated shopping district of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia " this period is linked to the capacity to absorb " the aid in the region , where tidal waves lashed almost a dozen countries killing around 150,000 people , the chancellor said . he stressed the importance of providing unbureacratic and speedy aid to the devastated regions . but schröder was reluctant to provide details about what form the massive package earmarked by germany would take . he did suggest that it could include debt reduction and measures taken with members of the european union and the group of seven major powers .
" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale . " the whole german nation stands in solidarity with the countries of the region , " he said . " this help will continue , " he added , listing work carried out by the military and the army of volunteers who have been helping in germany and the affected regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the tsunami disaster arrive at frankfurt airport with 60 germans already confirmed dead and more than 1,000 missing in the massive sea surges , the disaster has struck a chord with the public here and individual donations totalling around € 170 million have been made . speaking at the same press conference , foreign minister joschka fischer said he hoped to leave late on friday for thailand , sri lanka and indonesia and to report back to the german government next wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

26 caused horrific devastation and loss of life .
but , if there 's some consolation to be found , the outpouring of funds and aid around the world to help the victims in the stricken regions has been equally tremendous . even as governments around the world rush to release millions to help the affected countries , individual charitable initiatives and private donations in their countries have n't been far behind . schumacher leads the way in germany , seven-time world formula one champion michael schumacher led the pack of prominent sporting donors to victims of last week 's asian tsunamis , gifting a massive $ 10 million -lrb- € 7.5 million -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher " the dawning of the new year has not been as joyful for us this year because of the catastrophe in asia , " said schumacher .

" michael and his wife corinna are shocked and deeply moved by the pictures from asia , " weber told the program called wir wollen helfen -lrb- we want to help -rrb- , which raised more than € 40 million .
it comes a day after another german channel , sat.1 , raised € 10.25 million for the victims of the tidal wave disaster . german , tennis star nicolas kiefer came up with a novel way of fund-raising , saying he would donate $ 100 per ace he served in three australian tournaments .

the german red cross alone doubled its aid collection within four days to a total of € 22.8 million . the editor of german mass tabloid bild , kai diekmann , said wednesday that the overwhelming readiness of germans to donate " shows what the people in our country stand for . " but , many believe that the drive to donate for the disaster , particularly in the west , is partly heightened because of the involvement in the disaster of so many resorts favored by tourists from rich countries in the west and the richer parts of north-east asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors arrive at frankfurt airport germany alone has counted more than 60 dead nationals caught up in the tragedy while a 1,000 more are still missing in the region .

" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

a dw journalist from the indonesian team has also left for the region to get a clearer picture of the situation on the ground . at the same time , dw is collecting simple battery-operated radios and is planning to dispatch them as quickly as possible along with other relief supplies to the crisis region so that survivors of the tragedy can at least stay in contact with the rest of the world . sybille golte -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .

" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .

" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .

" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : waves of horror dw-hotline for missing persons schröder seeks debt relief , partnerships tsunami disaster brings generosity could a warning have saved lives ? germany -pipe- 05.01.2005 germany promises € 500 million in aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision was announced after a meeting of the german cabinet german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany one of the single largest donors so far . german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed on wednesday that berlin would contribute € 500 million in aid to the tsunami-ravaged indian ocean region . this tops the € 20 million the governing coalition of social democrats and greens had already promised for humanitarian aid in south asia .
angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .
26 .
germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- . " not credit , but money " addressing a press conference in berlin on wednesday after a special cabinet meeting , chancellor schröder said that the funds would be released within a time frame of not less than three years and not more than five . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an acehnese man carries his bicycle through the rubble in the devastated shopping district of banda aceh , sumatra , indonesia " this period is linked to the capacity to absorb " the aid in the region , where tidal waves lashed almost a dozen countries killing around 150,000 people , the chancellor said . he stressed the importance of providing unbureacratic and speedy aid to the devastated regions . but schröder was reluctant to provide details about what form the massive package earmarked by germany would take . he did suggest that it could include debt reduction and measures taken with members of the european union and the group of seven major powers .
" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale . " the whole german nation stands in solidarity with the countries of the region , " he said . " this help will continue , " he added , listing work carried out by the military and the army of volunteers who have been helping in germany and the affected regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the tsunami disaster arrive at frankfurt airport with 60 germans already confirmed dead and more than 1,000 missing in the massive sea surges , the disaster has struck a chord with the public here and individual donations totalling around € 170 million have been made . speaking at the same press conference , foreign minister joschka fischer said he hoped to leave late on friday for thailand , sri lanka and indonesia and to report back to the german government next wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .

germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- .

" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale . " the whole german nation stands in solidarity with the countries of the region , " he said . " this help will continue , " he added , listing work carried out by the military and the army of volunteers who have been helping in germany and the affected regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german survivors of the tsunami disaster arrive at frankfurt airport with 60 germans already confirmed dead and more than 1,000 missing in the massive sea surges , the disaster has struck a chord with the public here and individual donations totalling around € 170 million have been made . speaking at the same press conference , foreign minister joschka fischer said he hoped to leave late on friday for thailand , sri lanka and indonesia and to report back to the german government next wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german army gears up for " mission aceh " germany has increased aid to indonesia , the worst-hit country in the tsunami disaster , by sending in the army to set up a high-tech mobile field hospital in the ravaged aceh province .

" against sjeng schalken , i served five aces , or $ 500 , " for the victims of the tsunamis , kiefer said on his web site . bayern munich for sri lanka germany 's most successful football team , bayern munich , is to finance a rebuilding project in sri lanka , where the number of victims from last week 's tsunamis has risen to over 30,000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people walk through debris of their houses destroyed in tidal waves on the coastal areas in colombo , sri lanka bayern has decided " to make € 300,000 available for a project in sri lanka , " president karl-heinz rummenigge said on the club 's internet site on tuesday .

" we can judge much better , faster and more effectively on the spot what needs to be done and when and how . we also provided technical assistance , medicines and relief workers . ” the director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , martin wansleben , said that german firms are not only in places where there is money to be made , but can also show generosity in difficult times .

deutsche bank has donated € 10 million . other companies such as deutsche post and the german chapter of the internet auction site , ebay have called on customers to dig up things they have no use for anymore at home .
these are to be packed , labeled with the words " we want to help " and can be sent free of cost to post offices throughout germany . the articles will then be auctioned off on ebay to the highest bidder .

“ we need a new hannawald , ” the president of the four hills tournament , dietmar hemerka , told german sports information service on monday .
without a new national sports sensation the likes of hanni , as he ’ s affectionately called , the sport is likely to go the same way as many of the summer disciplines . first , the fans will stop coming to the events - many of which are held in germany - then sponsors will start losing interest and , in the end , there will be no incoming talent for the next generation , hemerka lamented . alpine and nordic events go north and south in other sports , this season ’ s first international competitions haven ’ t produced many more stunning moments .
the alpine events , which took place during the last two weeks , have been dominated by germany ’ s southern neighbors , particularly the austrians .

in the men ’ s alpine competitions , the germans couldn ’ t even break through the top 10 , coming in at best a modest 15th in the downhill event . germany hasn ’ t fared much better in the nordic events , which are the clear domain of the scandinavians this year .

with a one-two-three sweep by barbara niedernhuber , sylke otto and silke kraushaar in singles and a first place in the doubles this past weekend in königssee , german women once again showed they are the champions in the often marginalized sport . since 1997 , the country has not produced anything under a third-place finish in any of the luge events .
in the team competition , german men and women topped the list on new year ’ s day in oberhof , ahead of italy and austria . but the victories in luge , a sport which relies equally on athletic skills and finely-engineered sleds , will not likely dominate the sporting headlines this winter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.01.2005 tourism after the flood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on thailand 's patong beach , tourism goes on thailand , sri lanka and the maldives are among the most popular holiday destinations for germans .
but after the devastation wrought on these and other asian resorts by the tsunamis , will germans still go there in droves ? when the first post-tsunami photos of german tourists relaxing on thai beaches emerged , they prompted a general feeling of shock and indignation .
how can they swim and sunbathe as if nothing happened , while on other beaches , rescue workers are still searching for the bodies of those killed by the giant waves ?
the german mass-circulation daily bild brought the matter to a point when it asked : " is it still morally acceptable to vacation in thailand or other affected countries ? "
for the president of the german travel operators ' federation , the answer is : " yes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerners taking a sunbath at patong beach , phuket province , thailand on saturday " aside from the help that 's coming from all over the world for reconstruction in the affected areas , the best form of support is for tourists to start traveling in those countries again as soon as possible , " said klaus laepple .
" these countries should not be punished a second time through a travel boycott , because many of the locals are , to a large extent , dependent on tourism .
a person who works in one of the big hotels , for example , can feed their entire family . "
psychological barrier while the top priority in the affected regions remains humanitarian aid , the federal association of the german tourism industry -lrb- btw -rrb- said that this week damage assessment is being carried out in the main tourism areas to decide which hotels need to be torn down and which ones only need to be renovated before they can re-open .
in the maldives , for example , 70 percent of hotels are reported to be in good condition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandolhudhoo island , maldives , on sunday : many resorts on the islands suffered only light damage .
" trips to the maldives have been going ahead as planned since jan .
1 , " said volker böttcher , spokesman for german tour operator tui .
" however , we 've put all our packages to sri lanka , phuket , and khao lak in thailand on hold until the end of january , and once that time comes , we 'll reassess the situation and decide what to do . "
tui customers booked on holidays to the affected region can choose to have a refund , or be re-routed to an alternative destination .
between 70 and 80 percent of customers are choosing the latter , the company said .
among the places they can now travel to are mexico , the caribbean , the canary islands - and thailand .
well-known destinations on thailand 's east coast and along the gulf of thailand - resorts such as koh samui , hua hin , and pattaya - were untouched by the tsunamis , though some experts say european tourists would likely have to overcome a sizeable psychological barrier to go there .
repeated media images of unsuspecting tourists being engulfed by a rush of water , devastated luxury resorts , and rescue workers involved in the grim task of finding and burying the dead have left their impact .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patong beach in phuket the day that disaster struck : such scenes were limited to the country 's west coast .
" anyone in germany who 's been following the news reports about the catastrophe and who maybe does n't have a good idea of thailand 's geography has , unfortunately , been left with the impression that the whole country is a wasteland , " said one berlin-based travel agent specializing in asian destinations .
short memories still , experts say the extent to which tourism in the affected countries will be damaged depends on how long fear remains present in the minds of potential tourists .
" when it comes to such one-off events like the tsunamis , travelers typically have very short memories , " horst w. opaschowski , head of the bat leisure research institute in hamburg told the welt am sonntag .
" our experience shows that , after a year , most people will have forgotten about it . "
that has given tourism experts reason to hope that the tsunami disaster wo n't further burden the tourism industry as a whole , especially since it has just begun to emerge from the shadow of a long downturn caused by the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as the attacks in 2002 on bali , indonesia , and djerba , tunisia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the tunisian jewish community look at the fire damage in the ghriba synagogue in djerba , tunisia , on april 12 , 2002 .
" events of nature can be judged as such .
they 're contained to certain regions , and the phenomenon is explainable , " said tobias jüngert , spokesperson for the btw .
" with the threat of terrorism after september 11 or after the attacks in djerba , the fear of further attacks was much larger .
it 's impossible to narrow down or contain the motives of the attackers , the location of the attack or any possible repeats .
these two incidents really hurt the industry , but we 're in no way predicting any similar consequences as a result of the flood catastrophe .

angela merkel , germany 's opposition leader and head of the christian democratic union , said she completely supported the decision to increase the aid . others also welcomed the move , but said the german government should not neglect its long-term goals as a result . " germany mustn ’ t lose sight of the goal to cut extreme poverty and hunger around the world in half by 2015 , " jürgen lieser of the development policy association of german non-governmental organizations -lrb- venro -rrb- told dw-world . the new aid figure , which amounts to about two percent of the german budget in a year , takes germany to the top of the list of international donors who have rushed to provide millions of funds to the asian countries hit by the tsunami on dec .

germany is followed by japan -lrb- € 367 million -rrb- and the us -lrb- € 257 million -rrb- .

" we will be able to discuss the details , once we establish what the european union , the paris club -lrb- of creditor nations -rrb- and the g7 countries have agreed on , " he said .
but when pressed by reporters , he replied : " germany is giving € 500 million . this is not credit , it is money . " schröder said the move is " what the german public expects " and also denied that it was a political ploy aimed at winning support for his country 's bid to become a permanent member of the un security council . " we would do the same even if there no discussions on reform at the security council , " schröder said .
" they have nothing to do with each other . " the chancellor added that the aid would be used to finance concrete projects in the affected regions with emphasis on providing clean drinking water , supporting the health system and reconstructing schools . chancellor hails germans ' generosity before making the aid announcement , which came just after the european union fell silent for three minutes out of respect to the victims , he thanked the public for donating on an unprecedented scale .

berlin , which pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- in tsunami aid , has already violated the deficit ceiling three years in a row and is in danger of doing so again .

the commission ’ s monetary affairs spokeswoman amelia torres said the commission had taken the same position when faced with high spending for flood relief in the eastern part of the germany two years ago .
berlin , which pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- in tsunami aid , has already violated the deficit ceiling three years in a row and is in danger of doing so again .
but the commission doubts the significant contribution will have much effect on the country ’ s budget deficit which is expected to be about 3.9 percent of gdp . dw-world.de germany promises € 500 million in aid german chancellor schröder pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 661 million -rrb- towards reconstruction efforts in the tsunami-affected regions of south asia on wednesday , making germany the single largest donor so far .

the court in düsseldorf ruled that the government was within its rights to deny the unidentified man a visa because he “ is a member of an organization that supports international terrorism . ”
although the group is not included on a european union list of terrorist organizations , the court said germany was “ not legally bound ” by the list .
the lebanese man first arrived in germany in 1985 and was refused asylum but was given a visa for “ humanitarian reasons ” by authorities in the state of north rhine-westphalia , although the document had to be periodically renewed .
the extension was refused in 2003 when the man ’ s political affiliation became known . more briefs 05.01.2005 -pipe- thousands volunteer for world cup 05.01.2005 -pipe- france to extradite top german ex-official 04.01.2005 -pipe- german police : al qaeda trained 70,000 04.01.2005 -pipe- germany to raise aid to € 500 million 04.01.2005 -pipe- german shipyards to slash jobs 04.01.2005 -pipe- bayern munich to help sri lanka 03.01.2005 -pipe- calls to limit parliamentarians ' income 03.01.2005 -pipe- german historic town damaged by fire radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nhs highland is considering the creation of a midwife-led facility at caithness general hospital in wick .
campaigners say that could compromise safety - a claim rejected by midwives .
senior midwife rhona smith said : " we are trained to deal with normal pregnancies and midwives are the best professionals to do that . "
she added : " it gives midwives an opportunity to fully utilise their skills . "
local deliveries midwife-led units are being brought in throughout the country .
the number of mothers choosing to give birth at home is also swelling .
in the skye and lochalsh area , local deliveries have doubled in the year since a scheme was introduced .
we are looking at weeks and weeks of two midwives needing to be on call 24 hours a day mary burnside midwife midwife , morven clark , said : " you 're actually upgrading services to midwifery care .
i do n't necessarily see it as downgrading .
" when it 's mainly midwifery-led , there 's less intervention and a reduction in the -lrb- caesarean -rrb- section rate . "
but cash is needed to provide the extra staff required to meet the growth in home births .
chief midwife , mary burnside , said : " this could be a very demanding time for the midwives .
" we are looking at weeks and weeks of two midwives needing to be on call 24 hours a day in case someone goes into labour . "
she added : " unfortunately , that 's the thing with childbirth - you never know when someone going to have a baby , so there 's quite a big commitment from the midwives to be able to provide that . "

work is due to start next month on a £ 1.6m project to refurbish and light up clydebank 's a-listed titan crane .
clydebank re-built , the organisation set up to develop the area , said the final result would be " fantastic " .
now it is seeking support for a further £ 1.5m project to turn the crane into a visitor attraction .
the structure , which was used at the john brown shipyard , is one of five titan cranes designed by william arrol for clyde yards .
it helped with the building of numerous warships , as well as vessels like the lusitania , queen mary , britannia and the qe2 .
its importance made it a key target for the germans during the blitz , but the crane survived intact . "
people have a nostalgia for the yards and they want their past respected , but they also want to move forward " eleanor mcallister clydebank re-built eleanor mcallister , managing director of clydebank re-built , said it had not been used for almost a decade - but was still structurally sound .
the former john brown finally closed its doors in december 2000 when its then owners kvaerner decided to pull out of shipbuilding .
the land was subsequently sold to the private sector , which is looking to develop the 78-acre riverside site with a mixture of housing , retail and leisure uses .
clydebank re-built is a regeneration company which was created by a partnership between west dunbartonshire council and scottish enterprise dunbartonshire .
it has acquired 16 acres of the site , including the titan crane .
lighting scheme glasgow-based chris stewart architects have produced plans to light the structure , which has special considerations due to its location near a flight path .
" we have got to be careful that we do n't blind the pilots , " said ms mcallister .
" it is all led in the computer-driven lighting scheme .
it is going to be fantastic .
" we are calling it our angel of the north . "
work is due to start on site in february and is estimated to take between six and eight months .
the architects then went on to develop proposals to create a lift to the top of the crane , which would house a visitor centre on the area 's shipbuilding history .
efforts are currently under way to raise the £ 1.5m which would be needed to turn that idea into a reality .
" but even if we do n't get to that stage , if we can get to restore and light the crane it would be fantastic , " ms mcallister said .
the crane 's importance to the local community shone through when clydebank re-built carried out a public consultation on all its regeneration projects .
a groundswell of opinion came through at every workshop held by the organisation , even those on other subjects .
historical significance " people have a nostalgia for the yards and they want their past respected , but they also want to move forward , " said ms mcallister .
it is also hoped to remember the historical significance of the slipways where the famous ships were launched .
" they are concrete and they are under water , but we are going to do some kind of art works to mark where the queens entered the river for the first time , " she said .
one of the hopes for the regeneration project is that the use of creative design will begin to change people 's preconceptions of clydebank as a deprived area .

architects have produced plans to illuminate the crane work is due to start next month on a £ 1.6m project to refurbish and light up clydebank 's a-listed titan crane .
clydebank re-built , the organisation set up to develop the area , said the final result would be " fantastic " .
now it is seeking support for a further £ 1.5m project to turn the crane into a visitor attraction .
the structure , which was used at the john brown shipyard , is one of five titan cranes designed by william arrol for clyde yards .
it helped with the building of numerous warships , as well as vessels like the lusitania , queen mary , britannia and the qe2 .
its importance made it a key target for the germans during the blitz , but the crane survived intact .

the former john brown finally closed its doors in december 2000 when its then owners kvaerner decided to pull out of shipbuilding .
the land was subsequently sold to the private sector , which is looking to develop the 78-acre riverside site with a mixture of housing , retail and leisure uses .
clydebank re-built is a regeneration company which was created by a partnership between west dunbartonshire council and scottish enterprise dunbartonshire .
it has acquired 16 acres of the site , including the titan crane .
lighting scheme glasgow-based chris stewart architects have produced plans to light the structure , which has special considerations due to its location near a flight path .
" we have got to be careful that we do n't blind the pilots , " said ms mcallister .
" it is all led in the computer-driven lighting scheme .
it is going to be fantastic .
" we are calling it our angel of the north . "
there are proposals to install a new lift to the top work is due to start on site in february and is estimated to take between six and eight months .
the architects then went on to develop proposals to create a lift to the top of the crane , which would house a visitor centre on the area 's shipbuilding history .
efforts are currently under way to raise the £ 1.5m which would be needed to turn that idea into a reality .
" but even if we do n't get to that stage , if we can get to restore and light the crane it would be fantastic , " ms mcallister said .
the crane 's importance to the local community shone through when clydebank re-built carried out a public consultation on all its regeneration projects .

the city 's millstream project will now be called the shire country park .
the park links a four-mile , wooded walk along the river cole and the chinn brook .
it includes moseley bog , one of tolkien 's favourite childhood haunts .
in his books , the shire is the middle earth home of bilbo baggins and his fellow hobbits .
the name change results from consultations between environmental groups that look after the nature reserve , the tolkien society and members of birmingham city council .
john alden , the local authority 's cabinet member for leisure , sport and culture , said : " it is appropriate that birmingham should recognise jrr tolkien and his writing in this way .
" internationally acclaimed as a writer , he is an important part of the city 's cultural heritage .
bronze age " the shire country park will help raise the awareness of tolkien 's close ties with the city and attract visitors from far and wide , keen to discover the places that were such an important influence on the writer . "
tolkien , who was born in south africa on january 3 , 1892 but moved to birmingham at the age of three , is credited with using actual places for fictional locations in his books .
moseley bog , which dates back to the bronze age , is thought to have inspired the " old forest " in the lord of the rings , the last of the primeval woods in which tom bombadil lived .
sarehole mill , near the former family home on wake green road and now a museum , is viewed as being the " great mill " of the shire .
the 96ft-high perrot 's folly and the nearby waterworks tower , in edgbaston , are also seen by many as the real-life counterparts of the two towers of gondor .

tips from more than 100 critics and broadcasters have been compiled into a list of artists to watch in the next 12 months .
we are revealing one artist from the top five every day this week until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
kane robinson , better-known in the capital 's garage clubs and on pirate radio stations as kano , is hotly tipped to follow the likes of dizzee rascal and the so solid crew from the underground to the mainstream .
after working his way up the ranks of east london 's garage world for four years , kano , 19 , has emerged as one of the most distinctive voices and most talented homegrown rappers yet .
london 's garage scene , and its spin-off grime , may still be in their infancy compared to us hip-hop - but with a style true to his roots yet influenced by his idols from across the atlantic , kano could be one of the first to bridge the gap . "
to win fans on the underground is hard work - it 's skill and dedication " kano there was a glimpse of his potential in november when he appeared at the smash hits poll winners ' party - normally the domain of pure pop starlets rather than underground rappers - after coming second in a vote for viewers to choose their favourite new acts .
" it was a bit mad , " says kano , who had never heard of the smash hits poll winners ' party before appearing at it .
" it was a different kind of experience - a crowd i 'd never played to , little kids , and parents and all of that .
the song i was there with , it 's not even a crossover tune , it 's an underground tune . "
he puts his unexpected success down to the video for his first single , ps & qs : " a lot more people see your video than would turn on the pirate radio , so it gets you out there to the wider audience .
that 's always good . "
kano grew up in a reggae-loving jamaican family and a garage-loving area where rap battles were a part of normal playground rivalry .
he was a promising footballer , playing with chelsea at 11 before joining norwich , and his cousin , jon fortune , plays for charlton .
but he did not pursue that career and he also turned down a place at university .
" i 'd done the school thing , i 'd done the college thing , i 'm not really a big fan of uni , " he says . "
the street fans were our first fans and they heard us on pirate radio " kano instead , he concentrated on making it to the top in the highly competitive arena of mcing , where the crowd is fickle and every new pretender wants to knock the star off his perch .
" to win fans on the underground is hard work , " he says .
" i would n't say it 's something that 's just happened - it takes time , and it 's not like an accident or luck .
it 's skill and dedication .
" a lot of the time , the kids really decide - they have a favourite mc for one week and then they like someone else .
it 's changing all the time .
i 've had a lot of favourites come and go . "
he has won over the fans , he says , with meaningful lyrics about real life - the " turbulent inner life of britain 's excluded urban underclass " , as his press release puts it .
" to me , the lyrics are the most important thing , " he says .
" sometimes it seems like a lot of people are not making sense or they 're not trying hard enough or the lyrics sound a bit simple and basic . "
that matters when lyrics are the only thing separating different mcs who are all rapping over the same beat on a pirate radio station .
and most of his fans so far heard him on those illegal diy broadcasters .
" the street fans were our first fans and they heard us on pirate radio so that 's the most important thing for us , " he says .
but the mainstream is now calling after he was signed to the streets ' label , 679 .
he now classes himself as " an artist " rather than just an mc because he makes the complete musical package as well as rapping .
rap idols when asked whose careers he admires , the first names out of his mouth are american rap superstars jay-z and dr dre - but they are followed by less familiar names from closer to home : " ghetto , demon , kalashnikov . "
their very british urban styles will " one day " gain a foothold in the home of rap , the us , kano says .
" you have to remember jay-z 's had nine or 10 albums and dr dre 's made about a million songs , and they 're older than us .
we 're 19s and 20s and they 're all 35s , " he says .
" so we 've got a long time but our time will come .
hip-hop 's been going for ages and our music 's kind of new .
it 's been going for a few years .
" so maybe 20 years down the line we can be at their stage .
they might be another 20 years along the line as well ... "
the sound of 2005 survey was compiled from the tips of more than 100 impartial music critics and broadcasters , who were asked to give three names of artists they thought would be successful in 2005 .
the artists with the most tips were then ranked to compile the sound of 2005 list .

tips from more than 100 critics and broadcasters have been compiled into a list of artists to watch in the next 12 months .
we are revealing one artist from the top five every day this week until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
kane robinson , better-known in the capital 's garage clubs and on pirate radio stations as kano , is hotly tipped to follow the likes of dizzee rascal and the so solid crew from the underground to the mainstream .
after working his way up the ranks of east london 's garage world for four years , kano , 19 , has emerged as one of the most distinctive voices and most talented homegrown rappers yet .
london 's garage scene , and its spin-off grime , may still be in their infancy compared to us hip-hop - but with a style true to his roots yet influenced by his idols from across the atlantic , kano could be one of the first to bridge the gap .
to win fans on the underground is hard work - it 's skill and dedication kano there was a glimpse of his potential in november when he appeared at the smash hits poll winners ' party - normally the domain of pure pop starlets rather than underground rappers - after coming second in a vote for viewers to choose their favourite new acts .
" it was a bit mad , " says kano , who had never heard of the smash hits poll winners ' party before appearing at it .
" it was a different kind of experience - a crowd i 'd never played to , little kids , and parents and all of that .
the song i was there with , it 's not even a crossover tune , it 's an underground tune . "
he puts his unexpected success down to the video for his first single , ps & qs : " a lot more people see your video than would turn on the pirate radio , so it gets you out there to the wider audience .
that 's always good . "
kano grew up in a reggae-loving jamaican family and a garage-loving area where rap battles were a part of normal playground rivalry .
he was a promising footballer , playing with chelsea at 11 before joining norwich , and his cousin , jon fortune , plays for charlton .
but he did not pursue that career and he also turned down a place at university .
" i 'd done the school thing , i 'd done the college thing , i 'm not really a big fan of uni , " he says .
the street fans were our first fans and they heard us on pirate radio kano instead , he concentrated on making it to the top in the highly competitive arena of mcing , where the crowd is fickle and every new pretender wants to knock the star off his perch .
" to win fans on the underground is hard work , " he says .
" i would n't say it 's something that 's just happened - it takes time , and it 's not like an accident or luck .
it 's skill and dedication .
" a lot of the time , the kids really decide - they have a favourite mc for one week and then they like someone else .
it 's changing all the time .
i 've had a lot of favourites come and go . "
he has won over the fans , he says , with meaningful lyrics about real life - the " turbulent inner life of britain 's excluded urban underclass " , as his press release puts it .
" to me , the lyrics are the most important thing , " he says .
" sometimes it seems like a lot of people are not making sense or they 're not trying hard enough or the lyrics sound a bit simple and basic . "
that matters when lyrics are the only thing separating different mcs who are all rapping over the same beat on a pirate radio station .
and most of his fans so far heard him on those illegal diy broadcasters .
" the street fans were our first fans and they heard us on pirate radio so that 's the most important thing for us , " he says .
but the mainstream is now calling after he was signed to the streets ' label , 679 .
he now classes himself as " an artist " rather than just an mc because he makes the complete musical package as well as rapping .
rap idols when asked whose careers he admires , the first names out of his mouth are american rap superstars jay-z and dr dre - but they are followed by less familiar names from closer to home : " ghetto , demon , kalashnikov . "
their very british urban styles will " one day " gain a foothold in the home of rap , the us , kano says .
" you have to remember jay-z 's had nine or 10 albums and dr dre 's made about a million songs , and they 're older than us .
we 're 19s and 20s and they 're all 35s , " he says .
" so we 've got a long time but our time will come .
hip-hop 's been going for ages and our music 's kind of new .
it 's been going for a few years .
" so maybe 20 years down the line we can be at their stage .
they might be another 20 years along the line as well ... "
the sound of 2005 survey was compiled from the tips of more than 100 impartial music critics and broadcasters , who were asked to give three names of artists they thought would be successful in 2005 .
the artists with the most tips were then ranked to compile the sound of 2005 list .
