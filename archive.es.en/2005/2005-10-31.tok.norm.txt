" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr . " while the book reveals that large numbers of nazis spied for the stasi , their presence in other sectors of the communist has been well-documented . " even at the time we knew that people with a nazi past were being drafted into the volksarmee , " the " people 's army " of the gdr , said richard schröder , a philosophy professor at berlin 's humboldt university . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gdr secret police spied on future pope the east german secret police spied on the man who would become pope benedict xvi for 15 years , targeting him as one of the vatican 's fiercest opponents of communism , according to a report published sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .
analysts are pointing out that a failure by müntefering to push his candidate through may substantially weaken the spd in the crucial phase of coalition talks with the christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .

" the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .
analysts are pointing out that a failure by müntefering to push his candidate through may substantially weaken the spd in the crucial phase of coalition talks with the christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .
by the same token , some of the world 's most renowned companies and their representatives reaped great rewards from the system . germa n y got several me n tio n s even un employees were not blind to what was going on .
the german hans von sponek , who oversaw the oil-for-food program in baghdad , became one of the most prolific opponents of the regime of sanctions .
the report certified that the former united nations employee had " not violated un regulations , " but added that those same regulations should be reviewed .
since leaving the un , von sponek has worked for at least two companies involved in " iraq business " during his time in baghdad . but let 's get back to the kick-backs and bribes .
some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .
why then , should those who are on the front line when it comes to earning money , be struck by pangs of conscience ? peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party . " i think this approach is pretty scandalous , " the spokesman for the social democrats ' right wing , johannes kahrs , said of nahles .

" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 31.10.2005 opinion : the moral of the oil-for-food tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sanctions crippled the flow of food to the iraqi people the un oil-for-food program was born out of humanitarian good intention , but in the past months , there have been multiple accusations about the corruption practices which it spawned . it could be a lesson for future attempts to impose sanctions on a rich nation , on iran for example , should it not back down on its nuclear program .
it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .
by the same token , some of the world 's most renowned companies and their representatives reaped great rewards from the system . germa n y got several me n tio n s even un employees were not blind to what was going on .
the german hans von sponek , who oversaw the oil-for-food program in baghdad , became one of the most prolific opponents of the regime of sanctions .
the report certified that the former united nations employee had " not violated un regulations , " but added that those same regulations should be reviewed .
since leaving the un , von sponek has worked for at least two companies involved in " iraq business " during his time in baghdad . but let 's get back to the kick-backs and bribes .
some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .
why then , should those who are on the front line when it comes to earning money , be struck by pangs of conscience ? peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .

" i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .
by the same token , some of the world 's most renowned companies and their representatives reaped great rewards from the system . germa n y got several me n tio n s even un employees were not blind to what was going on .
the german hans von sponek , who oversaw the oil-for-food program in baghdad , became one of the most prolific opponents of the regime of sanctions .
the report certified that the former united nations employee had " not violated un regulations , " but added that those same regulations should be reviewed .
since leaving the un , von sponek has worked for at least two companies involved in " iraq business " during his time in baghdad . but let 's get back to the kick-backs and bribes .
some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .
why then , should those who are on the front line when it comes to earning money , be struck by pangs of conscience ? peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .

" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr . " while the book reveals that large numbers of nazis spied for the stasi , their presence in other sectors of the communist has been well-documented . " even at the time we knew that people with a nazi past were being drafted into the volksarmee , " the " people 's army " of the gdr , said richard schröder , a philosophy professor at berlin 's humboldt university . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gdr secret police spied on future pope the east german secret police spied on the man who would become pope benedict xvi for 15 years , targeting him as one of the vatican 's fiercest opponents of communism , according to a report published sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 31.10.2005 plenty of coaching misery to go around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach sven-göran eriksson has been facing hostile english press jürgen klinsmann has some company around europe when it comes to national soccer coaches being under fire .
be it in england , france or spain , the expectations are high and the pressure correspondingly great . if german manager jürgen klinsmann , who came face to face with his critics this week , ever feels like pouring out his heart he could always phone a friend - sven , raymond , or luis would do . klinsmann was a born winner on the pitch but the 1990 world cup hero arguably had one of the toughest challenges of his professional life when he appeared before bundesliga bosses at last week 's showdown to defend his idiosyncratic training methods . klinsmann though is by no means alone in feeling the heat - just ask england 's sven-goran eriksson , raymond domenech of france , or spain 's luis aragones .
all three have to a greater or lesser degree been hauled over the coals as they 've guided their teams through world cup qualifying , criticism raining down despite two of the trio finishing top of their respective groups . if the four managers were to ever form a self-help group to deal with the strains of leadership , klinsmann would undisputedly be in the chair .
for many the 41-year-old golden boy of german soccer has lost some of his shine since his appointment - his first stab at management - as rudi völler 's successor after germany 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign . promising start has turned sour a creditable third to brazil and argentina in the confederations cup gave him breathing space , but the knives have come out in the wake of some pretty moderate performances with friendly losses to slovakia and turkey , a draw with the netherlands and uninspiring wins over south africa and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's uli hoeness has been one of klinsmann 's loudest detractors the main concerns are klinsmann 's refusal to base himself in germany ; his introduction of american-style training programs ; his perceived over-reliance on skipper michael ballack ; and a leaky defense . " klinsmann , why are we so bad ? " asked the bild tabloid bluntly after the istanbul defeat . the welt am sonntag weekly wrote at the time : " the defence played as if they had just seen each other for the first time . " " welcome to germany , where you have nothing to fear from your hosts , " was the caustic headline in the bild am sonntag newspaper and directed at teams from europe , africa and south america after the final round of world cup qualifiers . eriksson knows the feeling last week 's meeting with the country 's top flight managers saw a compromise reached where a group of six senior german soccer officials , including two of klinsmann 's fiercest critics , bayern munich 's uli hoeness and schalke 04 's rudi assauer , will offer the free-spirited former world cup winning striker ' guidance ' .
if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .
the main gripe seems to be his soft approach and he gave his critics short shrift when asked if he could ever win them over . " some of them maybe not .
some of them think i should resign tomorrow , " he said .
" but we have won our group and we have a good team , the best since i came to this country .
i would be an extremely bad manager -lrb- coach -rrb- and a bad professional if i resigned tomorrow .
i have absolutely no intention of doing that whatsoever . " 1998 champs underperforming ? over in paris , domenech 's tenure as france coach has also come under critical scrutiny despite the 1998 champions sealing their passage to germany as winners of their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the world cup group did n't protect france 's raymond domenech from the press " whether france qualifies or not , there has to be a huge question mark over his place in french soccer and his method of management given the performances of the team in qualifying , " was france football magazine 's damning verdict on his reign . yet domenech , booed before the final 4-0 qualifier win over cyprus , can find some comfort from an opinion poll in le journal du dimanche in which 79 percent believed he should carry on in the hot seat . and as for aragones , who was fined last year for racist comments about thierry henry , he has a tense few weeks ahead of him as he prepares spain , constant underachievers on the international stage , for the play-offs . you can almost hear the sound of knives being sharpened up and down the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party . " i think this approach is pretty scandalous , " the spokesman for the social democrats ' right wing , johannes kahrs , said of nahles .

" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr . " while the book reveals that large numbers of nazis spied for the stasi , their presence in other sectors of the communist has been well-documented . " even at the time we knew that people with a nazi past were being drafted into the volksarmee , " the " people 's army " of the gdr , said richard schröder , a philosophy professor at berlin 's humboldt university . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gdr secret police spied on future pope the east german secret police spied on the man who would become pope benedict xvi for 15 years , targeting him as one of the vatican 's fiercest opponents of communism , according to a report published sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .
analysts are pointing out that a failure by müntefering to push his candidate through may substantially weaken the spd in the crucial phase of coalition talks with the christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party . " i think this approach is pretty scandalous , " the spokesman for the social democrats ' right wing , johannes kahrs , said of nahles .

be it in england , france or spain , the expectations are high and the pressure correspondingly great . if german manager jürgen klinsmann , who came face to face with his critics this week , ever feels like pouring out his heart he could always phone a friend - sven , raymond , or luis would do . klinsmann was a born winner on the pitch but the 1990 world cup hero arguably had one of the toughest challenges of his professional life when he appeared before bundesliga bosses at last week 's showdown to defend his idiosyncratic training methods . klinsmann though is by no means alone in feeling the heat - just ask england 's sven-goran eriksson , raymond domenech of france , or spain 's luis aragones .
all three have to a greater or lesser degree been hauled over the coals as they 've guided their teams through world cup qualifying , criticism raining down despite two of the trio finishing top of their respective groups . if the four managers were to ever form a self-help group to deal with the strains of leadership , klinsmann would undisputedly be in the chair .
for many the 41-year-old golden boy of german soccer has lost some of his shine since his appointment - his first stab at management - as rudi völler 's successor after germany 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign . promising start has turned sour a creditable third to brazil and argentina in the confederations cup gave him breathing space , but the knives have come out in the wake of some pretty moderate performances with friendly losses to slovakia and turkey , a draw with the netherlands and uninspiring wins over south africa and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's uli hoeness has been one of klinsmann 's loudest detractors the main concerns are klinsmann 's refusal to base himself in germany ; his introduction of american-style training programs ; his perceived over-reliance on skipper michael ballack ; and a leaky defense .

if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .

restaurants are following suit , removing poultry from their menus . poultry is doing a disappearing act from german kitchens and restaurants , just ahead of the prime poultry season .
on nov .
10 , germans celebrate the feast day of st. martin - normally with a feast of roast goose .
then there 's christmas dinner , which usually features some kind of poultry .
but already top restaurants are announcing a change in plans .
the respected hotel traube in the black forest region has completely redone its holiday season menu , with not a chicken or turkey in sight . german television chef tim mälzer told fans not to expect any poultry at his restaurant das weisse haus for the time being .
and one of the country 's top gourmets , harald wohlfahrt , has substituted beef filet for roast chicken at his hamburg-based dinner show " palazzo " for " psychological reasons . " poultry industry suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say such images are ruining consumers ' appetite for poultry as the european union becomes the next region to grapple with the threat of bird flu , the virus has already impacted germany 's eating habits and taken a toll on the nation 's poultry industry . the association of german chefs has emphasized that with proper preparation , poultry poses no risk of infection to consumers .
but klaus-wilfried meyer , head of the association 's committee for nutrition and health , also said that , given consumer reaction , restaurants have no choice but to respond the way they have . " i see it very realistically , " meyer said .
" consumers are unsure .
they 're not familiar enough with this issue , despite the thorough coverage in the media .
if you 're a chef and you cook poultry properly , there 's no risk .
but if customers do n't believe it , they wo n't eat it , and that 's wasted money . " fears about consuming poultry products are also affecting european importers , exporters and suppliers .
dutch poultry exporters - who , with a total of 600,000 tons per year are the eu 's largest group of poultry exporters - have reported a 20 percent decrease in turnover .
a third of their exports end up on the german market .
the european egg , poultry and game association -lrb- epega -rrb- , which mainly represents importers , has reported a 10 percent fall in sales . germany 's rewe trading group , one of europe 's leading food retailers , refrained from giving any concrete figures , but said it had noticed consumer reluctance to buy poultry because of a " slight " decline in turnover . " the massive amount of media reporting -lrb- on bird flu -rrb- is responsible for this , not the actual situation , " said rewe press spokesperson andreas krämer .
" the ministry for consumer protection and scientific institutes such as the robert koch institute agree that the risk of consumers getting infected through poultry products is very low .
but it 's understandable that when customers hear and read so much about bird flu it ruins their appetite for poultry . " passing trend ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chickens sit in their barn in neu wulmstorf near hamburg germans consumers have grown used to food scandals in recent years .
meat producers saw sales plummet when scares such as mad cow disease or foot-and-mouth disease were at their peak - and then recover again once the panic had subsided .
meyer said he expects the same behavior with the bird flu scare . " scandals come and go , and consumers always react like this , " he said .
" when this scandal dies out , poultry sales will go up again .
we saw that with the recent scare about contaminated fish .
afterwards , people so wanted to eat it again that sales went up to even higher levels than before the scandal . " meanwhile , experts are doing their best to reassure consumers that poultry imports from bird flu-infected countries have been banned and that the basic hygiene rules for cooking poultry have n't changed . " any virus will be killed in the cooking process , " said susanne glasmacher of the robert koch institute in berlin .
" and if only due to the risk of salmonella poisoning , poultry should only be eaten if it 's cooked through . " as for chef klaus-wilfried meyer , he intends to go on living - and eating - as normal .
and that includes tucking into a meal of roast goose on st. martin 's day . " nothing will stop me from that , " he said .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party . " i think this approach is pretty scandalous , " the spokesman for the social democrats ' right wing , johannes kahrs , said of nahles . " the party can not afford , in the middle of coalition negotiations , to have our leader weakened .

meat producers saw sales plummet when scares such as mad cow disease or foot-and-mouth disease were at their peak - and then recover again once the panic had subsided .
meyer said he expects the same behavior with the bird flu scare . " scandals come and go , and consumers always react like this , " he said .
" when this scandal dies out , poultry sales will go up again .
we saw that with the recent scare about contaminated fish .
afterwards , people so wanted to eat it again that sales went up to even higher levels than before the scandal . " meanwhile , experts are doing their best to reassure consumers that poultry imports from bird flu-infected countries have been banned and that the basic hygiene rules for cooking poultry have n't changed . " any virus will be killed in the cooking process , " said susanne glasmacher of the robert koch institute in berlin .
" and if only due to the risk of salmonella poisoning , poultry should only be eaten if it 's cooked through . " as for chef klaus-wilfried meyer , he intends to go on living - and eating - as normal .
and that includes tucking into a meal of roast goose on st. martin 's day . " nothing will stop me from that , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .
analysts are pointing out that a failure by müntefering to push his candidate through may substantially weaken the spd in the crucial phase of coalition talks with the christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

be it in england , france or spain , the expectations are high and the pressure correspondingly great . if german manager jürgen klinsmann , who came face to face with his critics this week , ever feels like pouring out his heart he could always phone a friend - sven , raymond , or luis would do . klinsmann was a born winner on the pitch but the 1990 world cup hero arguably had one of the toughest challenges of his professional life when he appeared before bundesliga bosses at last week 's showdown to defend his idiosyncratic training methods . klinsmann though is by no means alone in feeling the heat - just ask england 's sven-goran eriksson , raymond domenech of france , or spain 's luis aragones .
all three have to a greater or lesser degree been hauled over the coals as they 've guided their teams through world cup qualifying , criticism raining down despite two of the trio finishing top of their respective groups . if the four managers were to ever form a self-help group to deal with the strains of leadership , klinsmann would undisputedly be in the chair .
for many the 41-year-old golden boy of german soccer has lost some of his shine since his appointment - his first stab at management - as rudi völler 's successor after germany 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign . promising start has turned sour a creditable third to brazil and argentina in the confederations cup gave him breathing space , but the knives have come out in the wake of some pretty moderate performances with friendly losses to slovakia and turkey , a draw with the netherlands and uninspiring wins over south africa and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's uli hoeness has been one of klinsmann 's loudest detractors the main concerns are klinsmann 's refusal to base himself in germany ; his introduction of american-style training programs ; his perceived over-reliance on skipper michael ballack ; and a leaky defense . " klinsmann , why are we so bad ? " asked the bild tabloid bluntly after the istanbul defeat . the welt am sonntag weekly wrote at the time : " the defence played as if they had just seen each other for the first time . " " welcome to germany , where you have nothing to fear from your hosts , " was the caustic headline in the bild am sonntag newspaper and directed at teams from europe , africa and south america after the final round of world cup qualifiers . eriksson knows the feeling last week 's meeting with the country 's top flight managers saw a compromise reached where a group of six senior german soccer officials , including two of klinsmann 's fiercest critics , bayern munich 's uli hoeness and schalke 04 's rudi assauer , will offer the free-spirited former world cup winning striker ' guidance ' .
if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .
the main gripe seems to be his soft approach and he gave his critics short shrift when asked if he could ever win them over . " some of them maybe not .
some of them think i should resign tomorrow , " he said .
" but we have won our group and we have a good team , the best since i came to this country .

meyer said he expects the same behavior with the bird flu scare . " scandals come and go , and consumers always react like this , " he said .

only 1.1 million tickets for the global soccer showpiece have been put on public sale . corporate tickets finally making it to the fans however , this controversial allocation may yet pay dividends to some lucky supporters .
world cup organizers expect some of the tickets allocated to national associations and the other groups to be returned , and fans can apply for places on the waiting list for those returns between november 2 and november 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt of the german world cup organizing committee " anyone who 's taken a flight knows about waiting lists , " said horst r. schmidt , the organizing committee vice president in charge of ticketing , in an interview with reuters .
" if someone fails to fails to show up or hands back their ticket , the person at the top of the waiting list takes their place . " venue not team specific tickets up for grabs while this may open up the possibility of more fans getting their hands on the holy grail of soccer tickets , they will not have any say as to which games they wish to attend .
the draw for the tournament does not take place until december 9 but they will be able to pick out specific venues that interest them . priority for waiting list places will be given to people who made unsuccessful applications for tickets in the first sales phase as well as those who bought team specific tickets for teams which subsequently failed to qualify for the tournament . the 812,000 tickets that were made available to ordinary fans in the first two sales windows were oversubscribed by 10 to one .
an estimated 300,000 further tickets will be up for grabs from december 12 to january 15 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

be it in england , france or spain , the expectations are high and the pressure correspondingly great . if german manager jürgen klinsmann , who came face to face with his critics this week , ever feels like pouring out his heart he could always phone a friend - sven , raymond , or luis would do . klinsmann was a born winner on the pitch but the 1990 world cup hero arguably had one of the toughest challenges of his professional life when he appeared before bundesliga bosses at last week 's showdown to defend his idiosyncratic training methods . klinsmann though is by no means alone in feeling the heat - just ask england 's sven-goran eriksson , raymond domenech of france , or spain 's luis aragones .
all three have to a greater or lesser degree been hauled over the coals as they 've guided their teams through world cup qualifying , criticism raining down despite two of the trio finishing top of their respective groups . if the four managers were to ever form a self-help group to deal with the strains of leadership , klinsmann would undisputedly be in the chair .
for many the 41-year-old golden boy of german soccer has lost some of his shine since his appointment - his first stab at management - as rudi völler 's successor after germany 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign . promising start has turned sour a creditable third to brazil and argentina in the confederations cup gave him breathing space , but the knives have come out in the wake of some pretty moderate performances with friendly losses to slovakia and turkey , a draw with the netherlands and uninspiring wins over south africa and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's uli hoeness has been one of klinsmann 's loudest detractors the main concerns are klinsmann 's refusal to base himself in germany ; his introduction of american-style training programs ; his perceived over-reliance on skipper michael ballack ; and a leaky defense . " klinsmann , why are we so bad ? " asked the bild tabloid bluntly after the istanbul defeat . the welt am sonntag weekly wrote at the time : " the defence played as if they had just seen each other for the first time . " " welcome to germany , where you have nothing to fear from your hosts , " was the caustic headline in the bild am sonntag newspaper and directed at teams from europe , africa and south america after the final round of world cup qualifiers . eriksson knows the feeling last week 's meeting with the country 's top flight managers saw a compromise reached where a group of six senior german soccer officials , including two of klinsmann 's fiercest critics , bayern munich 's uli hoeness and schalke 04 's rudi assauer , will offer the free-spirited former world cup winning striker ' guidance ' .
if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .
the main gripe seems to be his soft approach and he gave his critics short shrift when asked if he could ever win them over . " some of them maybe not .
some of them think i should resign tomorrow , " he said .
" but we have won our group and we have a good team , the best since i came to this country .
i would be an extremely bad manager -lrb- coach -rrb- and a bad professional if i resigned tomorrow .
i have absolutely no intention of doing that whatsoever . " 1998 champs underperforming ? over in paris , domenech 's tenure as france coach has also come under critical scrutiny despite the 1998 champions sealing their passage to germany as winners of their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the world cup group did n't protect france 's raymond domenech from the press " whether france qualifies or not , there has to be a huge question mark over his place in french soccer and his method of management given the performances of the team in qualifying , " was france football magazine 's damning verdict on his reign . yet domenech , booed before the final 4-0 qualifier win over cyprus , can find some comfort from an opinion poll in le journal du dimanche in which 79 percent believed he should carry on in the hot seat . and as for aragones , who was fined last year for racist comments about thierry henry , he has a tense few weeks ahead of him as he prepares spain , constant underachievers on the international stage , for the play-offs . you can almost hear the sound of knives being sharpened up and down the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 müntefering to step down as spd leader großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering 's future is up in the air franz müntefering has surprisingly announced that he will not run for re-election as leader of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in november after losing a key power struggle monday . müntefering was meant to serve as vice chancellor and labor minister in a grand coalition government with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , but has now said that he is not sure whether he will do so .
" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .
by the same token , some of the world 's most renowned companies and their representatives reaped great rewards from the system . germa n y got several me n tio n s even un employees were not blind to what was going on .
the german hans von sponek , who oversaw the oil-for-food program in baghdad , became one of the most prolific opponents of the regime of sanctions .
the report certified that the former united nations employee had " not violated un regulations , " but added that those same regulations should be reviewed .
since leaving the un , von sponek has worked for at least two companies involved in " iraq business " during his time in baghdad . but let 's get back to the kick-backs and bribes .
some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .

" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr . " while the book reveals that large numbers of nazis spied for the stasi , their presence in other sectors of the communist has been well-documented . " even at the time we knew that people with a nazi past were being drafted into the volksarmee , " the " people 's army " of the gdr , said richard schröder , a philosophy professor at berlin 's humboldt university . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gdr secret police spied on future pope the east german secret police spied on the man who would become pope benedict xvi for 15 years , targeting him as one of the vatican 's fiercest opponents of communism , according to a report published sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .
by the same token , some of the world 's most renowned companies and their representatives reaped great rewards from the system . germa n y got several me n tio n s even un employees were not blind to what was going on .
the german hans von sponek , who oversaw the oil-for-food program in baghdad , became one of the most prolific opponents of the regime of sanctions .
the report certified that the former united nations employee had " not violated un regulations , " but added that those same regulations should be reviewed .
since leaving the un , von sponek has worked for at least two companies involved in " iraq business " during his time in baghdad . but let 's get back to the kick-backs and bribes .
some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .
why then , should those who are on the front line when it comes to earning money , be struck by pangs of conscience ? peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .

restaurants are following suit , removing poultry from their menus . poultry is doing a disappearing act from german kitchens and restaurants , just ahead of the prime poultry season .
on nov .
10 , germans celebrate the feast day of st. martin - normally with a feast of roast goose .
then there 's christmas dinner , which usually features some kind of poultry .
but already top restaurants are announcing a change in plans .
the respected hotel traube in the black forest region has completely redone its holiday season menu , with not a chicken or turkey in sight . german television chef tim mälzer told fans not to expect any poultry at his restaurant das weisse haus for the time being .
and one of the country 's top gourmets , harald wohlfahrt , has substituted beef filet for roast chicken at his hamburg-based dinner show " palazzo " for " psychological reasons . " poultry industry suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say such images are ruining consumers ' appetite for poultry as the european union becomes the next region to grapple with the threat of bird flu , the virus has already impacted germany 's eating habits and taken a toll on the nation 's poultry industry . the association of german chefs has emphasized that with proper preparation , poultry poses no risk of infection to consumers .
but klaus-wilfried meyer , head of the association 's committee for nutrition and health , also said that , given consumer reaction , restaurants have no choice but to respond the way they have . " i see it very realistically , " meyer said .
" consumers are unsure .
they 're not familiar enough with this issue , despite the thorough coverage in the media .
if you 're a chef and you cook poultry properly , there 's no risk .
but if customers do n't believe it , they wo n't eat it , and that 's wasted money . " fears about consuming poultry products are also affecting european importers , exporters and suppliers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .
analysts are pointing out that a failure by müntefering to push his candidate through may substantially weaken the spd in the crucial phase of coalition talks with the christian democrats . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's spd reveals cabinet members spd leader franz müntefering announced the line-up of the party 's nominations for cabinet posts in the new government thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 bird flu makes germans lose appetite for poultry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans will be going without goose this holiday season the german poultry industry is feeling the pinch as consumers react to bird flu by buying fewer chicken , turkey and other poultry products .
restaurants are following suit , removing poultry from their menus . poultry is doing a disappearing act from german kitchens and restaurants , just ahead of the prime poultry season .
on nov .
10 , germans celebrate the feast day of st. martin - normally with a feast of roast goose .
then there 's christmas dinner , which usually features some kind of poultry .
but already top restaurants are announcing a change in plans .
the respected hotel traube in the black forest region has completely redone its holiday season menu , with not a chicken or turkey in sight . german television chef tim mälzer told fans not to expect any poultry at his restaurant das weisse haus for the time being .
and one of the country 's top gourmets , harald wohlfahrt , has substituted beef filet for roast chicken at his hamburg-based dinner show " palazzo " for " psychological reasons . " poultry industry suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say such images are ruining consumers ' appetite for poultry as the european union becomes the next region to grapple with the threat of bird flu , the virus has already impacted germany 's eating habits and taken a toll on the nation 's poultry industry . the association of german chefs has emphasized that with proper preparation , poultry poses no risk of infection to consumers .
but klaus-wilfried meyer , head of the association 's committee for nutrition and health , also said that , given consumer reaction , restaurants have no choice but to respond the way they have . " i see it very realistically , " meyer said .
" consumers are unsure .
they 're not familiar enough with this issue , despite the thorough coverage in the media .
if you 're a chef and you cook poultry properly , there 's no risk .
but if customers do n't believe it , they wo n't eat it , and that 's wasted money . " fears about consuming poultry products are also affecting european importers , exporters and suppliers .
dutch poultry exporters - who , with a total of 600,000 tons per year are the eu 's largest group of poultry exporters - have reported a 20 percent decrease in turnover .
a third of their exports end up on the german market .
the european egg , poultry and game association -lrb- epega -rrb- , which mainly represents importers , has reported a 10 percent fall in sales . germany 's rewe trading group , one of europe 's leading food retailers , refrained from giving any concrete figures , but said it had noticed consumer reluctance to buy poultry because of a " slight " decline in turnover . " the massive amount of media reporting -lrb- on bird flu -rrb- is responsible for this , not the actual situation , " said rewe press spokesperson andreas krämer .
" the ministry for consumer protection and scientific institutes such as the robert koch institute agree that the risk of consumers getting infected through poultry products is very low .
but it 's understandable that when customers hear and read so much about bird flu it ruins their appetite for poultry . " passing trend ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chickens sit in their barn in neu wulmstorf near hamburg germans consumers have grown used to food scandals in recent years .
meat producers saw sales plummet when scares such as mad cow disease or foot-and-mouth disease were at their peak - and then recover again once the panic had subsided .
meyer said he expects the same behavior with the bird flu scare . " scandals come and go , and consumers always react like this , " he said .
" when this scandal dies out , poultry sales will go up again .
we saw that with the recent scare about contaminated fish .
afterwards , people so wanted to eat it again that sales went up to even higher levels than before the scandal . " meanwhile , experts are doing their best to reassure consumers that poultry imports from bird flu-infected countries have been banned and that the basic hygiene rules for cooking poultry have n't changed .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .

22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .

some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .

restaurants are following suit , removing poultry from their menus . poultry is doing a disappearing act from german kitchens and restaurants , just ahead of the prime poultry season .
on nov .
10 , germans celebrate the feast day of st. martin - normally with a feast of roast goose .
then there 's christmas dinner , which usually features some kind of poultry .
but already top restaurants are announcing a change in plans .
the respected hotel traube in the black forest region has completely redone its holiday season menu , with not a chicken or turkey in sight . german television chef tim mälzer told fans not to expect any poultry at his restaurant das weisse haus for the time being .
and one of the country 's top gourmets , harald wohlfahrt , has substituted beef filet for roast chicken at his hamburg-based dinner show " palazzo " for " psychological reasons . " poultry industry suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say such images are ruining consumers ' appetite for poultry as the european union becomes the next region to grapple with the threat of bird flu , the virus has already impacted germany 's eating habits and taken a toll on the nation 's poultry industry . the association of german chefs has emphasized that with proper preparation , poultry poses no risk of infection to consumers .
but klaus-wilfried meyer , head of the association 's committee for nutrition and health , also said that , given consumer reaction , restaurants have no choice but to respond the way they have . " i see it very realistically , " meyer said .
" consumers are unsure .
they 're not familiar enough with this issue , despite the thorough coverage in the media .
if you 're a chef and you cook poultry properly , there 's no risk .
but if customers do n't believe it , they wo n't eat it , and that 's wasted money . " fears about consuming poultry products are also affecting european importers , exporters and suppliers .
dutch poultry exporters - who , with a total of 600,000 tons per year are the eu 's largest group of poultry exporters - have reported a 20 percent decrease in turnover .
a third of their exports end up on the german market .
the european egg , poultry and game association -lrb- epega -rrb- , which mainly represents importers , has reported a 10 percent fall in sales . germany 's rewe trading group , one of europe 's leading food retailers , refrained from giving any concrete figures , but said it had noticed consumer reluctance to buy poultry because of a " slight " decline in turnover . " the massive amount of media reporting -lrb- on bird flu -rrb- is responsible for this , not the actual situation , " said rewe press spokesperson andreas krämer .
" the ministry for consumer protection and scientific institutes such as the robert koch institute agree that the risk of consumers getting infected through poultry products is very low .
but it 's understandable that when customers hear and read so much about bird flu it ruins their appetite for poultry .

if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .

only 1.1 million tickets for the global soccer showpiece have been put on public sale . corporate tickets finally making it to the fans however , this controversial allocation may yet pay dividends to some lucky supporters .
world cup organizers expect some of the tickets allocated to national associations and the other groups to be returned , and fans can apply for places on the waiting list for those returns between november 2 and november 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt of the german world cup organizing committee " anyone who 's taken a flight knows about waiting lists , " said horst r. schmidt , the organizing committee vice president in charge of ticketing , in an interview with reuters .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .

the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party . " i think this approach is pretty scandalous , " the spokesman for the social democrats ' right wing , johannes kahrs , said of nahles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.10.2005 spd in-fighting threatens coalition talks as coalition talks continue in germany on monday , a leadership struggle is raging within the ranks of the social democrats .
at issue is who should don the cap of spd secretary general . the battle is between spd leader , franz müntefering 's trusted aid and favorite candidate , kajo wasserhövel and the leftist andrea nahles .
on sunday , in a contest , which is being viewed as his first test of authority , müntefering failed to push through his candidate for the pivotal post of secretary general . the spd 's inner leadership circle did n't toe müntefering 's line , refusing to endorse wasserhövel as the only candidate .
müntefering grudgingly admitted that the decision had to be postponed until monday afternoon because some presidium members apparently favored a different candidate . " i 've been trying to make it clear that kajo wasserhövel would be the best choice for the post of secretary general , but unfortunately , others view this differently , " müntefering said . leftist favorite the spd leftwing is fielding andrea nahles , the 35-year-old former leader of the party 's youth organization , who won herself a reputation for her outspoken criticism of outgoing chancellor schröder 's reformist political course . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea nahles , spd together with a number of other left-wingers , she drummed up inner-party support for more social policies , creating a movement which is said to have forced schröder into calling early elections to prevent an open revolt in the spd . nahles enjoys powerful backing from cabinet ministers and regional party leaders , including that of wolfgang jüttner , who leads the spd in the state of lower saxony . " the issue at stake now is how the party positions itself as it is being forced into a grand coalition government with its strongest political rival , " he said .
" andrea nahles is better suited to give the party some breathing space and to move it forward in accordance with its own platform . " solutio n scheduled for mo n day kajo wasserhövel , however , has been franz müntefering right-hand man for many years .
the 43-year-old has received much praise for his summer election campaign which led to schröder giving the conservatives a good run for their money .
ludwig stiegler , deputy parliamentary leader of the spd , said he believes müntefering 's candidate will ultimately get the job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd party chariman , franz muentefering " franz müntefering will get the upper hand , " he said .
" it 's abundantly clear that any party leader needs full trust in his general secretary .
i can not imagine that an spd party conference in november will first endorse müntefering as party leader and then reject his nomination for the post of secretary general . " the spd leadership will make a new attempt on monday to resolve the untimely power struggle .

only 1.1 million tickets for the global soccer showpiece have been put on public sale . corporate tickets finally making it to the fans however , this controversial allocation may yet pay dividends to some lucky supporters .

" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr . " while the book reveals that large numbers of nazis spied for the stasi , their presence in other sectors of the communist has been well-documented . " even at the time we knew that people with a nazi past were being drafted into the volksarmee , " the " people 's army " of the gdr , said richard schröder , a philosophy professor at berlin 's humboldt university . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gdr secret police spied on future pope the east german secret police spied on the man who would become pope benedict xvi for 15 years , targeting him as one of the vatican 's fiercest opponents of communism , according to a report published sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 31.10.2005 opinion : the moral of the oil-for-food tale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sanctions crippled the flow of food to the iraqi people the un oil-for-food program was born out of humanitarian good intention , but in the past months , there have been multiple accusations about the corruption practices which it spawned . it could be a lesson for future attempts to impose sanctions on a rich nation , on iran for example , should it not back down on its nuclear program .
it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .
following the kuwait war , the united nations decided that food , medication and other essential goods should be paid for out of the limited iraqi oil exports . a 600-page investigative report into the oil-for-food program reveals how it developed into a miraculous money-making machine .
saddam hussein systematically demanded kickbacks for almost every import , lining his pocket with billions , with which he was able to support the western opponents to sanctions , the so-called peace activists .
by the same token , some of the world 's most renowned companies and their representatives reaped great rewards from the system . germa n y got several me n tio n s even un employees were not blind to what was going on .
the german hans von sponek , who oversaw the oil-for-food program in baghdad , became one of the most prolific opponents of the regime of sanctions .
the report certified that the former united nations employee had " not violated un regulations , " but added that those same regulations should be reviewed .
since leaving the un , von sponek has worked for at least two companies involved in " iraq business " during his time in baghdad . but let 's get back to the kick-backs and bribes .
some of germany 's most important companies also get a mention in the report .
some have declined to comment , whilst others are trying to play down their role in the corruption scandal or say that even prosecutors have not been interested so far -lrb- that 's no longer the case as state prosecutors in stuttgart are mulling an official probe -rrb- . there have been some suggestions that operating a system of bribery and corruption when dealing with less democratic countries to out-smart competitors , was in fact , all in a day 's work .
and perhaps there is something in that , as for a long time , it was even possible to set such expenditure off against tax . given that backdrop , how should anyone suddenly develop a sense of moral value ?
business is business and morals are something for others to worry about .
political leaders themselves show signs of this all too frequently .
why then , should those who are on the front line when it comes to earning money , be struck by pangs of conscience ? peter philipp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler probed in oil-for-food scandal germany has had little to do with the scandals around the un 's scandal-plagued oil-for-food program .
now , the american sec is investigating possible wrongdoing by daimlerchrysler in connection with the program .

it is immensely difficult to slap trade restrictions on such countries , and with the petrodollar threatening to seduce those whose governments led the calls for sanctions in the first place , it is even more difficult to make sure the restrictions are adhered to . in the case of saddam hussein 's iraq , some 2,000 international companies succumbed to the temptation to make a virtue out of adversity - or , moreover , to make a lucrative profit , for themselves and the dictator in baghdad , from the sanction-induced destitution .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .

the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party .

" i left my decision open as to whether i would belong to the cabinet after the next party congress " on november 14-16 , müntefering told reporters .
the decision came after the unofficial leader of the social democrat party 's left wing , andrea nahles , won a vote by the party 's board to become the next spd secretary general , roundly beating müntefering 's hand-picked candidate kajo wasserhövel .
müntefering said that the upset had led him to decide not to run for re-election as the leader of the social democrats .
" i can no longer be party chairman under these conditions , " he told reporters .
critical time the announcement comes at a critical time in the negotiations on forming a left-right coalition government under angela merkel , the cdu leader .
the move could throw into question the timetable for the new government to take office , originally slated for late november .
on nov .
22 , merkel is expected to be voted in as germany 's first female chancellor by the lower house of parliament , two months after her christian democrats narrowly beat current chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in a general election .
schröder has said he will not serve in the grand coalition government . the spd in-fighting came in the midst of coalition talks aimed to create a financial plan for the new government that includes spending cuts and possible tax increases to bring the budget under control .
move weakens talks the power struggle began after müntefering nominated a loyal deputy , wasserhövel , to serve as the social democrats ' secretary general , who is responsible for managing party business and ensuring discipline among its often willful rank-and-file .
but the party leader 's " unilateral " move sparked indignation among some factions , leading the unofficial chief of the party 's left wing , nahles , to declare her own candidacy .
the social democrats were hoping to snuff out the dispute ahead of monday evening 's coalition talks and before a party congress when the secretary general is to be formally elected . although nahles has won some top-level support for her bid , leading party officials said a victory for her would hobble müntefering at a crucial time and expose deep fissures in the party . " i think this approach is pretty scandalous , " the spokesman for the social democrats ' right wing , johannes kahrs , said of nahles . " the party can not afford , in the middle of coalition negotiations , to have our leader weakened .

only 1.1 million tickets for the global soccer showpiece have been put on public sale . corporate tickets finally making it to the fans however , this controversial allocation may yet pay dividends to some lucky supporters .
world cup organizers expect some of the tickets allocated to national associations and the other groups to be returned , and fans can apply for places on the waiting list for those returns between november 2 and november 30 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst r. schmidt of the german world cup organizing committee " anyone who 's taken a flight knows about waiting lists , " said horst r. schmidt , the organizing committee vice president in charge of ticketing , in an interview with reuters .
" if someone fails to fails to show up or hands back their ticket , the person at the top of the waiting list takes their place . " venue not team specific tickets up for grabs while this may open up the possibility of more fans getting their hands on the holy grail of soccer tickets , they will not have any say as to which games they wish to attend .
the draw for the tournament does not take place until december 9 but they will be able to pick out specific venues that interest them . priority for waiting list places will be given to people who made unsuccessful applications for tickets in the first sales phase as well as those who bought team specific tickets for teams which subsequently failed to qualify for the tournament . the 812,000 tickets that were made available to ordinary fans in the first two sales windows were oversubscribed by 10 to one .
an estimated 300,000 further tickets will be up for grabs from december 12 to january 15 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

be it in england , france or spain , the expectations are high and the pressure correspondingly great . if german manager jürgen klinsmann , who came face to face with his critics this week , ever feels like pouring out his heart he could always phone a friend - sven , raymond , or luis would do . klinsmann was a born winner on the pitch but the 1990 world cup hero arguably had one of the toughest challenges of his professional life when he appeared before bundesliga bosses at last week 's showdown to defend his idiosyncratic training methods . klinsmann though is by no means alone in feeling the heat - just ask england 's sven-goran eriksson , raymond domenech of france , or spain 's luis aragones .
all three have to a greater or lesser degree been hauled over the coals as they 've guided their teams through world cup qualifying , criticism raining down despite two of the trio finishing top of their respective groups . if the four managers were to ever form a self-help group to deal with the strains of leadership , klinsmann would undisputedly be in the chair .
for many the 41-year-old golden boy of german soccer has lost some of his shine since his appointment - his first stab at management - as rudi völler 's successor after germany 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign . promising start has turned sour a creditable third to brazil and argentina in the confederations cup gave him breathing space , but the knives have come out in the wake of some pretty moderate performances with friendly losses to slovakia and turkey , a draw with the netherlands and uninspiring wins over south africa and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's uli hoeness has been one of klinsmann 's loudest detractors the main concerns are klinsmann 's refusal to base himself in germany ; his introduction of american-style training programs ; his perceived over-reliance on skipper michael ballack ; and a leaky defense . " klinsmann , why are we so bad ? " asked the bild tabloid bluntly after the istanbul defeat . the welt am sonntag weekly wrote at the time : " the defence played as if they had just seen each other for the first time . " " welcome to germany , where you have nothing to fear from your hosts , " was the caustic headline in the bild am sonntag newspaper and directed at teams from europe , africa and south america after the final round of world cup qualifiers . eriksson knows the feeling last week 's meeting with the country 's top flight managers saw a compromise reached where a group of six senior german soccer officials , including two of klinsmann 's fiercest critics , bayern munich 's uli hoeness and schalke 04 's rudi assauer , will offer the free-spirited former world cup winning striker ' guidance ' .
if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .
the main gripe seems to be his soft approach and he gave his critics short shrift when asked if he could ever win them over . " some of them maybe not .
some of them think i should resign tomorrow , " he said .
" but we have won our group and we have a good team , the best since i came to this country .
i would be an extremely bad manager -lrb- coach -rrb- and a bad professional if i resigned tomorrow .
i have absolutely no intention of doing that whatsoever . " 1998 champs underperforming ? over in paris , domenech 's tenure as france coach has also come under critical scrutiny despite the 1998 champions sealing their passage to germany as winners of their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the world cup group did n't protect france 's raymond domenech from the press " whether france qualifies or not , there has to be a huge question mark over his place in french soccer and his method of management given the performances of the team in qualifying , " was france football magazine 's damning verdict on his reign . yet domenech , booed before the final 4-0 qualifier win over cyprus , can find some comfort from an opinion poll in le journal du dimanche in which 79 percent believed he should carry on in the hot seat . and as for aragones , who was fined last year for racist comments about thierry henry , he has a tense few weeks ahead of him as he prepares spain , constant underachievers on the international stage , for the play-offs . you can almost hear the sound of knives being sharpened up and down the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

restaurants are following suit , removing poultry from their menus . poultry is doing a disappearing act from german kitchens and restaurants , just ahead of the prime poultry season .

be it in england , france or spain , the expectations are high and the pressure correspondingly great . if german manager jürgen klinsmann , who came face to face with his critics this week , ever feels like pouring out his heart he could always phone a friend - sven , raymond , or luis would do . klinsmann was a born winner on the pitch but the 1990 world cup hero arguably had one of the toughest challenges of his professional life when he appeared before bundesliga bosses at last week 's showdown to defend his idiosyncratic training methods . klinsmann though is by no means alone in feeling the heat - just ask england 's sven-goran eriksson , raymond domenech of france , or spain 's luis aragones .
all three have to a greater or lesser degree been hauled over the coals as they 've guided their teams through world cup qualifying , criticism raining down despite two of the trio finishing top of their respective groups . if the four managers were to ever form a self-help group to deal with the strains of leadership , klinsmann would undisputedly be in the chair .
for many the 41-year-old golden boy of german soccer has lost some of his shine since his appointment - his first stab at management - as rudi völler 's successor after germany 's disastrous euro 2004 campaign . promising start has turned sour a creditable third to brazil and argentina in the confederations cup gave him breathing space , but the knives have come out in the wake of some pretty moderate performances with friendly losses to slovakia and turkey , a draw with the netherlands and uninspiring wins over south africa and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's uli hoeness has been one of klinsmann 's loudest detractors the main concerns are klinsmann 's refusal to base himself in germany ; his introduction of american-style training programs ; his perceived over-reliance on skipper michael ballack ; and a leaky defense . " klinsmann , why are we so bad ? " asked the bild tabloid bluntly after the istanbul defeat . the welt am sonntag weekly wrote at the time : " the defence played as if they had just seen each other for the first time . " " welcome to germany , where you have nothing to fear from your hosts , " was the caustic headline in the bild am sonntag newspaper and directed at teams from europe , africa and south america after the final round of world cup qualifiers . eriksson knows the feeling last week 's meeting with the country 's top flight managers saw a compromise reached where a group of six senior german soccer officials , including two of klinsmann 's fiercest critics , bayern munich 's uli hoeness and schalke 04 's rudi assauer , will offer the free-spirited former world cup winning striker ' guidance ' .
if their broadsides in the days leading up to the meeting are any indication of the guidance they will provide , then it could be a bumpy coalition . attacks on eriksson , while not as acute as those directed at klinsmann , must nevertheless bemuse the swede after he 'd safely guided england to the finals as group winners though the ride through the qualifiers was hardly smooth , including a 1-0 loss to northern ireland in belfast .
the main gripe seems to be his soft approach and he gave his critics short shrift when asked if he could ever win them over . " some of them maybe not .
some of them think i should resign tomorrow , " he said .
" but we have won our group and we have a good team , the best since i came to this country .
i would be an extremely bad manager -lrb- coach -rrb- and a bad professional if i resigned tomorrow .
i have absolutely no intention of doing that whatsoever . " 1998 champs underperforming ? over in paris , domenech 's tenure as france coach has also come under critical scrutiny despite the 1998 champions sealing their passage to germany as winners of their group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the world cup group did n't protect france 's raymond domenech from the press " whether france qualifies or not , there has to be a huge question mark over his place in french soccer and his method of management given the performances of the team in qualifying , " was france football magazine 's damning verdict on his reign . yet domenech , booed before the final 4-0 qualifier win over cyprus , can find some comfort from an opinion poll in le journal du dimanche in which 79 percent believed he should carry on in the hot seat . and as for aragones , who was fined last year for racist comments about thierry henry , he has a tense few weeks ahead of him as he prepares spain , constant underachievers on the international stage , for the play-offs . you can almost hear the sound of knives being sharpened up and down the country . dw staff / afp -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

" sommer was instrumental in the bombing of seven synagogues in paris in october 1941 .
but after world war ii , he spent years spying on right-wing politicians for the new regime in east germany , and was later posted to italy where he continued to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis were tried after the war but some were saved by the stasi officially , the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- adopted a resolutely anti-fascist stance and in the years following world war ii its courts condemned more than 8,000 former nazis . the waldheim trial in saxony in 1950 , for example , saw 32 former nazi operatives sentenced to death . nazis blackmailed i n to worki n g for commu n ists but the book claims that high-profile convictions covered up a more cynical reality - instead of serving sentences they were blackmailed into working for the ubiquitous stasi , which had more operatives per member of the population than any other spy network in the communist bloc . " the stasi deliberately and systematically recruited nazi criminals , sometimes those who orchestrated massacres , as informers and agents both in the east and the west , " leide said . josef settnik , a gestapo operative who was based at the infamous auschwitz death camp , was awaiting a death sentence and had already said goodbye to his wife when he was recruited by the stasi in 1964 as a church spy . another case in point is willy läritz who was a member of the gestapo in the eastern city of leipzig who took his spying skills over to the stasi and gained a reputation for " heavy-handed " interrogation methods . he was drafted into the secret police in 1961 " to support our fight for peace and socialism , " according to an entry in his stasi file . läritz was considered vital because he had compromising information about other nazi operatives who were then blackmailed into joining the stasi as well , leide said . stasi recruitme n t a " seco n d cha n ce " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker -lrb- left -rrb- and his communist regime provided a haven the former nazis were told that they would be given a second chance in return for cooperating with the communist regime , which had quickly realized that in some areas they had skills that were hard to find elsewhere . " the presence of some former national socialists in the new state party , the socialist unity party of germany -lrb- sed -rrb- , was really just the tip of the iceberg , " leide writes .
" where qualifications were needed and there was strong competition from the west , they could be found in high concentrations . " if the former nazis showed that they had " adapted " and were loyal to the sed , they could moreover count on senior posts . secret police helped protect nazis from prosecutio n leide , who is part of the committee that manages the stasi archives today and enjoyed special access to its files , said that the secret police not only used the nazis but also protected them from further prosecution , partly in a bid to preserve the image of the regime . this was the case with harald heyns , who was convicted of war crimes in france and britain but managed to hide in the gdr under a false name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the regime feared that nazis in its midst would harm the gdr 's image the authorities deliberately turned a blind eye for fear that if the truth were known , it could " harm the image of the gdr . " while the book reveals that large numbers of nazis spied for the stasi , their presence in other sectors of the communist has been well-documented . " even at the time we knew that people with a nazi past were being drafted into the volksarmee , " the " people 's army " of the gdr , said richard schröder , a philosophy professor at berlin 's humboldt university . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : gdr secret police spied on future pope the east german secret police spied on the man who would become pope benedict xvi for 15 years , targeting him as one of the vatican 's fiercest opponents of communism , according to a report published sunday .

the workers had walked out after they failed to agree the terms of a new , three-year contract .
they will return to work on 1 november after four fifths of the workforce voted to accept an improved offer .
earlier this month , falconbridge agreed to a friendly 12.5bn canadian dollars -lrb- $ 10.6bn ; £ 6bn -rrb- takeover by rival inco .
' made progress ' workers had complained that the initial pay deal did not reflect a surge in commodity prices , and was less than their previous agreement .
as part of the new deal , workers will get a 2 % wage increase in the first year , followed by 2 % in the second and 1 % in the third .
they also will get a cost of living allowance , and a one-off payment of c $ 1,500 .
falconbridge has also agreed to continue with the " present benefit coverage " and use its own workers before contractors .
" the bottom line is that we have made progress in virtually every area of the collective agreement , " said bob chernecki , an official of the canadian auto workers union , which had been representing the strikers .
commodity firms have been enjoying solid times as prices for metals such as copper have been driven to new highs by demand in developing economies like china .
the kidd creek operation in northern ontario produces copper and zinc , and has one of the world 's largest smelting operations .

more than 100 zones , which have signs saying cold callers are not welcome , have been set up since the summer or are in the process of being set up .
now the scheme by the trading standards institute has been given a £ 50,000 grant to extend it across the uk .
some business chiefs are alarmed by the news and say it will put off legitimate firms but not the rogue traders .
avon ladies richard berry , director of the direct selling association , said most direct sellers were women who ran small part time businesses selling the products of long-established companies .
and jerry mcdonald , president of avon uk , where 99 % of salespeople are women , said it was a threat to the business .
he added : " i think this will make them -lsb- " avon ladies " -rsb- feel very uncomfortable and may actually threaten them into believing they are doing something illegal .
that is not the case . "
this scheme helps communities to equip themselves to deter those unwelcome doorstep cold callers ron gainsford tsi chief executive but the trading standards institute -lrb- tsi -rrb- says cold calling has been linked to crimes like burglary .
in the zones , signs are put up telling cold callers they are not welcome , residents are given stickers and often a hotline to call if they are bothered by unwelcome visitors .
the £ 50,000 grant has been donated by bt , which has stopped its own door-to-door selling practices .
the tsi wants new laws to ban cold calling at private addresses for repairs and maintenance .
chief executive ron gainsford said : " in the absence of improvements in the law , this scheme helps communities to equip themselves to deter those unwelcome doorstep cold callers . "

a sub-committee of japan 's food safety commission said imports , which had been halted amid fears of mad-cow disease , could resume as early as december .
the ban has proved controversial and the us threatened retaliatory tariffs .
negotiations have been stepped up ahead of us president george w bush 's visit to japan on 15 and 16 november .
' extremely small ' the ban on us beef was imposed in december 2003 , seven months after halting imports from canada .
at the end of 2004 , it seemed as if a breakthrough had been negotiated when japan agreed to exempt cattle that was younger than 20 months .
imports must be stopped if there is a concern of a risk to humans sub-committee chairman yasuhiro yoshikawa japan attached conditions to the deal and it pretty much stalled , prompting increased frustration among us producers .
before the ban , japan was the biggest importer of us beef .
speaking on monday , the chairman of the committee that looked into the risks related to us beef said that a ban could be lifted as long as dangerous body parts - such as heads and spinal cords - were removed .
" based on the assumption that all precautions are taken as requested , we consider the difference in risk between us and japanese beef to be extremely small , " said committee chairman yasuhiro yoshikawa .
" if the conditions are maintained , the risk is very slim . "
' must be stopped ' however , the lifting of the ban if far from certain .
the sub-committee will now forward their report to the full food safety commission , which is expected to consider it on wednesday .
following that , there will be public hearings and finally the government will be asked to approve or reject any changes to the ban .
while policymakers may be close to reaching an agreement , surveys have shown that the majority of japanese consumers remain very wary of us beef .
mr yoshikawa also urged caution , adding that " imports must be stopped if there is a concern of a risk to humans " .

but for the survivors of the quake-devastated mountain areas in pakistan-administered kashmir , the battle for survival is getting grimmer by the minute .
the hills around the capital city of muzaffarabad are streaming with desperate survivors making their way to the relief camps set up along the badly damaged road winding along river neelum .
many among them have trekked for two to three days to reach the camps , only to find supplies short and aid workers - both from the public and private sector - getting increasingly cynical .
i have seen people fighting with axes over relief goods dropped by helicopters - this is truly the law of the jungle abdur razzak local resident only six kilometres -lrb- four miles -rrb- from muzaffarabad along the road that leads into neelum valley , the determination to rebuild that one sees in the city is replaced by despair and a state of panic over the future .
queues of people stretching for hundreds of metres end at a tent where all they are likely to get is a packet of biscuits and a bottle of water .
for most of those in the line , it is a reward worth the hour-long wait .
impossible routes it is not difficult to understand why .
neelum valley is a 200-km -lrb- 124m -rrb- gorge through which flows river neelum , or kishanganga as it is known in india .
the valley is among the worst-hit areas .
the road that winds along the river is so badly damaged - starting a bare two kilometres -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- outside muzaffarabad - that it has taken army engineers 14 days to repair a four-kilometre -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- stretch .
they have another 196km -lrb- 122 miles -rrb- to go .
an officer from the army engineering corps , irfanullah khan , told the bbc news website that they came there thinking they would have to clear and repair the road .
" instead , what we have discovered is that we may need to rebuild most of it , " he said .
" look what is happening here , " he said pointing to the road ahead .
the army had cleared a part of it - a bulldozer had pushed through - but a huge landslide again blocked the part it had cleared only hours earlier .
unending landslides for as far as the eye can follow this narrow , winding gorge , one can see mountains still crumbling on both sides .
dangers facing survivors send us your comments the unending landslides have reduced entire mountain sides to slopes of gravel and dust - too dangerous to be traversed even on foot .
with winter approaching , there is little hope of the road being cleared in time to get the required relief supplies to people living on the mountains on either side of the river .
the roads and pathways connecting the mountain villages to the main road have been damaged as badly .
surviving villagers are only too aware of the perils that this destruction poses for them .
september-october is traditionally the period when the villagers stock up for the next five months , when most of the mountain routes are completely cut-off by snow .
this year , whatever they had managed to store during september was buried by the quake .
most of october was spent searching for the dead and giving them a decent burial .
it is only this week that they have found time - for the first time since the earthquake - to think about their future .
' wasted ' journey i head for the mountains on the left , hoping to reach a village at the top .
as one goes deeper into the mountains , one is getting closer and closer to the earthquake 's epicentre .
isma bibi lost four male members of the family in the quake all along the narrow , winding and slippery path that has been stamped out by hordes of desperate relief-seekers , one can see a steady stream of people trying to get to the remnants of the road below or going back with whatever they could find .
isma bibi is a widow whose husband was a soldier in the pakistan army .
he was killed at a border post two-and-a-half years ago , leaving behind two children .
the earthquake took away four male members of her family , leaving her alone to fend for herself and the children .
it took her two days to walk the 60km -lrb- 37m -rrb- from her village and all she is carrying on her way back is a plastic bag with five packets of biscuits in it .
" i never realised what a tough journey it was going to be , " she said .
" when i reached a camp , i could have lined up for a sack of flour but i realised that there was no way i could carry it back over the mountains . "
it will take her two more days to get back to her village , where her kids are being looked after by a neighbour .
" the government says relief supplies have reached most areas .
if this was true , why would i be going through this torture ? "
mass graves a gruelling four-hour trek up a 5,000ft-high -lrb- 1,524m -rrb- mountain takes me to the village of butmang .

the elder of the house , abdur razzak , is a driver employed by a company in saudi arabia .
he rushed back when he heard of the earthquake and is now pondering giving up his job to find suitable employment closer to home .

the hills around the capital city of muzaffarabad are streaming with desperate survivors making their way to the relief camps set up along the badly damaged road winding along river neelum .

neelum valley is a 200-km -lrb- 124m -rrb- gorge through which flows river neelum , or kishanganga as it is known in india .
the valley is among the worst-hit areas .
the road that winds along the river is so badly damaged - starting a bare two kilometres -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- outside muzaffarabad - that it has taken army engineers 14 days to repair a four-kilometre -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- stretch .
they have another 196km -lrb- 122 miles -rrb- to go .
an officer from the army engineering corps , irfanullah khan , told the bbc news website that they came there thinking they would have to clear and repair the road .
" instead , what we have discovered is that we may need to rebuild most of it , " he said .
" look what is happening here , " he said pointing to the road ahead .
the army had cleared a part of it - a bulldozer had pushed through - but a huge landslide again blocked the part it had cleared only hours earlier .
unending landslides for as far as the eye can follow this narrow , winding gorge , one can see mountains still crumbling on both sides .

with winter approaching , there is little hope of the road being cleared in time to get the required relief supplies to people living on the mountains on either side of the river .
the roads and pathways connecting the mountain villages to the main road have been damaged as badly .
surviving villagers are only too aware of the perils that this destruction poses for them .
september-october is traditionally the period when the villagers stock up for the next five months , when most of the mountain routes are completely cut-off by snow .
this year , whatever they had managed to store during september was buried by the quake .
most of october was spent searching for the dead and giving them a decent burial .

forensic biologist carmen eckhoff told the darwin court that she had used a converted office in a police station .
bradley murdoch , 47 , of broome , western australia , denies killing the uk backpacker who disappeared after an alleged ambush in the outback in 2001 .
he also denies the assault and kidnap of his girlfriend joanne lees , now 32 . "
the facilities in the old police headquarters were inadequate to meet the standards from a health and safety point of view " carmen eckhoff forensic biologist mr murdoch is accused of shooting dead 28-year-old mr falconio and disposing of his body after flagging down his kombi van on a remote road near alice springs on 14 july 2001 .
the body of mr falconio , from huddersfield , has never been found .
carmen eckhoff , who works for the northern territory police , fire and emergency services , said the make-shift lab she used was on the first floor of the police centre in berrimah .
she told the court the australian national association of testing authorities -lrb- nata -rrb- had not accredited it because of health and safety concerns - rather than due to concerns about the scientific procedures being carried out there .
these included the lack of a second exit , safety showers and eye washes which would not have affected the results , she added .
" the facilities in the old police headquarters were inadequate to meet the standards from a health and safety point of view but the scientific practices were in place from the 1990s , " she said .
' less than ideal ' several of the tests carried out in this old laboratory were " separated by time " because they could not be separated by space , she said .
this was a recognised scientific method to help minimise contamination , she added .
however , when questioned by anthony elliott , prosecuting , ms eckhoff acknowledged the conditions were " less than ideal " .
the forensic team moved to a new laboratory in berrimah in october 2001 , three months after the alleged attack .
on friday the court heard how the handcuffs allegedly used to hold miss lees , now living in brighton , were put in the same room as mr murdoch 's property .
miss lees told police she was threatened with a gun to her head , tied up with her hands behind her back and put into the back of her attacker 's vehicle .
she says she managed to escape from under the loose canopy and had hid in the bush for more than five hours before being rescued .
the court also heard evidence that mr falconio could have died from a single gun shot , despite the fact that no bullets , brain matter or body parts were found at the scene . "
the bullet can ricochet around inside the skull and then lodge in a thicker part of the skull . "
dr noel woodford forensic pathologist forensic pathologist dr noel woodford told the court that most gunshot wounds from a .22 calibre revolver do not result in exit wounds .
" the bullet can ricochet around inside the skull and then lodge in a thicker part of the skull .

forensic biologist carmen eckhoff told the darwin court that she had used a converted office in a police station .
bradley murdoch , 47 , of broome , western australia , denies killing the uk backpacker who disappeared after an alleged ambush in the outback in 2001 .
he also denies the assault and kidnap of his girlfriend joanne lees , now 32 .
the facilities in the old police headquarters were inadequate to meet the standards from a health and safety point of view carmen eckhoff forensic biologist mr murdoch is accused of shooting dead 28-year-old mr falconio and disposing of his body after flagging down his kombi van on a remote road near alice springs on 14 july 2001 .
the body of mr falconio , from huddersfield , has never been found .
carmen eckhoff , who works for the northern territory police , fire and emergency services , said the make-shift lab she used was on the first floor of the police centre in berrimah .
she told the court the australian national association of testing authorities -lrb- nata -rrb- had not accredited it because of health and safety concerns - rather than due to concerns about the scientific procedures being carried out there .
these included the lack of a second exit , safety showers and eye washes which would not have affected the results , she added .
" the facilities in the old police headquarters were inadequate to meet the standards from a health and safety point of view but the scientific practices were in place from the 1990s , " she said .
' less than ideal ' several of the tests carried out in this old laboratory were " separated by time " because they could not be separated by space , she said .
this was a recognised scientific method to help minimise contamination , she added .
however , when questioned by anthony elliott , prosecuting , ms eckhoff acknowledged the conditions were " less than ideal " .
the forensic team moved to a new laboratory in berrimah in october 2001 , three months after the alleged attack .
the court has heard how officers failed to thoroughly search the scene on friday the court heard how the handcuffs allegedly used to hold miss lees , now living in brighton , were put in the same room as mr murdoch 's property .
miss lees told police she was threatened with a gun to her head , tied up with her hands behind her back and put into the back of her attacker 's vehicle .
she says she managed to escape from under the loose canopy and had hid in the bush for more than five hours before being rescued .
the court also heard evidence that mr falconio could have died from a single gun shot , despite the fact that no bullets , brain matter or body parts were found at the scene .
the bullet can ricochet around inside the skull and then lodge in a thicker part of the skull .

she remains one of uk music 's most important -and influential - female artists .
in 1978 , with british music still reeling from punk , a doctor 's daughter from the south london suburb of bexleyheath released her debut single wuthering heights , a song inspired by the emily bronte novel .
the eerie song could have been derided as an out-of-date progressive oddity .
but wuthering heights was a haunting treasure .
few could believe a 19-year-old had penned it .
but this odd song topped the charts and a british musical legend was born .
bush 's first album , the kick inside , was recorded soon after wuthering heights ' success and sold more than a million copies when it was released .
both her debut and the follow-up album lionheart , released the same year , featured songs bush had written in her early teens , including the man with the child in his eyes .
allowed time bush had been discovered by a friend of the family , ricky hopper , and a demo recorded when she was only 15 made its way to pink floyd guitarist david gilmour when she was 16 .
he insisted she be signed to emi .
bush drew upon mime and modern dance for her live shows in stark contrast to the hot-housing approach of record companies in 2005 , emi insisted she be allowed to develop at her own pace .
as part of the process she studied mime and dance as well as singing .
she released five albums by 1985 , the last of which , hounds of love , is cited as an influence by other artists such as pj harvey , alanis morissette , tori amos and even 21st century rock bands such as the futureheads .
her last album , the red shoes , was the first to debut in the us top 30 in 1993 .
since then , her career has not so much waned , as been turned off at will .
bush remains one of the music industry 's most reclusive artists .
she has toured only once , in 1979 .
embraces motherhood she now records mostly at her home studio in berkshire and prefers to lead a quiet , family-orientated life .
" i suppose i do think i go out of my way to be a very normal person and i just find it frustrating that people think that i 'm some kind of weirdo reclusive that never comes out into the world , " she told an interviewer recently .
bush appeared on delia smith 's cookery show in 1979 in 1998 , she became a mother for the first time at the age of 41 , giving birth to a son , bertie , who is apparently a major influence on the new record .
music week 's a & r editor stuart clarke said bush remains a major figure in the british music industry .
" it 's not like some artists who have a 12-year break and people forget about them .
this is more than a break .
there is this mystery and fascination there about what she has been doing , " he said .
remains elusive mr clarke added that bush 's " fanatical " fanbase is another part of the equation .
" in many ways she seems closer to them than she does to the music business or her manager , " he explained .
bbc 6 music reporter mark sutherland said : " even after more than 20 years we really do n't know much about her .
bush 's single wuthering heights regularly makes all-time great lists " she is pretty much the only artist who could go 12 years between a record and people would still be interested .
" you 're guaranteed to hear something incredibly interesting . "
sutherland said part of the delay in releasing music may be because she is a perfectionist - and with her own studio to record in , she can work to her own timetable .
major influence " i get the feeling that making records is n't something she necessarily wants to do , but has to do . "
new artists continue to state her importance .
" at the mercury prize , pretty much the first thing the winner antony of antony and the johnsons said was the first artist he obsessed about was kate bush , " mr sutherland said .
" she attracted people who were different .
before kate bush , these people could n't imagine being on top of the pops .

she remains one of uk music 's most important -and influential - female artists .
in 1978 , with british music still reeling from punk , a doctor 's daughter from the south london suburb of bexleyheath released her debut single wuthering heights , a song inspired by the emily bronte novel .
the eerie song could have been derided as an out-of-date progressive oddity .
but wuthering heights was a haunting treasure .
few could believe a 19-year-old had penned it .
but this odd song topped the charts and a british musical legend was born .
bush 's first album , the kick inside , was recorded soon after wuthering heights ' success and sold more than a million copies when it was released .
both her debut and the follow-up album lionheart , released the same year , featured songs bush had written in her early teens , including the man with the child in his eyes .
allowed time bush had been discovered by a friend of the family , ricky hopper , and a demo recorded when she was only 15 made its way to pink floyd guitarist david gilmour when she was 16 .
he insisted she be signed to emi .
bush drew upon mime and modern dance for her live shows in stark contrast to the hot-housing approach of record companies in 2005 , emi insisted she be allowed to develop at her own pace .
as part of the process she studied mime and dance as well as singing .
she released five albums by 1985 , the last of which , hounds of love , is cited as an influence by other artists such as pj harvey , alanis morissette , tori amos and even 21st century rock bands such as the futureheads .
her last album , the red shoes , was the first to debut in the us top 30 in 1993 .
since then , her career has not so much waned , as been turned off at will .
bush remains one of the music industry 's most reclusive artists .
she has toured only once , in 1979 .
embraces motherhood she now records mostly at her home studio in berkshire and prefers to lead a quiet , family-orientated life .
" i suppose i do think i go out of my way to be a very normal person and i just find it frustrating that people think that i 'm some kind of weirdo reclusive that never comes out into the world , " she told an interviewer recently .
bush appeared on delia smith 's cookery show in 1979 in 1998 , she became a mother for the first time at the age of 41 , giving birth to a son , bertie , who is apparently a major influence on the new record .
music week 's a & r editor stuart clarke said bush remains a major figure in the british music industry .
" it 's not like some artists who have a 12-year break and people forget about them .
this is more than a break .
there is this mystery and fascination there about what she has been doing , " he said .
remains elusive mr clarke added that bush 's " fanatical " fanbase is another part of the equation .
" in many ways she seems closer to them than she does to the music business or her manager , " he explained .
bbc 6 music reporter mark sutherland said : " even after more than 20 years we really do n't know much about her .
bush 's single wuthering heights regularly makes all-time great lists " she is pretty much the only artist who could go 12 years between a record and people would still be interested .
" you 're guaranteed to hear something incredibly interesting . "
sutherland said part of the delay in releasing music may be because she is a perfectionist - and with her own studio to record in , she can work to her own timetable .
major influence " i get the feeling that making records is n't something she necessarily wants to do , but has to do . "
new artists continue to state her importance .
" at the mercury prize , pretty much the first thing the winner antony of antony and the johnsons said was the first artist he obsessed about was kate bush , " mr sutherland said .
" she attracted people who were different .
before kate bush , these people could n't imagine being on top of the pops .
" after seeing her , they realised they could make music themselves . "

home invasion the watchdog program , called the warden by blizzard , has been known about among players for some time .
it makes sure that players are not using cheat software which can , for example , automatically play the game and build up a character 's qualities .
however , knowledge of it crossed to the mainstream thanks to software engineer greg hoglund who disassembled the code of the warden and watched it in action to get a better idea of what it did .

plaid cymru currently refuses to nominate peers because it wants a fully elected house of lords .
but meirionnydd nant conwy mp mr llwyd said the party was failing to make its voice heard in debates affecting wales .
he said plaid 's two other mps supported him , but that policy change could only come at the annual conference .
the only party member to sit as a peer , dafydd elis-thomas , was made a lord in 1992 following a personal decision which proved controversial . "
we are not able to represent our country as well as we might without somebody in the second chamber " elfyn llwyd mp but mr llwyd told bbc radio wales that the party 's official policy must change if its voice is to be heard in the house of lords .
" it 's a personal u-turn .
ten years ago we debated this and i was certainly against the idea , " he said .
" but i 've been working in westminster for the last 13 to 14 years and i 've realised that we are not able to represent our country as well as we might without somebody in the second chamber . "
mr llwyd said that plaid cymru needed to ensure that there were people who would " speak up for wales " in parliamentary measures relating to wales passed by the house of lords .
the policy can not be changed until the party 's annual conference in september , but mr llwyd said it was important to raise the issue now .
" i want a full mature sensible debate between now and then , none of this flummery about people in ermine once a year , " he said .
" we would like a fully democratic , fully elected chamber , but i do n't think there is a great deal of impetus for that to happen just now and i do n't think we can afford to wait for it to happen . "
he also said the change in policy was for the good of the party and did not represent a personal ambition for a peerage .
" that 's certainly not on my horizon at all at the moment and frankly it 's got nothing to do with my decision at all , " he said .
