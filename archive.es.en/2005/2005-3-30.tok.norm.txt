several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .

the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .

" anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .

" it 's very important ... that the senior management of the bank reflect the fact that it is a multilateral institution , " wolfowitz said , when asked if he would appoint a european as vice-president . " it needs to reflect the fact that the european countries as a group are the largest single donors to the bank ...
but it also needs to reflect the full diversity of donors and recipients , " he said . european commission satisfied the european commission , the eu 's executive , expressed satisfaction with the assurances from wolfowitz . the european commission was " satisfied with ...
mr. wolfowitz , his assurances on development policy , more specifically on trade issues and poverty reduction , " a spokeswoman said . the nomination of wolfowitz sparked widespread criticism because of his lack of development experience and because of his role in organizing the iraq war . germany hopes for new beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said europe was not focusing on wolfowitz 's involvement in the iraq war but rather on his views on development . " this is for him a new beginning and we 'll judge him according to what he said today at the discussions , " she said . but belgian development minister armand de decker hinted at lingering concerns . " what worries us a bit is that he is always talking about economic development , " he said .
" what does he mean by economic development ?
development is economic but it is not only economic .
so there are some things that need to be cleared up . " eu stresses millenium development goals at an eu summit last week , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the bank , which focuses on long-term development projects and support for developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.9 billion euro -rrb- annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , said the europeans wanted the meeting with wolfowitz " to make sure the millenium development goals are the basis on which the incoming president of world bank organizes his work . " the united nation 's so-called millenium development goals , set in september 2000 , aim to slash global poverty in half by 2015 , step up the fight against diseases such as aids and tuberculosis , and increase access to education . french deputy ? the europeans want to get a candidate of their own at the world bank to act as wolfowitz 's deputy , diplomats said tuesday . the french have put forward two names : jean-pierre jouyet , head of the paris club of creditor nations , and jean-pierre landau , who has written a report for french president jacques chirac about the feasibility of an international tax to finance development . paris also wants another deputy to wolfowitz from a developing country .

" the united nation 's so-called millenium development goals , set in september 2000 , aim to slash global poverty in half by 2015 , step up the fight against diseases such as aids and tuberculosis , and increase access to education . french deputy ? the europeans want to get a candidate of their own at the world bank to act as wolfowitz 's deputy , diplomats said tuesday . the french have put forward two names : jean-pierre jouyet , head of the paris club of creditor nations , and jean-pierre landau , who has written a report for french president jacques chirac about the feasibility of an international tax to finance development . paris also wants another deputy to wolfowitz from a developing country .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans europe -pipe- 30.03.2005 opinion : the pope continues to provoke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the catholic church 's leader is still in charge in a dramatic display , the fatally ill pope silently delivered the " urbi et orbi " easter blessing on sunday .
the appearance raises a question : why does the vatican want the world to share in john paul ii 's suffering ? for years journalists have published stories entitled " twilight of the gods in the vatican " about the late - or rather final - phase of this papacy .
this phase certainly reached a new level in recent weeks .
in an act of extreme exertion , the clearly suffering 84-year old showed himself at a window on easter sunday - the pope delivered his blessing silently . the vatican is keeping mum on whether the pope 's inability to speak is only a temporary result of his throat operation or a permanent feature of his illness .
in the same vein , the curia too has been tightlipped in its information policy over the last few weeks .
details about the pope 's health were only apportioned bit by bit , which , one the one hand fanned speculation , and , on the other , guaranteed public attention . the images from easter have again raised the same old questions .
do the media really have to transport the pope 's suffering into our living rooms ?
does he have to fight his affliction to the very end before the eyes of the world ?
what the one camp views as unbearable cheek , elicits admiration from the other side .
now , the images of the pope stem from vatican television , not from voyeuristic private broadcasters .
a last message for the world john paul ii has always used the media for his own purposes .
his television presence in recent weeks is exactly what he wants .
he 's not being used by the media .
instead , he 's using the cameras to ensure that his final message reaches people : that illness , pain and suffering are part of human nature .
it 's a message that diametrically opposes today 's zeitgeist , and with which he holds up a mirror for mainly western societies that repress old age and death .
up to the very end , john paul ii is a pope of provocation - bowed by age , but unbowed in his cause . debates about whether he will resign , which have again surfaced in the media , are futile .
he himself has consistently ruled out such a move .
jesus christ 's deputy does n't just hand in his resignation ; after all , jesus did n't climb down from his cross .
too late to resign ? in recent years , high-level cardinals have n't ruled out the possibility that john paul ii would resign if he was unable to lead the church .
meanwhile , insiders believe the time for such a step has come and gone .

for , when a pope dies or resigns , all important cardinals at the highest echelons of the vatican 's various departments and business ventures lose their positions . as long as john paul ii can express his wishes , even if he can only do so through gestures , the vatican 's business will continue as before .
but that does n't mean nothing will change .
the pope will increasingly retire from the public eye , which will present the vatican 's directors with an entirely new challenge . carola hossfeld -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope delivers silent easter blessing instead of greeting rome and the world in some 60 languages , pope john paul ii was forced to deliver his traditional " urbi et orbi " easter blessing silently , by making the sign of the cross .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2005 court rejects east german land claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern german mansions were dispossessed after 1945 the european court of human rights has ruled against compensation claims by east germans , who had their land seized after 1945 .
the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .
" anyone claiming something else today is not telling the truth . " he added that a return of the land would upset eastern germany 's new agricultural infrastructure that was painstakingly rebuilt after reunification . disowned farmers have been able to buy back their land , a step taken by von herder .
he paid one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for his family 's estate . bernd grässler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal .

it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other cancer-causing pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures , such as driving bans , if the pollution levels are too high . while most carmakers had said last year they would include filters by 2008 or 2009 , most major producers have now pushed the date forward : according to munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung , mercedes-benz diesel cars will come with the filter by the summer .
bmw has also announced that customers will be able to order their cars with filters in a few months , although they still have to pay extra for them in smaller models .
while audi and volkswagen will also charge for filters , ford still has n't announced their plans , the paper reported .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .

the appearance raises a question : why does the vatican want the world to share in john paul ii 's suffering ? for years journalists have published stories entitled " twilight of the gods in the vatican " about the late - or rather final - phase of this papacy .
this phase certainly reached a new level in recent weeks .
in an act of extreme exertion , the clearly suffering 84-year old showed himself at a window on easter sunday - the pope delivered his blessing silently . the vatican is keeping mum on whether the pope 's inability to speak is only a temporary result of his throat operation or a permanent feature of his illness .
in the same vein , the curia too has been tightlipped in its information policy over the last few weeks .
details about the pope 's health were only apportioned bit by bit , which , one the one hand fanned speculation , and , on the other , guaranteed public attention . the images from easter have again raised the same old questions .
do the media really have to transport the pope 's suffering into our living rooms ?
does he have to fight his affliction to the very end before the eyes of the world ?
what the one camp views as unbearable cheek , elicits admiration from the other side .
now , the images of the pope stem from vatican television , not from voyeuristic private broadcasters .
a last message for the world john paul ii has always used the media for his own purposes .
his television presence in recent weeks is exactly what he wants .
he 's not being used by the media .
instead , he 's using the cameras to ensure that his final message reaches people : that illness , pain and suffering are part of human nature .
it 's a message that diametrically opposes today 's zeitgeist , and with which he holds up a mirror for mainly western societies that repress old age and death .
up to the very end , john paul ii is a pope of provocation - bowed by age , but unbowed in his cause . debates about whether he will resign , which have again surfaced in the media , are futile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.03.2005 germany prepares to welcome the world germany , as a country of kaiser 's and kingdoms , has a rich and ancient history which left an indelible mark on the landscape .
the main cities have retained many of their former glories that hark back to noble times , cultural explosions and historical upheavel .
many of the cities , as centers of power and important locations in the economy , suffered heavily during the many wars that were waged within germany 's borders throughout history .
but reconstruction has created modern metropoles in the place of ruins ; cities with cosmopolitan attitudes which embrace the old while presenting the new to welcome guests .
visitors to the world cup in 2006 may be in germany to cheer on their team or revel in the carnival atmosphere but between matches and raised biersteins , many will discover a different side to their host country .
here dw-world presents a series of profiles detailing each of the 12 world cup host cities . dw-world.de berlin the german capital has as diverse a history as any city in the world .
it has experienced affluence , poverty , destruction and rebirth .
wherever they come from , berlin holds a special place in the heart of most germans .
cologne cologne offers everything from roman remains to raucous clowns .
while the city 's history features many somber moments , modern cologne never needs an excuse to party .
dortmund once a thriving mining city , dortmund reinvented itself as a center for information technology after the war .
also famous for its beer and its soccer team , dortmund is a high profile city in the north-west of germany .
frankfurt the birthplace of goethe and the location for the first german parliament , frankfurt is a historically and culturally rich city .
as europe 's center for banking it is also a rich city in the literal sense of the word .
gelsenkirchen gelsenkirchen has transformed itself from a small town of coal mines and steel industries into a center of modern technology .
hamburg two and half times bigger than london , with one of europe 's biggest ports , hamburg - the venice of the north - offers everything and anything .
hanover hanover is known in germany as the trade fair capital , a reputation which is continues to spread globally .
but hanover has more to offer than just the opportunity to view the latest gadgets at cebit .
kaiserslautern kaiserslautern , a city with a history of more than 800 years spanning many conflicts and occupations , mixes the ancient and modern in a well-earned peaceful atmosphere .

the survey carried out by pollster infratest dimap for german daily die welt , polled a 1,000 unemployed germans .
the majority - 63 percent - said they saw no reason to change their city to look for a job .
according to the survey , 45 percent said they were ready to accept commuting hours of several hours for a new job while 54 percent were against it .
the pessimism continued in their attitudes towards the political situation with 66 percent believing that right-wing parties would gain more support if the present woes in the labor market persisted .
43 percent said that a crucial reason for the high unemployment was foreigners who took away jobs .
the survey also found that 43 percent rated their chances of getting a job as very low , another 29 percent as low - this despite the fact that every second jobless person claimed that he was trying hard to get a new job . dw-world.de nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .

12 . the price of shares in lse fell by 5.27 percent to 449 pence -lrb- 6.5 euros , $ 8.44 -rrb- in immediate response to the referral .
lse shares later stood at 452 pence in late afternoon trading , while deutsche börse fell by 0.72 percent to 59.14 euros and euronext tumbled 2.15 percent to 27.30 euros . " the oft today referred to the competition commission the anticipated acquisitions of the london stock exchange by deutsche börse and by euronext respectively , " the watchdog said in a statement following a two-month review . merger harming competition ? oft chairman john vickers said the proposed bids for the lse came at a time of emerging competition in equities trading between the lse , deutsche börse and euronext . " although such competition has so far been episodic , it needs to be investigated whether either merger would lessen future competition in equities trading in the uk , " vickers added .
" the competition commission will also want to consider the effects of the mergers on competition in clearing services , particularly with the deutsche börse bid . " the commission must complete its inquiry within 24 weeks , although it can apply for an eight-week extension should unforeseen complications arise .
any future formal bids for the lse would not be allowed to proceed before the commission ruled on the competition issues outlined by the oft . börse keeps options open deutsche börse made an offer at the end of january for 530 pence per share or just under two billion euros for the lse .
however , it withdrew the proposal on march 6 in the face of fierce resistance from london and stiff pressure from its own shareholders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange critics fear that a tie-up with frankfurt , which has its clearing and settlement operations under one roof , would have led to higher prices for lse users in trading , clearing and settlement . the german exchange has reserved the right to make a renewed offer should paris-based euronext turn an informal offer into a formal bid . euronext , operator of the exchanges in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon , meanwhile sees synergies worth 203 million euros from a merger . that amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of 100 million euros from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . lse open for discussions responding to the oft 's announcement , the lse said it was willing to continue discussions with potential bidders " about the possibility of an offer that fully values the london stock exchange and is capable of being recommended . " it added in a statement : " the board of the london stock exchange believes in the company 's strong growth prospects as the largest equity market in europe , but maintains that stock exchange consolidation , on the right terms , could be in the best interests of customers and shareholders . " euronext cooperative euronext meanwhile said that it would " work closely " with the commission and claimed that its takeover proposal would work to the advantage of lse customers and shareholders .

12 . the price of shares in lse fell by 5.27 percent to 449 pence -lrb- 6.5 euros , $ 8.44 -rrb- in immediate response to the referral .
lse shares later stood at 452 pence in late afternoon trading , while deutsche börse fell by 0.72 percent to 59.14 euros and euronext tumbled 2.15 percent to 27.30 euros . " the oft today referred to the competition commission the anticipated acquisitions of the london stock exchange by deutsche börse and by euronext respectively , " the watchdog said in a statement following a two-month review . merger harming competition ? oft chairman john vickers said the proposed bids for the lse came at a time of emerging competition in equities trading between the lse , deutsche börse and euronext . " although such competition has so far been episodic , it needs to be investigated whether either merger would lessen future competition in equities trading in the uk , " vickers added .
" the competition commission will also want to consider the effects of the mergers on competition in clearing services , particularly with the deutsche börse bid . " the commission must complete its inquiry within 24 weeks , although it can apply for an eight-week extension should unforeseen complications arise .
any future formal bids for the lse would not be allowed to proceed before the commission ruled on the competition issues outlined by the oft . börse keeps options open deutsche börse made an offer at the end of january for 530 pence per share or just under two billion euros for the lse .
however , it withdrew the proposal on march 6 in the face of fierce resistance from london and stiff pressure from its own shareholders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange critics fear that a tie-up with frankfurt , which has its clearing and settlement operations under one roof , would have led to higher prices for lse users in trading , clearing and settlement . the german exchange has reserved the right to make a renewed offer should paris-based euronext turn an informal offer into a formal bid . euronext , operator of the exchanges in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon , meanwhile sees synergies worth 203 million euros from a merger . that amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of 100 million euros from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . lse open for discussions responding to the oft 's announcement , the lse said it was willing to continue discussions with potential bidders " about the possibility of an offer that fully values the london stock exchange and is capable of being recommended . " it added in a statement : " the board of the london stock exchange believes in the company 's strong growth prospects as the largest equity market in europe , but maintains that stock exchange consolidation , on the right terms , could be in the best interests of customers and shareholders . " euronext cooperative euronext meanwhile said that it would " work closely " with the commission and claimed that its takeover proposal would work to the advantage of lse customers and shareholders . " euronext is convinced that it is the natural partner for london stock exchange , and that a combination of euronext and lse would benefit users and create significant value for shareholders in both companies , " the company added . euronext , registered in the netherlands , has meanwhile said that the lse would remain a british exchange regulated solely by the british regulatory body , the financial services authority , if the two companies did a deal . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse announces share buy-back german stock exchange operator deutsche börse said late tuesday it was planning to launch a share buy-back .

the appearance raises a question : why does the vatican want the world to share in john paul ii 's suffering ? for years journalists have published stories entitled " twilight of the gods in the vatican " about the late - or rather final - phase of this papacy .
this phase certainly reached a new level in recent weeks .
in an act of extreme exertion , the clearly suffering 84-year old showed himself at a window on easter sunday - the pope delivered his blessing silently . the vatican is keeping mum on whether the pope 's inability to speak is only a temporary result of his throat operation or a permanent feature of his illness .
in the same vein , the curia too has been tightlipped in its information policy over the last few weeks .
details about the pope 's health were only apportioned bit by bit , which , one the one hand fanned speculation , and , on the other , guaranteed public attention . the images from easter have again raised the same old questions .
do the media really have to transport the pope 's suffering into our living rooms ?
does he have to fight his affliction to the very end before the eyes of the world ?
what the one camp views as unbearable cheek , elicits admiration from the other side .
now , the images of the pope stem from vatican television , not from voyeuristic private broadcasters .
a last message for the world john paul ii has always used the media for his own purposes .
his television presence in recent weeks is exactly what he wants .
he 's not being used by the media .
instead , he 's using the cameras to ensure that his final message reaches people : that illness , pain and suffering are part of human nature .
it 's a message that diametrically opposes today 's zeitgeist , and with which he holds up a mirror for mainly western societies that repress old age and death .
up to the very end , john paul ii is a pope of provocation - bowed by age , but unbowed in his cause . debates about whether he will resign , which have again surfaced in the media , are futile .
he himself has consistently ruled out such a move .
jesus christ 's deputy does n't just hand in his resignation ; after all , jesus did n't climb down from his cross .
too late to resign ? in recent years , high-level cardinals have n't ruled out the possibility that john paul ii would resign if he was unable to lead the church .
meanwhile , insiders believe the time for such a step has come and gone .
besides , it would likely be confronted by resistance from the vatican leadership 's hard core .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .

" it 's very important ... that the senior management of the bank reflect the fact that it is a multilateral institution , " wolfowitz said , when asked if he would appoint a european as vice-president . " it needs to reflect the fact that the european countries as a group are the largest single donors to the bank ...
but it also needs to reflect the full diversity of donors and recipients , " he said . european commission satisfied the european commission , the eu 's executive , expressed satisfaction with the assurances from wolfowitz . the european commission was " satisfied with ...
mr. wolfowitz , his assurances on development policy , more specifically on trade issues and poverty reduction , " a spokeswoman said . the nomination of wolfowitz sparked widespread criticism because of his lack of development experience and because of his role in organizing the iraq war . germany hopes for new beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said europe was not focusing on wolfowitz 's involvement in the iraq war but rather on his views on development . " this is for him a new beginning and we 'll judge him according to what he said today at the discussions , " she said . but belgian development minister armand de decker hinted at lingering concerns .

" it 's very important ... that the senior management of the bank reflect the fact that it is a multilateral institution , " wolfowitz said , when asked if he would appoint a european as vice-president . " it needs to reflect the fact that the european countries as a group are the largest single donors to the bank ...
but it also needs to reflect the full diversity of donors and recipients , " he said . european commission satisfied the european commission , the eu 's executive , expressed satisfaction with the assurances from wolfowitz . the european commission was " satisfied with ...
mr. wolfowitz , his assurances on development policy , more specifically on trade issues and poverty reduction , " a spokeswoman said . the nomination of wolfowitz sparked widespread criticism because of his lack of development experience and because of his role in organizing the iraq war . germany hopes for new beginning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for cooperation and development heidemarie wieczorek-zeul german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said europe was not focusing on wolfowitz 's involvement in the iraq war but rather on his views on development . " this is for him a new beginning and we 'll judge him according to what he said today at the discussions , " she said . but belgian development minister armand de decker hinted at lingering concerns . " what worries us a bit is that he is always talking about economic development , " he said .
" what does he mean by economic development ?
development is economic but it is not only economic .
so there are some things that need to be cleared up . " eu stresses millenium development goals at an eu summit last week , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the bank , which focuses on long-term development projects and support for developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as president of the world bank , wolfowitz would lead 10,000 staff in washington and around the world , overseeing a $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.9 billion euro -rrb- annual aid budget which for many poor countries is a development lifeline . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who holds the eu 's presidency , said the europeans wanted the meeting with wolfowitz " to make sure the millenium development goals are the basis on which the incoming president of world bank organizes his work . " the united nation 's so-called millenium development goals , set in september 2000 , aim to slash global poverty in half by 2015 , step up the fight against diseases such as aids and tuberculosis , and increase access to education . french deputy ? the europeans want to get a candidate of their own at the world bank to act as wolfowitz 's deputy , diplomats said tuesday . the french have put forward two names : jean-pierre jouyet , head of the paris club of creditor nations , and jean-pierre landau , who has written a report for french president jacques chirac about the feasibility of an international tax to finance development . paris also wants another deputy to wolfowitz from a developing country .
the current number two at the bank is shengman zhang of china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world bank president james wolfensohn traditionally , europe chooses the managing director of the imf and the united states appoints the head of the world bank .
the informal rule has never been broken since the two institutions were set up in the wake of world war ii .
outgoing world bank chief james wolfensohn , 71 , is due to step down in june after a decade in office . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks more clout at world bank a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .
" anyone claiming something else today is not telling the truth . " he added that a return of the land would upset eastern germany 's new agricultural infrastructure that was painstakingly rebuilt after reunification . disowned farmers have been able to buy back their land , a step taken by von herder .
he paid one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for his family 's estate . bernd grässler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2005 court rejects east german land claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many eastern german mansions were dispossessed after 1945 the european court of human rights has ruled against compensation claims by east germans , who had their land seized after 1945 .
the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .

the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .

" anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .

organizers said the run for the much sought-after tickets goes beyond the scope of all such events to date .
" we 're exceptionally pleased at the high level of demand .
it 's further proof of the widespread passion for the world cup in germany , " said the committee 's senior vice president , horst schmidt .
" we 're equally delighted there have been no technical problems .
the internet has proven to be an outstanding sales channel . "
still hope for fans soccer fans have until thursday at midnight cet to place their orders on the web site www.fifaworldcup.com.
more than five million visitors from 191 countries have ordered tickets , organizers said .

" but it was already clear before tickets went on sale that there would be more orders than tickets , " schmidt added .
he said the demand would increase continuously right until the last minute .

" the united nation 's so-called millenium development goals , set in september 2000 , aim to slash global poverty in half by 2015 , step up the fight against diseases such as aids and tuberculosis , and increase access to education . french deputy ? the europeans want to get a candidate of their own at the world bank to act as wolfowitz 's deputy , diplomats said tuesday . the french have put forward two names : jean-pierre jouyet , head of the paris club of creditor nations , and jean-pierre landau , who has written a report for french president jacques chirac about the feasibility of an international tax to finance development . paris also wants another deputy to wolfowitz from a developing country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2005 former diplomats turn against fischer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was joschka fischer really kept in the dark ?
several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .
as one german newspaper commentator put it : " rebellious diplomats are as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.03.2005 former diplomats turn against fischer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was joschka fischer really kept in the dark ?
several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .
as one german newspaper commentator put it : " rebellious diplomats are as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .
as one german newspaper commentator put it : " rebellious diplomats are as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .
" anyone claiming something else today is not telling the truth . " he added that a return of the land would upset eastern germany 's new agricultural infrastructure that was painstakingly rebuilt after reunification . disowned farmers have been able to buy back their land , a step taken by von herder .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .
" anyone claiming something else today is not telling the truth . " he added that a return of the land would upset eastern germany 's new agricultural infrastructure that was painstakingly rebuilt after reunification . disowned farmers have been able to buy back their land , a step taken by von herder .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .

the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .

" anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .
the diplomats ' attacks are said to be unique in the history of german diplomacy .
as one german newspaper commentator put it : " rebellious diplomats are as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .

" it 's very important ... that the senior management of the bank reflect the fact that it is a multilateral institution , " wolfowitz said , when asked if he would appoint a european as vice-president .

" the united nation 's so-called millenium development goals , set in september 2000 , aim to slash global poverty in half by 2015 , step up the fight against diseases such as aids and tuberculosis , and increase access to education . french deputy ? the europeans want to get a candidate of their own at the world bank to act as wolfowitz 's deputy , diplomats said tuesday . the french have put forward two names : jean-pierre jouyet , head of the paris club of creditor nations , and jean-pierre landau , who has written a report for french president jacques chirac about the feasibility of an international tax to finance development . paris also wants another deputy to wolfowitz from a developing country .

12 . the price of shares in lse fell by 5.27 percent to 449 pence -lrb- 6.5 euros , $ 8.44 -rrb- in immediate response to the referral .
lse shares later stood at 452 pence in late afternoon trading , while deutsche börse fell by 0.72 percent to 59.14 euros and euronext tumbled 2.15 percent to 27.30 euros . " the oft today referred to the competition commission the anticipated acquisitions of the london stock exchange by deutsche börse and by euronext respectively , " the watchdog said in a statement following a two-month review . merger harming competition ? oft chairman john vickers said the proposed bids for the lse came at a time of emerging competition in equities trading between the lse , deutsche börse and euronext . " although such competition has so far been episodic , it needs to be investigated whether either merger would lessen future competition in equities trading in the uk , " vickers added .
" the competition commission will also want to consider the effects of the mergers on competition in clearing services , particularly with the deutsche börse bid . " the commission must complete its inquiry within 24 weeks , although it can apply for an eight-week extension should unforeseen complications arise .
any future formal bids for the lse would not be allowed to proceed before the commission ruled on the competition issues outlined by the oft . börse keeps options open deutsche börse made an offer at the end of january for 530 pence per share or just under two billion euros for the lse .
however , it withdrew the proposal on march 6 in the face of fierce resistance from london and stiff pressure from its own shareholders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange critics fear that a tie-up with frankfurt , which has its clearing and settlement operations under one roof , would have led to higher prices for lse users in trading , clearing and settlement . the german exchange has reserved the right to make a renewed offer should paris-based euronext turn an informal offer into a formal bid . euronext , operator of the exchanges in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon , meanwhile sees synergies worth 203 million euros from a merger . that amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of 100 million euros from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . lse open for discussions responding to the oft 's announcement , the lse said it was willing to continue discussions with potential bidders " about the possibility of an offer that fully values the london stock exchange and is capable of being recommended . " it added in a statement : " the board of the london stock exchange believes in the company 's strong growth prospects as the largest equity market in europe , but maintains that stock exchange consolidation , on the right terms , could be in the best interests of customers and shareholders . " euronext cooperative euronext meanwhile said that it would " work closely " with the commission and claimed that its takeover proposal would work to the advantage of lse customers and shareholders . " euronext is convinced that it is the natural partner for london stock exchange , and that a combination of euronext and lse would benefit users and create significant value for shareholders in both companies , " the company added . euronext , registered in the netherlands , has meanwhile said that the lse would remain a british exchange regulated solely by the british regulatory body , the financial services authority , if the two companies did a deal . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse announces share buy-back german stock exchange operator deutsche börse said late tuesday it was planning to launch a share buy-back .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .

" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .

they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .

several ex-diplomats in germany have struck out against their former boss joschka fischer for his role in the visa scandal .
the attacks may mean another nail in the foreign minister 's political coffin . joschka fischer was once considered a major trump card for german chancellor gerhard schröder .
but the green foreign minister now appears to be a mere king-sized headache for the government coalition of social democrats and greens .
fischer 's responsibility in the introduction of more lax visa-issuing regulations at the turn of the century can no longer be swept under the carpet .
these are believed to have directly aided massive human trafficking operations in eastern europe and ukraine in particular , bringing tens of thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 .
a parliamentary inquiry has started digging out unpleasant facts .
now , even former diplomats are speaking out against fischer , as they fear the further tainting of the foreign ministry ’ s international reputation .
fischer " ignored " advice while representatives of the parliamentary inquiry into the affair are still battling over when to summon the minister before the panel , former diplomats have vented their anger over fischer ’ s policy in the frankfurter allgemeine daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former diplomats fear that the foreign ministry 's reputation has been severely damaged the former ambassador to iran , russia and india , hans-georg wieck said the reputation of the foreign ministry was gravely damaged at home and abroad .
he accused fischer of having ignored the good advice of diplomats and acted without consulting those " on the frontline . "
wieck said one had to question just how long germany would be willing to tolerate such behavior without hindering the foreign office ’ s ability to act reliably .
catastrophic repercussions the fischer affair , wieck concluded , meant a loss of confidence in german foreign policy .
this was a point of view shared by the government commissioner for ethnic germans heinz-peter kemper , who is also a former intelligence officer and interior affairs spokesman .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people lined up in front of the german embassy in kiew to get a visa " i simply have to say that we ’ ve never been too happy about the 1999 visa decree and the way it was put into practice , " said kemper .
" we certainly want to know who comes to visit us and what they ’ re up to , " he added .
" and the fischer decree wasn ’ t particularly helpful in this regard , to say the least . "
germany ’ s former ambassador to the czech republic , hagen graf lambsdorff , spoke of " catastrophic repercussions " that fischer ’ s lax visa regulations are having .
as seldom as vegetarian crocodiles a week ago , another former high-ranking diplomat , ernst von studnitz , called fischer ’ s visa policy " a pitiful attempt " to turn green ideology into practical policy on a daily basis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer faces a tough battle with former diplomats revolting against the foreign minister , fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- faces a hard time preparing for the inquiry .
the opposition conservatives are demanding that the minister show up before the panel prior to crucial regional elections in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 .
they are already considering legal moves to drag fischer to the hearing .
but the latter is playing for time .
he ’ ll also have to defuse accusations by prosecutors that his ministry dragged its feet on handing over documents for a crucial trial and prevented a key witness from appearing in court in time .

1 .
it places limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other cancer-causing pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures , such as driving bans , if the pollution levels are too high . while most carmakers had said last year they would include filters by 2008 or 2009 , most major producers have now pushed the date forward : according to munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung , mercedes-benz diesel cars will come with the filter by the summer .
bmw has also announced that customers will be able to order their cars with filters in a few months , although they still have to pay extra for them in smaller models .
while audi and volkswagen will also charge for filters , ford still has n't announced their plans , the paper reported .
opel already offers filters for its diesel cars . buyers cautious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car industry analysts believe that as many as 30,000 germans are holding off on buying a new car because manufacturers have failed to offer filters so far . " customers will either wait or buy foreign cars , " car industry expert ferdinand düdenhöffer told welt am sonntag newspaper .
french car producers such as peugeot or citroen already offer their diesel cars with the filters .
but several carmakers said that part of the problem was that filters were hard to come by at the moment . german environment minister jürgen trittin has criticized carmakers for failing to introduce filters more swiftly .
but the federal government is also still embroiled in a fight with german states over who will pay for tax rebates meant as incentives to convince people to buy cars with filters .
states claim they will lose up to 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.94 billion -rrb- in taxes as a result and are calling on the federal government to compensate them . carmakers meanwhile also said they felt unfairly targeted , adding that diesel cars were only one of several pollutants . lawsuits pending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's skyline the pollution levels have already been exceeded in stuttgart and munich , causing residents of the two cities to file lawsuits calling on courts to order the municipal governments to take action against the pollution . but officials for the federation of german cities said they did n't believe the lawsuits would be successful as claimants had to prove a concrete and not an abstract threat to their health , according to dpa news service .
eu commission officials meanwhile said they would take action against germany for violating eu law should environmental groups call on brussels to do so . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission .

they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .
" anyone claiming something else today is not telling the truth . " he added that a return of the land would upset eastern germany 's new agricultural infrastructure that was painstakingly rebuilt after reunification . disowned farmers have been able to buy back their land , a step taken by von herder .
he paid one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- for his family 's estate . bernd grässler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules the german government could face a flood of lawsuits and billions in reparation claims after the european court of human rights ruled that the dispossession of land in eastern germany after reunification was illegal .

lse shares later stood at 452 pence in late afternoon trading , while deutsche börse fell by 0.72 percent to 59.14 euros and euronext tumbled 2.15 percent to 27.30 euros . " the oft today referred to the competition commission the anticipated acquisitions of the london stock exchange by deutsche börse and by euronext respectively , " the watchdog said in a statement following a two-month review . merger harming competition ? oft chairman john vickers said the proposed bids for the lse came at a time of emerging competition in equities trading between the lse , deutsche börse and euronext . " although such competition has so far been episodic , it needs to be investigated whether either merger would lessen future competition in equities trading in the uk , " vickers added .
" the competition commission will also want to consider the effects of the mergers on competition in clearing services , particularly with the deutsche börse bid . " the commission must complete its inquiry within 24 weeks , although it can apply for an eight-week extension should unforeseen complications arise .
any future formal bids for the lse would not be allowed to proceed before the commission ruled on the competition issues outlined by the oft . börse keeps options open deutsche börse made an offer at the end of january for 530 pence per share or just under two billion euros for the lse .
however , it withdrew the proposal on march 6 in the face of fierce resistance from london and stiff pressure from its own shareholders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange critics fear that a tie-up with frankfurt , which has its clearing and settlement operations under one roof , would have led to higher prices for lse users in trading , clearing and settlement . the german exchange has reserved the right to make a renewed offer should paris-based euronext turn an informal offer into a formal bid . euronext , operator of the exchanges in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon , meanwhile sees synergies worth 203 million euros from a merger . that amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of 100 million euros from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . lse open for discussions responding to the oft 's announcement , the lse said it was willing to continue discussions with potential bidders " about the possibility of an offer that fully values the london stock exchange and is capable of being recommended . " it added in a statement : " the board of the london stock exchange believes in the company 's strong growth prospects as the largest equity market in europe , but maintains that stock exchange consolidation , on the right terms , could be in the best interests of customers and shareholders . " euronext cooperative euronext meanwhile said that it would " work closely " with the commission and claimed that its takeover proposal would work to the advantage of lse customers and shareholders . " euronext is convinced that it is the natural partner for london stock exchange , and that a combination of euronext and lse would benefit users and create significant value for shareholders in both companies , " the company added . euronext , registered in the netherlands , has meanwhile said that the lse would remain a british exchange regulated solely by the british regulatory body , the financial services authority , if the two companies did a deal . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche börse announces share buy-back german stock exchange operator deutsche börse said late tuesday it was planning to launch a share buy-back .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .

the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .

the german government wo n't have to pay billions as a result . rejecting the claims by 71 land owners who had been dispossessed by soviet occupiers between 1945 and 1949 , the judges said the german government was under no obligation to compensate the claimants after reunification in 1990 . the court ruled that the federal republic of germany could not be held responsible for the actions of soviet occupiers nor the former east german goverment .
that 's why the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the matter , the judges concluded . a lawyer for the plaintiffs meanwhile said the group would now take their case to the un human rights commission . " we can not leave it at that , " thomas gertner said , according to ap news service . old owners disappointed at the center of the dispute was a decision by soviet leaders after world war ii to dispossess those eastern german farmers that owned more than 100 hectares -lrb- 247 acres -rrb- of land .
they distributed two thirds of it among rural workers and refugees while the rest remained with the state . with german unification in 1990 , one million hectares of land became the property of the federal republic .
the old owners , who had hoped to get their property back , were disappointed , however . carl-wilhelm von herder 's family , for example , lost their mansion and forest in what 's now the state of saxony .
herder believed that he would get back the land after reunification , but politicians and courts kept pointing to the german unification treaty .
the document states that land that was seized by the soviets between 1945 and 1949 could not be returned . " anyone who lost their land after 1949 got their land back , but no one even considered compensating us , " herder said . differing accounts the german government on the other hand has claimed that soviet leaders would not have permitted germany to unify in 1990 if the post-war land reform had not been accepted as a irreversible fact . but those involved in the negotiations offer differing accounts .
while former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev denies that his side insisted on keeping the land reform in place , former east german leaders said this is what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lothar de maiziere " the soviet claim was non-negotiable , " said lothar de maiziere , east germany 's only freely elected prime minister .
" anyone claiming something else today is not telling the truth . " he added that a return of the land would upset eastern germany 's new agricultural infrastructure that was painstakingly rebuilt after reunification . disowned farmers have been able to buy back their land , a step taken by von herder .

it is unveiling its first national strategy and extra funding worth more than £ 1m over the next three years .
according to official figures , nearly 27,000 incidents of domestic violence are reported to police in wales during a single year .
across the uk , nearly a quarter of all recorded violent crime stems from incidents of domestic abuse .
it is thought one in four women will be on the receiving end of violence from a partner at some time in their lives .
the assembly government is launching a national strategy to tackle the problem which it said has been developed with the help of all those agencies who help the victims of abuse .
there will be extra funding for those groups - an increase of £ 1.1m over the next three years .
police , health and social services and local authorities will be expected to draw up their own action plans to fit in with the new strategy .
the action plan has been welcomed by mandy weaver , whose late second husband beat her and kicked her over a period of six years .
an estimated one-in-four women will suffer domestic abuse ms weaver , of caerphilly , said : " whatever you do for education , you need money to do it , unfortunately .
" we want to stop -lrb- domestic abuse -rrb- going to the next generation .
" any money that comes in can get workers going into school , changing behaviour . "
experts in tackling domestic abuse held a national conference in cardiff this month to study how the city has dealt with the issue .
cardiff is held up as an example of best-practice in dealing with domestic violence , against men as well as women .
over the past three years , a women 's safety unit has cut the repeat victim rate from 30 % to 13 % .
last month , a pilot scheme began to help heterosexual , gay and bisexual men who are victims of domestic abuse .

it is unveiling its first national strategy and extra funding worth more than £ 1m over the next three years .
according to official figures , nearly 27,000 incidents of domestic violence are reported to police in wales during a single year .
across the uk , nearly a quarter of all recorded violent crime stems from incidents of domestic abuse .
it is thought one in four women will be on the receiving end of violence from a partner at some time in their lives .

police , health and social services and local authorities will be expected to draw up their own action plans to fit in with the new strategy .
the action plan has been welcomed by mandy weaver , whose late second husband beat her and kicked her over a period of six years .
an estimated one-in-four women will suffer domestic abuse ms weaver , of caerphilly , said : " whatever you do for education , you need money to do it , unfortunately .

" any money that comes in can get workers going into school , changing behaviour . "
experts in tackling domestic abuse held a national conference in cardiff this month to study how the city has dealt with the issue .
cardiff is held up as an example of best-practice in dealing with domestic violence , against men as well as women .
over the past three years , a women 's safety unit has cut the repeat victim rate from 30 % to 13 % .
last month , a pilot scheme began to help heterosexual , gay and bisexual men who are victims of domestic abuse .

residents of the carmarthenshire villages - on either side of the river tywi - voted to switch to digital-only after taking part in a pilot scheme .
the old analogue network is due to disappear across wales by 2008 - ahead of a planned uk changeover in 2012 .

a helpline was set up for residents ' teething problems , and one-to-one support was made available to the elderly .
after three months , the households were asked if they wanted to keep the digital services or revert to analogue only .
more than 85 % of households responded and 98 % voted to retain the digital services .

a department for culture media and sport spokesman said the government had no firm date for when the uk 's switchover would begin .
the government has said switching to digital would provide a major one-off boost for the uk economy .
but the department of trade and industry said on wednesday it was not clear what the analogue system would be used for , and its future had not yet been determined .
almost 60 % of households have already gone digital on at least one television set through cable , satellite or freeview .

it said a complete switchover would not be authorised until support measures were in place .

it is such a leap forward even with the basic digital service , they have just taken to it project director emyr byron hughes homes were given digital receivers for each of their televisions .
a helpline was set up for residents ' teething problems , and one-to-one support was made available to the elderly .
after three months , the households were asked if they wanted to keep the digital services or revert to analogue only .
more than 85 % of households responded and 98 % voted to retain the digital services .
project director emyr byron hughes said residents had taken to digital because it provided more services .
' leap forward ' he said : " it is such a leap forward even with the basic digital service , they have just taken to it . "
digital switchover by itv region htv wales 2008 border 2008 west country 2008 granada 2009 htv west 2009 grampian 2009 scottish tv 2009 central 2010 yorkshire 2010 anglia 2010 meridian 2011 carlton / lwt 2011 tyne tees 2011 ulster 2011 channel 2012 roy barnes , from ferryside , has been trying out digital services for the last three months .
" you can see more programmes , it 's much easier to watch channel 5 and channel four and i like the history programmes , " he said .
mr barnes said that he also listened to the digital radio stations via the television .
" it 's much clearer , i 've thrown my old radio away in the dustbin " .
the trial had been run to discover how people coped with the new equipment and to see what technical problems might arise in the future .
a department for culture media and sport spokesman said the government had no firm date for when the uk 's switchover would begin .
the government has said switching to digital would provide a major one-off boost for the uk economy .
but the department of trade and industry said on wednesday it was not clear what the analogue system would be used for , and its future had not yet been determined .
almost 60 % of households have already gone digital on at least one television set through cable , satellite or freeview .
but switching could be a problem for the elderly and those on poor incomes and the government is discussing with charities about how to protect the vulnerable .
it said a complete switchover would not be authorised until support measures were in place .

among the seven targets of the 1.3bn yen -lrb- $ 12m ; £ 6.5m -rrb- suit - several of whom also face criminal charges - are three ex-presidents of the company .
faults with the company 's trucks have been linked to fatal accidents .
the fall-out from the scandal has pushed the firm deep into the red and forced it to plead for rescue funds from its affiliates .
the company said the lawsuit was intended to make it clear to customers that it had changed its ways .
" to draw a clear line between right and wrong in terms of past recall problems ... the company will sue for damages against seven former directors and executive officers , including former chairmen and presidents , " it said in a statement .
locker the seven are being sued for an amount equivalent to their severance payments .
the three former presidents include katsuhiko kawasoe , who resigned in 2000 after the cover-up was revealed , triggering a massive recall .
mitsubishi had for decades kept defects secret from regulators and customers .
its behaviour only came to light after a cache of complaints was found hidden in a company locker room by government inspectors .
among the problems that were being reported and ignored were failing brakes , fuel leaks and malfunctioning clutches .
the financial plight that resulted from this led major shareholder daimler-chrysler to wash its hands of mitsubishi motors , leaving the firm 's rescue to affiliated japanese firms .

among the seven targets of the 1.3bn yen -lrb- $ 12m ; £ 6.5m -rrb- suit - several of whom also face criminal charges - are three ex-presidents of the company .
faults with the company 's trucks have been linked to fatal accidents .
the fall-out from the scandal has pushed the firm deep into the red and forced it to plead for rescue funds from its affiliates .
the company said the lawsuit was intended to make it clear to customers that it had changed its ways .
" to draw a clear line between right and wrong in terms of past recall problems ... the company will sue for damages against seven former directors and executive officers , including former chairmen and presidents , " it said in a statement .
locker the seven are being sued for an amount equivalent to their severance payments .
the three former presidents include katsuhiko kawasoe , who resigned in 2000 after the cover-up was revealed , triggering a massive recall .
mitsubishi had for decades kept defects secret from regulators and customers .
its behaviour only came to light after a cache of complaints was found hidden in a company locker room by government inspectors .
among the problems that were being reported and ignored were failing brakes , fuel leaks and malfunctioning clutches .
the financial plight that resulted from this led major shareholder daimler-chrysler to wash its hands of mitsubishi motors , leaving the firm 's rescue to affiliated japanese firms .

" compared to the bbc version ...
nbc 's version is so diluted there 's little left than muddy water , " its critic continued .
time magazine called the show " a daring , unflinching take on very american workplace tensions " .
but the washington post said carell " overdoes it at times " and was " no match for the wonderful ricky gervais " .

the hunters returned to the ice floes after the government gave the go-ahead for more than 300,000 seals to be killed this year .
authorities say the hunt is now more humane and that the rising seal population needs to be controlled .
as in previous years , animal rights groups are campaigning against the hunt , which they say is cruel .
the activists also say canada is trying to appease fishing communities for political reasons .
the fishermen blame the seals for the devastation of canada 's fish stocks and have pressed for a renewed culling .
the two-month hunt takes place on ice floes off the atlantic coast , where the seals give birth .
earlier this month , the department of fisheries and oceans said in a statement that canada 's seal population was healthy and abundant .
" the harp seal herd - the most important seal herd for this industry - is estimated at around five million animals , nearly the highest level ever recorded , and almost triple what it was in the 1970s . "
boycott large-scale hunting will be allowed to continue until the number falls to under four million .
one official told the afp news agency : " we have to do our job responsibly .
we are looking at the middle ground , taking into account conservation and the economic needs of the region . "
but anti-hunt activists , who claim many animals are skinned alive and die in agony , say they will press ahead with a boycott of canadian seafood .
" i think that -lsb- the canadian government -rsb- are feeling the heat ... they can see the really serious implication of going ahead with the hunt this year , " said pat ragan , of the humane society of the united states .
" we 're going to be encouraging consumers to enter into dialogue with their grocery stores and their restaurants and say , ' please do n't serve canadian seafood ' , or , ' i wo n't buy canadian seafood until this hunt is over ' , " she told reuters news agency .
the seal hunt in newfoundland and labrador went into decline some 25 years ago , after images of hunters clubbing infant seals horrified tv viewers across the world .

the campaign to protect rural england -lrb- cpre -rrb- is staging wednesday evening 's event so people in the county can have their say on the south east plan .
consultation on the proposals , drawn up by the south east england regional assembly -lrb- seera -rrb- , ends on 15 april .
the meeting takes place at the corn exchange in maidstone .
the cpre says the south east plan will be " hugely influential to kent 's future " and could shape house building , infrastructure provision and environmental protection until 2026 .
' right homes ' dr hilary newport , director of cpre kent , thinks it is important for people to have their say .
" there is certainly an awful lot of pressure to pack in as many houses as possible into the south east , or so it seems , " she said .
" what we are concerned about is really that this plan seems to be seeking to just pack in more jobs and more people , without any real interest being taken in the impact of that on our environment . "
dr newport agrees there is a need for more homes but hopes they will be planned properly .
" at the moment we are just packing in more homes into more very ordinary housing estates without raising the level of infrastructure ... and that simply can not be allowed to continue . "
joining dr newport as speakers at the meeting are paul bevan , seera 's chief executive , and sir sandy bruce-lockhart , leader of kent county council .
the finished plan is due to be submitted for government approval in october 2005 .
