gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

it ’ s a natural dream , given what scientists say about genes being the building blocks of life , the things that form our individual bodies and personalities . genes even help decide what kinds of illnesses we ’ ll get .
well scientists have a number of different ways of looking at your genes . one of them is the dna chip , or microarray . the chip was developed about a decade ago , and it takes some 30,000 genes , arranges them on a slide , and notes which ones are turned „ on “ and which ones are „ off . “ you see , each cell in your body has the same dna . but you ’ ve got different kinds of cells . how do the different kinds of cells grow out from the same dna ? well , for each cell , a different set of the genes in your dna is turned „ on “ or „ off “ – that is , are active , or inactive . for a liver cell , or a skin cell , or a heart cell , which genes are „ on “ and which are „ off “ is different . the process by which genes are turned on or off is called gene regulation .
but for some people , gene regulation isn ’ t working correctly .
the right genes aren ’ t turned „ on “ or „ off . “ those people have genetic defects – for example , a defective heart . thousands of people are born each year with defective hearts . they are a major cause of cardiovascular disease , and often death .
but scientists at the max-planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin have found a new way to treat defective hearts . they take a piece of a person 's heart , and then examine it with the the dna chip . that way , they can know exactly if , and how , the heart is defective . and then they can develop a treatment just suited to the individual . click below and dr. silke sperling will give us hope for genetically deformed hearts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 www-links max planck society for the advancement of the sciences for more on this and other research , visit the english language website of the max planck society 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon . germany 's first ambassador to israel was , at best , a strange selection .
a former major in the wehrmacht , rolf pauls lost an arm in combat against the allies during wwii .
israelis , already suspicious of the plan to resume diplomatic relations with germany in 1965 , were outraged .
pauls ' car was attacked with rocks and bottles on his way to his swearing in ceremony , according to historical accounts .
but pauls soon proved he possessed the necessary sophistication that his new post required .
by the time he left again in 1967 , he had endeared himself to his israeli hosts so much that former israeli diplomat avi primor remarked that he was " received with stones and sent off with roses . "
german president horst köhler is likely to get a more sober reception during his four-day visit to israel this week to mark 40 years of german-israeli relations .
in addition to meetings with prime minister ariel sharon as well as his israeli counterpart , köhler will give a speech before the israeli parliament , the knesset , on wednesday .
he is only the second german politician to do so after president johannes rau -lrb- photo , below -rrb- five years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german president johannes rau in israel in 2003 the address has been the subject of heated debate in israel , with some parliamentarians objecting last week to köhler being allowed to give the speech in german .
though tempers have cooled since then , the incident highlights just how difficult the relationship between the two countries continues to be .
normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .
" it takes time . "
balanced approach that is n't to say that strides have n't been made on a political and economic level .
after the us , germany is israel 's most important trading partner .
german companies like sap and siemens are well represented in the middle eastern country and a joint mining venture between volkswagen and dead sea works is considered the beginning of more german-israeli ventures , according to the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer beginning in the late 1990s , germany , and particularly foreign minister joschka fischer , took a special interest in mediating the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
though the us remains israel 's main partner in the peace process , fischer 's balanced approach to the problem has won him supporters in " every political party , " said büttner .
recent events in germany show that hitches remain .
the success of the right-wing , anti-semitic national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in getting voted into the saxony state parliament last autumn set off alarm bells in israel .
sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .
" it is a fact that we 're confronted with , and it prompts a certain fallout in israel . "
spiegel has campaigned for finding better ways to teach german schoolchildren about the holocaust in an effort to increase their sensibilities .
but his efforts have fallen on deaf ears , he said . " i have n't gotten any reaction so far . "
cultural understanding is perhaps the most important tool politicians will have in dispelling israeli misconceptions about germany , said martin beck , middle eastern expert at the german institute for middle east studies , in hamburg . " the cultural relationship between germany and israel is perhaps more developed than any other european country has with israel , " said beck in an interview .

though tempers have cooled since then , the incident highlights just how difficult the relationship between the two countries continues to be .
normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .
" it takes time . "
balanced approach that is n't to say that strides have n't been made on a political and economic level .
after the us , germany is israel 's most important trading partner .
german companies like sap and siemens are well represented in the middle eastern country and a joint mining venture between volkswagen and dead sea works is considered the beginning of more german-israeli ventures , according to the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer beginning in the late 1990s , germany , and particularly foreign minister joschka fischer , took a special interest in mediating the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
though the us remains israel 's main partner in the peace process , fischer 's balanced approach to the problem has won him supporters in " every political party , " said büttner .
recent events in germany show that hitches remain .
the success of the right-wing , anti-semitic national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in getting voted into the saxony state parliament last autumn set off alarm bells in israel .
sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .
" it is a fact that we 're confronted with , and it prompts a certain fallout in israel . "
spiegel has campaigned for finding better ways to teach german schoolchildren about the holocaust in an effort to increase their sensibilities .
but his efforts have fallen on deaf ears , he said . " i have n't gotten any reaction so far . "
cultural understanding is perhaps the most important tool politicians will have in dispelling israeli misconceptions about germany , said martin beck , middle eastern expert at the german institute for middle east studies , in hamburg . " the cultural relationship between germany and israel is perhaps more developed than any other european country has with israel , " said beck in an interview .
" that is very important .
an exchange on all levels , not just a political level , is crucial to dismantling israeli suspicion and to showing them that the germany of today has nothing to do with the germany of national socialism .

the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon . germany 's first ambassador to israel was , at best , a strange selection .
a former major in the wehrmacht , rolf pauls lost an arm in combat against the allies during wwii .
israelis , already suspicious of the plan to resume diplomatic relations with germany in 1965 , were outraged .
pauls ' car was attacked with rocks and bottles on his way to his swearing in ceremony , according to historical accounts .
but pauls soon proved he possessed the necessary sophistication that his new post required .
by the time he left again in 1967 , he had endeared himself to his israeli hosts so much that former israeli diplomat avi primor remarked that he was " received with stones and sent off with roses . "
german president horst köhler is likely to get a more sober reception during his four-day visit to israel this week to mark 40 years of german-israeli relations .
in addition to meetings with prime minister ariel sharon as well as his israeli counterpart , köhler will give a speech before the israeli parliament , the knesset , on wednesday .
he is only the second german politician to do so after president johannes rau -lrb- photo , below -rrb- five years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german president johannes rau in israel in 2003 the address has been the subject of heated debate in israel , with some parliamentarians objecting last week to köhler being allowed to give the speech in german .
though tempers have cooled since then , the incident highlights just how difficult the relationship between the two countries continues to be .
normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .
" it takes time . "

after the us , germany is israel 's most important trading partner .
german companies like sap and siemens are well represented in the middle eastern country and a joint mining venture between volkswagen and dead sea works is considered the beginning of more german-israeli ventures , according to the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer beginning in the late 1990s , germany , and particularly foreign minister joschka fischer , took a special interest in mediating the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
though the us remains israel 's main partner in the peace process , fischer 's balanced approach to the problem has won him supporters in " every political party , " said büttner .
recent events in germany show that hitches remain .
the success of the right-wing , anti-semitic national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in getting voted into the saxony state parliament last autumn set off alarm bells in israel .
sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .
" it is a fact that we 're confronted with , and it prompts a certain fallout in israel . "
spiegel has campaigned for finding better ways to teach german schoolchildren about the holocaust in an effort to increase their sensibilities .
but his efforts have fallen on deaf ears , he said . " i have n't gotten any reaction so far . "
cultural understanding is perhaps the most important tool politicians will have in dispelling israeli misconceptions about germany , said martin beck , middle eastern expert at the german institute for middle east studies , in hamburg . " the cultural relationship between germany and israel is perhaps more developed than any other european country has with israel , " said beck in an interview .

it ’ s a natural dream , given what scientists say about genes being the building blocks of life , the things that form our individual bodies and personalities . genes even help decide what kinds of illnesses we ’ ll get .
well scientists have a number of different ways of looking at your genes . one of them is the dna chip , or microarray . the chip was developed about a decade ago , and it takes some 30,000 genes , arranges them on a slide , and notes which ones are turned „ on “ and which ones are „ off . “ you see , each cell in your body has the same dna . but you ’ ve got different kinds of cells . how do the different kinds of cells grow out from the same dna ? well , for each cell , a different set of the genes in your dna is turned „ on “ or „ off “ – that is , are active , or inactive . for a liver cell , or a skin cell , or a heart cell , which genes are „ on “ and which are „ off “ is different . the process by which genes are turned on or off is called gene regulation .
but for some people , gene regulation isn ’ t working correctly .
the right genes aren ’ t turned „ on “ or „ off . “ those people have genetic defects – for example , a defective heart . thousands of people are born each year with defective hearts . they are a major cause of cardiovascular disease , and often death .
but scientists at the max-planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin have found a new way to treat defective hearts . they take a piece of a person 's heart , and then examine it with the the dna chip . that way , they can know exactly if , and how , the heart is defective . and then they can develop a treatment just suited to the individual . click below and dr. silke sperling will give us hope for genetically deformed hearts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 www-links max planck society for the advancement of the sciences for more on this and other research , visit the english language website of the max planck society 9800 dw-tv europe live journal - news with in depth we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .
the number of tickets allocated for the world cup 2006 is supposed to guarantee not just sold-out stadiums but full , sold-out stadiums . the 12 stadiums that will host the games around germany will have a gross capacity of 3.37 million for the 64 matches , but with 440,000 seats reserved for vip guests and the media , a total of around 2.93 million tickets will go on sale globally .
however this figure includes tickets allocated to the national federations for them to distribute . ticket ownership a precious thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security measures for the tickets are some of the most extensive for a sporting event .
the tickets , which will look like flight coupons , will come printed with the name of each supporter and random checks will be carried out as fans enter stadiums . theoretically , that will boost security and cut down on ticket touting , but it will also be hugely annoying to fans , particularly those who have bought tickets at random . " in principle , the tickets are not transferable , " said schmidt .
" the tickets do n't just look like plane tickets , they 're similar in terms of the way they can be transferred and that can only be with a change of name . " the message being if you are lucky enough to get a world cup ticket , guard it with your life . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .

a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .

they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

by the time he left again in 1967 , he had endeared himself to his israeli hosts so much that former israeli diplomat avi primor remarked that he was " received with stones and sent off with roses . "
german president horst köhler is likely to get a more sober reception during his four-day visit to israel this week to mark 40 years of german-israeli relations .

normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .

büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german president johannes rau in israel in 2003 the address has been the subject of heated debate in israel , with some parliamentarians objecting last week to köhler being allowed to give the speech in german .

normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .

sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .
" it is a fact that we 're confronted with , and it prompts a certain fallout in israel . "
spiegel has campaigned for finding better ways to teach german schoolchildren about the holocaust in an effort to increase their sensibilities .

cultural understanding is perhaps the most important tool politicians will have in dispelling israeli misconceptions about germany , said martin beck , middle eastern expert at the german institute for middle east studies , in hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

to realize plans for substituting the aging analogue radio , schily invited his colleagues , the interior ministers of all 16 states , to a special conference where he intends to suggest that the financing of the project be split in central government and federal state components .
the central government would then take over the costs for equipping the federal border guard with modern communication means .
amounting to € 800 million , these costs would cover more than 25 percent of the whole project and present a much bigger concession on part of the central government than the originally promised 8.5 percent . more briefs 02.02.2005 -pipe- finances vary among german students 01.02.2005 -pipe- world cup tickets selling swiftly 01.02.2005 -pipe- german nurse accused of killing 29 patients 01.02.2005 -pipe- bank plans loans for german students 31.01.2005 -pipe- hesse 's premier rejects uniform tuition 31.01.2005 -pipe- match-fixing soccer scandal expands 31.01.2005 -pipe- calls for npd ban increase 30.01.2005 -pipe- police clash with anti-nazi protestors radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .
" that israel can live within internationally recognized borders , free from fear and terror , is an incontestable maxim of german politics . " " my country has always demonstrated this by its actions .
germany stands unswervingly side by side with israel and its people , " he said . lessons learnt from survivors must endure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler meets with ariel sharon before the speech in the knesset .
in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .
their recollections must not be lost , " he said . " the faces of the victims must not be forgotten .
we must ensure that the teachings of a generation will be passed on to the next generation .
and we must all grasp the fact that the victims of the shoah have given us a duty : to never allow genocide to happen again .
will we do justice to this duty ? " köhler vows to fight anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman passes by a jewish memorial , desecrated with nazi symbols , at a cemetery in dortmund , germany .
the german president also stressed that his country would be unstinting in its fight against anti-semitism and any effort to downplay the horrors of the holocaust in which at least six million jews were killed . " every open society also has enemies .
xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .
we must seek to oppose right-wing extremists and anti-semites through political means and we must do so aggressively . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .
" that israel can live within internationally recognized borders , free from fear and terror , is an incontestable maxim of german politics . " " my country has always demonstrated this by its actions .
germany stands unswervingly side by side with israel and its people , " he said . lessons learnt from survivors must endure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler meets with ariel sharon before the speech in the knesset .
in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .
their recollections must not be lost , " he said . " the faces of the victims must not be forgotten .
we must ensure that the teachings of a generation will be passed on to the next generation .
and we must all grasp the fact that the victims of the shoah have given us a duty : to never allow genocide to happen again .
will we do justice to this duty ? " köhler vows to fight anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman passes by a jewish memorial , desecrated with nazi symbols , at a cemetery in dortmund , germany .
the german president also stressed that his country would be unstinting in its fight against anti-semitism and any effort to downplay the horrors of the holocaust in which at least six million jews were killed . " every open society also has enemies .
xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .
we must seek to oppose right-wing extremists and anti-semites through political means and we must do so aggressively . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

to realize plans for substituting the aging analogue radio , schily invited his colleagues , the interior ministers of all 16 states , to a special conference where he intends to suggest that the financing of the project be split in central government and federal state components .
the central government would then take over the costs for equipping the federal border guard with modern communication means .
amounting to € 800 million , these costs would cover more than 25 percent of the whole project and present a much bigger concession on part of the central government than the originally promised 8.5 percent . more briefs 02.02.2005 -pipe- finances vary among german students 01.02.2005 -pipe- world cup tickets selling swiftly 01.02.2005 -pipe- german nurse accused of killing 29 patients 01.02.2005 -pipe- bank plans loans for german students 31.01.2005 -pipe- hesse 's premier rejects uniform tuition 31.01.2005 -pipe- match-fixing soccer scandal expands 31.01.2005 -pipe- calls for npd ban increase 30.01.2005 -pipe- police clash with anti-nazi protestors radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to realize plans for substituting the aging analogue radio , schily invited his colleagues , the interior ministers of all 16 states , to a special conference where he intends to suggest that the financing of the project be split in central government and federal state components .
the central government would then take over the costs for equipping the federal border guard with modern communication means .
amounting to € 800 million , these costs would cover more than 25 percent of the whole project and present a much bigger concession on part of the central government than the originally promised 8.5 percent . more briefs 02.02.2005 -pipe- finances vary among german students 01.02.2005 -pipe- world cup tickets selling swiftly 01.02.2005 -pipe- german nurse accused of killing 29 patients 01.02.2005 -pipe- bank plans loans for german students 31.01.2005 -pipe- hesse 's premier rejects uniform tuition 31.01.2005 -pipe- match-fixing soccer scandal expands 31.01.2005 -pipe- calls for npd ban increase 30.01.2005 -pipe- police clash with anti-nazi protestors radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" otherwise , cabinet ministers could no longer travel and that would make it impossible to conduct political negotiations , " kreicker said , adding that rumsfeld would lose immunity upon his leaving office . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuit against rumsfeld threatens us-german relations the pentagon made thinly veiled threats on monday , suggesting us-german relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in german courts over abu ghraib proceeds .

it ’ s a natural dream , given what scientists say about genes being the building blocks of life , the things that form our individual bodies and personalities . genes even help decide what kinds of illnesses we ’ ll get .
well scientists have a number of different ways of looking at your genes . one of them is the dna chip , or microarray . the chip was developed about a decade ago , and it takes some 30,000 genes , arranges them on a slide , and notes which ones are turned „ on “ and which ones are „ off . “ you see , each cell in your body has the same dna . but you ’ ve got different kinds of cells . how do the different kinds of cells grow out from the same dna ? well , for each cell , a different set of the genes in your dna is turned „ on “ or „ off “ – that is , are active , or inactive . for a liver cell , or a skin cell , or a heart cell , which genes are „ on “ and which are „ off “ is different . the process by which genes are turned on or off is called gene regulation .
but for some people , gene regulation isn ’ t working correctly .
the right genes aren ’ t turned „ on “ or „ off . “ those people have genetic defects – for example , a defective heart . thousands of people are born each year with defective hearts . they are a major cause of cardiovascular disease , and often death .
but scientists at the max-planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin have found a new way to treat defective hearts . they take a piece of a person 's heart , and then examine it with the the dna chip . that way , they can know exactly if , and how , the heart is defective . and then they can develop a treatment just suited to the individual . click below and dr. silke sperling will give us hope for genetically deformed hearts . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 www-links max planck society for the advancement of the sciences for more on this and other research , visit the english language website of the max planck society dw-tv europe live quadriga we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 02.02.2005 server stutters but world cup sales boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system held as some 70,000 fans entered the online ticket lottery despite struggling with a slow internet server , fifa officials were pleased to announce their online ticket portal survived the first day of world cup 2006 trading . around 500,000 tickets for the 2006 world cup finals in germany were ordered in the first 16 hours after going on sale to the general public on tuesday , the organizing committee said . seventy thousand people from 120 countries placed orders through the internet after the site , www.fifaworldcup.com , opened for business at midnight -lrb- 2300 gmt -rrb- .
around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .
the number of tickets allocated for the world cup 2006 is supposed to guarantee not just sold-out stadiums but full , sold-out stadiums . the 12 stadiums that will host the games around germany will have a gross capacity of 3.37 million for the 64 matches , but with 440,000 seats reserved for vip guests and the media , a total of around 2.93 million tickets will go on sale globally .
however this figure includes tickets allocated to the national federations for them to distribute . ticket ownership a precious thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security measures for the tickets are some of the most extensive for a sporting event .
the tickets , which will look like flight coupons , will come printed with the name of each supporter and random checks will be carried out as fans enter stadiums . theoretically , that will boost security and cut down on ticket touting , but it will also be hugely annoying to fans , particularly those who have bought tickets at random . " in principle , the tickets are not transferable , " said schmidt .
" the tickets do n't just look like plane tickets , they 're similar in terms of the way they can be transferred and that can only be with a change of name .

to realize plans for substituting the aging analogue radio , schily invited his colleagues , the interior ministers of all 16 states , to a special conference where he intends to suggest that the financing of the project be split in central government and federal state components .
the central government would then take over the costs for equipping the federal border guard with modern communication means .
amounting to € 800 million , these costs would cover more than 25 percent of the whole project and present a much bigger concession on part of the central government than the originally promised 8.5 percent . more briefs 02.02.2005 -pipe- finances vary among german students 01.02.2005 -pipe- world cup tickets selling swiftly 01.02.2005 -pipe- german nurse accused of killing 29 patients 01.02.2005 -pipe- bank plans loans for german students 31.01.2005 -pipe- hesse 's premier rejects uniform tuition 31.01.2005 -pipe- match-fixing soccer scandal expands 31.01.2005 -pipe- calls for npd ban increase 30.01.2005 -pipe- police clash with anti-nazi protestors radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 02.02.2005 server stutters but world cup sales boom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the system held as some 70,000 fans entered the online ticket lottery despite struggling with a slow internet server , fifa officials were pleased to announce their online ticket portal survived the first day of world cup 2006 trading . around 500,000 tickets for the 2006 world cup finals in germany were ordered in the first 16 hours after going on sale to the general public on tuesday , the organizing committee said . seventy thousand people from 120 countries placed orders through the internet after the site , www.fifaworldcup.com , opened for business at midnight -lrb- 2300 gmt -rrb- .
around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .

around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .
the number of tickets allocated for the world cup 2006 is supposed to guarantee not just sold-out stadiums but full , sold-out stadiums . the 12 stadiums that will host the games around germany will have a gross capacity of 3.37 million for the 64 matches , but with 440,000 seats reserved for vip guests and the media , a total of around 2.93 million tickets will go on sale globally .
however this figure includes tickets allocated to the national federations for them to distribute . ticket ownership a precious thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security measures for the tickets are some of the most extensive for a sporting event .
the tickets , which will look like flight coupons , will come printed with the name of each supporter and random checks will be carried out as fans enter stadiums . theoretically , that will boost security and cut down on ticket touting , but it will also be hugely annoying to fans , particularly those who have bought tickets at random . " in principle , the tickets are not transferable , " said schmidt .
" the tickets do n't just look like plane tickets , they 're similar in terms of the way they can be transferred and that can only be with a change of name . " the message being if you are lucky enough to get a world cup ticket , guard it with your life . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .

german president horst köhler is likely to get a more sober reception during his four-day visit to israel this week to mark 40 years of german-israeli relations .
in addition to meetings with prime minister ariel sharon as well as his israeli counterpart , köhler will give a speech before the israeli parliament , the knesset , on wednesday .
he is only the second german politician to do so after president johannes rau -lrb- photo , below -rrb- five years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german president johannes rau in israel in 2003 the address has been the subject of heated debate in israel , with some parliamentarians objecting last week to köhler being allowed to give the speech in german .
though tempers have cooled since then , the incident highlights just how difficult the relationship between the two countries continues to be .
normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .
" it takes time . "
balanced approach that is n't to say that strides have n't been made on a political and economic level .
after the us , germany is israel 's most important trading partner .
german companies like sap and siemens are well represented in the middle eastern country and a joint mining venture between volkswagen and dead sea works is considered the beginning of more german-israeli ventures , according to the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer beginning in the late 1990s , germany , and particularly foreign minister joschka fischer , took a special interest in mediating the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
though the us remains israel 's main partner in the peace process , fischer 's balanced approach to the problem has won him supporters in " every political party , " said büttner .
recent events in germany show that hitches remain .
the success of the right-wing , anti-semitic national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in getting voted into the saxony state parliament last autumn set off alarm bells in israel .
sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .
" it is a fact that we 're confronted with , and it prompts a certain fallout in israel . "
spiegel has campaigned for finding better ways to teach german schoolchildren about the holocaust in an effort to increase their sensibilities .
but his efforts have fallen on deaf ears , he said . " i have n't gotten any reaction so far . "
cultural understanding is perhaps the most important tool politicians will have in dispelling israeli misconceptions about germany , said martin beck , middle eastern expert at the german institute for middle east studies , in hamburg . " the cultural relationship between germany and israel is perhaps more developed than any other european country has with israel , " said beck in an interview .
" that is very important .

around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .
the number of tickets allocated for the world cup 2006 is supposed to guarantee not just sold-out stadiums but full , sold-out stadiums . the 12 stadiums that will host the games around germany will have a gross capacity of 3.37 million for the 64 matches , but with 440,000 seats reserved for vip guests and the media , a total of around 2.93 million tickets will go on sale globally .
however this figure includes tickets allocated to the national federations for them to distribute . ticket ownership a precious thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security measures for the tickets are some of the most extensive for a sporting event .
the tickets , which will look like flight coupons , will come printed with the name of each supporter and random checks will be carried out as fans enter stadiums . theoretically , that will boost security and cut down on ticket touting , but it will also be hugely annoying to fans , particularly those who have bought tickets at random . " in principle , the tickets are not transferable , " said schmidt .
" the tickets do n't just look like plane tickets , they 're similar in terms of the way they can be transferred and that can only be with a change of name . " the message being if you are lucky enough to get a world cup ticket , guard it with your life . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .
the number of tickets allocated for the world cup 2006 is supposed to guarantee not just sold-out stadiums but full , sold-out stadiums . the 12 stadiums that will host the games around germany will have a gross capacity of 3.37 million for the 64 matches , but with 440,000 seats reserved for vip guests and the media , a total of around 2.93 million tickets will go on sale globally .
however this figure includes tickets allocated to the national federations for them to distribute . ticket ownership a precious thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security measures for the tickets are some of the most extensive for a sporting event .
the tickets , which will look like flight coupons , will come printed with the name of each supporter and random checks will be carried out as fans enter stadiums . theoretically , that will boost security and cut down on ticket touting , but it will also be hugely annoying to fans , particularly those who have bought tickets at random . " in principle , the tickets are not transferable , " said schmidt .
" the tickets do n't just look like plane tickets , they 're similar in terms of the way they can be transferred and that can only be with a change of name . " the message being if you are lucky enough to get a world cup ticket , guard it with your life . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .

to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .

will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . more than 350 films will be showing at the february 10-21 festival known as the berlinale , including 21 productions competing for the prestigious golden bear award for best film . smith and reeves are two of the big hollywood names tentatively lined up to appear at the festival to sprinkle some stardust and promote their movies , which are rivals for best film .
in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .
last year 's winner , the german film " head on , " about the struggles of a turkish couple in germany , has gone on to collect a clutch of international awards and has even attracted interest in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale director dieter kosslick " we do n't want to be the hottest festival , but the most pleasant and the most friendly one , " festival director dieter kosslick told a press conference .
with germany currently gripped by the scandal of a referee who has admitted fixing football matches , kosslick tapped into the theme by claiming this year 's festival would feature " football , sex and politics . " kinsey and " deep throat " the sex comes in the form of the us-german co-production " kinsey , " about the man regarded as the father of scientific research into human sexual behavior .
starring liam neeson and laura linney , " kinsey " will be the last of the competition films shown .
" inside deep throat , " meanwhile , supplies sex of a different kind , examining the cultural impact of the 1972 porn classic . soccer fans will doubtless enjoy the episodic " one day in europe , " in which football fans in russia , turkey , spain and germany fall prey to thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale begins on feb .
10 the berlinale will also maintain its customary special focus on african films .
the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .

in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .

xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .
" that israel can live within internationally recognized borders , free from fear and terror , is an incontestable maxim of german politics . " " my country has always demonstrated this by its actions .
germany stands unswervingly side by side with israel and its people , " he said . lessons learnt from survivors must endure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler meets with ariel sharon before the speech in the knesset .
in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .
their recollections must not be lost , " he said . " the faces of the victims must not be forgotten .
we must ensure that the teachings of a generation will be passed on to the next generation .
and we must all grasp the fact that the victims of the shoah have given us a duty : to never allow genocide to happen again .
will we do justice to this duty ? " köhler vows to fight anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman passes by a jewish memorial , desecrated with nazi symbols , at a cemetery in dortmund , germany .
the german president also stressed that his country would be unstinting in its fight against anti-semitism and any effort to downplay the horrors of the holocaust in which at least six million jews were killed . " every open society also has enemies .
xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .
we must seek to oppose right-wing extremists and anti-semites through political means and we must do so aggressively . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.02.2005 efforts to integrate gypsies gather speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's sinti and roma often face discrimination ambitious plans are afoot in central and eastern europe to integrate gypsies , or sinti and roma - one of the continent 's largest ethnic minorities - into mainstream society within a decade . the plans , which include ending the segregation of gypsies in schools and eradicating all-gypsy ramshackle housing projects , are part of national action plans worked out in eight of the region 's countries , whose leaders meet in sofia , bulgaria , on wednesday to discuss sinti and roma integration .
gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .
the number of tickets allocated for the world cup 2006 is supposed to guarantee not just sold-out stadiums but full , sold-out stadiums . the 12 stadiums that will host the games around germany will have a gross capacity of 3.37 million for the 64 matches , but with 440,000 seats reserved for vip guests and the media , a total of around 2.93 million tickets will go on sale globally .
however this figure includes tickets allocated to the national federations for them to distribute . ticket ownership a precious thing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security measures for the tickets are some of the most extensive for a sporting event .
the tickets , which will look like flight coupons , will come printed with the name of each supporter and random checks will be carried out as fans enter stadiums . theoretically , that will boost security and cut down on ticket touting , but it will also be hugely annoying to fans , particularly those who have bought tickets at random . " in principle , the tickets are not transferable , " said schmidt .
" the tickets do n't just look like plane tickets , they 're similar in terms of the way they can be transferred and that can only be with a change of name . " the message being if you are lucky enough to get a world cup ticket , guard it with your life . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the most sought-after tickets in sport the 2006 world cup in germany is attracting major interest from fans around the globe , all wanting to get their hands on tickets for the games .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .

" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .

while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .

" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money german tsunami early warning system takes shape germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 indonesia imports german tsunami warning model großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the german and us models rely on buoys and sensors indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific . earlier this week news emerged that indonesia , the country worst-affected by the tsunami last december , had decided to go in for an early warning system developed by the geo research center in potsdam , germany .
according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money german tsunami early warning system takes shape germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 indonesia imports german tsunami warning model großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the german and us models rely on buoys and sensors indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific . earlier this week news emerged that indonesia , the country worst-affected by the tsunami last december , had decided to go in for an early warning system developed by the geo research center in potsdam , germany .
according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .

a former major in the wehrmacht , rolf pauls lost an arm in combat against the allies during wwii .
israelis , already suspicious of the plan to resume diplomatic relations with germany in 1965 , were outraged .
pauls ' car was attacked with rocks and bottles on his way to his swearing in ceremony , according to historical accounts .
but pauls soon proved he possessed the necessary sophistication that his new post required .
by the time he left again in 1967 , he had endeared himself to his israeli hosts so much that former israeli diplomat avi primor remarked that he was " received with stones and sent off with roses . "
german president horst köhler is likely to get a more sober reception during his four-day visit to israel this week to mark 40 years of german-israeli relations .

though tempers have cooled since then , the incident highlights just how difficult the relationship between the two countries continues to be .
normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .
" it takes time . "
balanced approach that is n't to say that strides have n't been made on a political and economic level .
after the us , germany is israel 's most important trading partner .
german companies like sap and siemens are well represented in the middle eastern country and a joint mining venture between volkswagen and dead sea works is considered the beginning of more german-israeli ventures , according to the german foreign ministry .

recent events in germany show that hitches remain .

sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money german tsunami early warning system takes shape germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 indonesia imports german tsunami warning model großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the german and us models rely on buoys and sensors indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific . earlier this week news emerged that indonesia , the country worst-affected by the tsunami last december , had decided to go in for an early warning system developed by the geo research center in potsdam , germany .
according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .

he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .

the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .

a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money german tsunami early warning system takes shape germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 indonesia imports german tsunami warning model großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the german and us models rely on buoys and sensors indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific . earlier this week news emerged that indonesia , the country worst-affected by the tsunami last december , had decided to go in for an early warning system developed by the geo research center in potsdam , germany .
according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .
last year 's winner , the german film " head on , " about the struggles of a turkish couple in germany , has gone on to collect a clutch of international awards and has even attracted interest in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale director dieter kosslick " we do n't want to be the hottest festival , but the most pleasant and the most friendly one , " festival director dieter kosslick told a press conference .

the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . more than 350 films will be showing at the february 10-21 festival known as the berlinale , including 21 productions competing for the prestigious golden bear award for best film . smith and reeves are two of the big hollywood names tentatively lined up to appear at the festival to sprinkle some stardust and promote their movies , which are rivals for best film .
in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .
last year 's winner , the german film " head on , " about the struggles of a turkish couple in germany , has gone on to collect a clutch of international awards and has even attracted interest in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale director dieter kosslick " we do n't want to be the hottest festival , but the most pleasant and the most friendly one , " festival director dieter kosslick told a press conference .
with germany currently gripped by the scandal of a referee who has admitted fixing football matches , kosslick tapped into the theme by claiming this year 's festival would feature " football , sex and politics . " kinsey and " deep throat " the sex comes in the form of the us-german co-production " kinsey , " about the man regarded as the father of scientific research into human sexual behavior .
starring liam neeson and laura linney , " kinsey " will be the last of the competition films shown .
" inside deep throat , " meanwhile , supplies sex of a different kind , examining the cultural impact of the 1972 porn classic . soccer fans will doubtless enjoy the episodic " one day in europe , " in which football fans in russia , turkey , spain and germany fall prey to thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale begins on feb .
10 the berlinale will also maintain its customary special focus on african films .
the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .

the relationship , though very friendly , is anything but normal , say experts .
and that wo n't change any time soon . germany 's first ambassador to israel was , at best , a strange selection .
a former major in the wehrmacht , rolf pauls lost an arm in combat against the allies during wwii .
israelis , already suspicious of the plan to resume diplomatic relations with germany in 1965 , were outraged .
pauls ' car was attacked with rocks and bottles on his way to his swearing in ceremony , according to historical accounts .
but pauls soon proved he possessed the necessary sophistication that his new post required .
by the time he left again in 1967 , he had endeared himself to his israeli hosts so much that former israeli diplomat avi primor remarked that he was " received with stones and sent off with roses . "
german president horst köhler is likely to get a more sober reception during his four-day visit to israel this week to mark 40 years of german-israeli relations .
in addition to meetings with prime minister ariel sharon as well as his israeli counterpart , köhler will give a speech before the israeli parliament , the knesset , on wednesday .
he is only the second german politician to do so after president johannes rau -lrb- photo , below -rrb- five years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then german president johannes rau in israel in 2003 the address has been the subject of heated debate in israel , with some parliamentarians objecting last week to köhler being allowed to give the speech in german .
though tempers have cooled since then , the incident highlights just how difficult the relationship between the two countries continues to be .
normality takes time " that we are still discussing today whether it 's a normal relationship , like our relationship to denmark or italy , is a sign that it 's not , " said friedemann büttner , a middle eastern studies professor at berlin 's freie universität .
germany 's role as the aggressor nation in wwii is something that it has had trouble overcoming with many former declared enemies .
büttner gave the country 's relationship with france as an example .
though diplomatic relations with france have been in place for more than forty years , it was only last year that a german chancellor took part in the ceremony commemorating d-day in normandy . " i ca n't imagine a similar situation with israel , " he said in an interview .
" it takes time . "
balanced approach that is n't to say that strides have n't been made on a political and economic level .
after the us , germany is israel 's most important trading partner .
german companies like sap and siemens are well represented in the middle eastern country and a joint mining venture between volkswagen and dead sea works is considered the beginning of more german-israeli ventures , according to the german foreign ministry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer beginning in the late 1990s , germany , and particularly foreign minister joschka fischer , took a special interest in mediating the conflict between israel and the palestinian authority .
though the us remains israel 's main partner in the peace process , fischer 's balanced approach to the problem has won him supporters in " every political party , " said büttner .
recent events in germany show that hitches remain .
the success of the right-wing , anti-semitic national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- in getting voted into the saxony state parliament last autumn set off alarm bells in israel .
sensitivity training " it 's a fact that we can not ignore , " paul spiegel , head of the german central council of jews said in a recent radio interview .
" it is a fact that we 're confronted with , and it prompts a certain fallout in israel . "
spiegel has campaigned for finding better ways to teach german schoolchildren about the holocaust in an effort to increase their sensibilities .
but his efforts have fallen on deaf ears , he said . " i have n't gotten any reaction so far . "
cultural understanding is perhaps the most important tool politicians will have in dispelling israeli misconceptions about germany , said martin beck , middle eastern expert at the german institute for middle east studies , in hamburg . " the cultural relationship between germany and israel is perhaps more developed than any other european country has with israel , " said beck in an interview .
" that is very important .
an exchange on all levels , not just a political level , is crucial to dismantling israeli suspicion and to showing them that the germany of today has nothing to do with the germany of national socialism .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .

a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .

" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .

in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .
last year 's winner , the german film " head on , " about the struggles of a turkish couple in germany , has gone on to collect a clutch of international awards and has even attracted interest in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale director dieter kosslick " we do n't want to be the hottest festival , but the most pleasant and the most friendly one , " festival director dieter kosslick told a press conference .

" kinsey and " deep throat " the sex comes in the form of the us-german co-production " kinsey , " about the man regarded as the father of scientific research into human sexual behavior .
starring liam neeson and laura linney , " kinsey " will be the last of the competition films shown .
" inside deep throat , " meanwhile , supplies sex of a different kind , examining the cultural impact of the 1972 porn classic . soccer fans will doubtless enjoy the episodic " one day in europe , " in which football fans in russia , turkey , spain and germany fall prey to thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale begins on feb .
10 the berlinale will also maintain its customary special focus on african films .
the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

cet on wednesday following information given by disgraced referee robert hoyzer .
hoyzer has already admitted fixing up to four matches for financial gain and other officials , players and outside parties are also involved . " in total 25 people are suspected of playing a part in rigging soccer matches with players , referees and outside parties involved , " read the statement .
" along with robert hoyzer and the s. brothers -lrb- two unnamed croatian men arrested in berlin -rrb- referees jurgen jansen , felix zwayer and dominik marks are the accused . " " the people concerned are suspected of manipulating ten matches in the bundesliga , second division , the regional league and cup in 2004 , " the statement continued . bundesliga ref jansen under suspicion essen official jansen was due to officiate werder bremen 's match with hansa rostock on sunday but was removed for his own protection .
jansen is suspected of manipulating two matches with the first fixture between bayer leverkusen and fc st pauli in the 2001/02 campaign .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .
" that israel can live within internationally recognized borders , free from fear and terror , is an incontestable maxim of german politics . " " my country has always demonstrated this by its actions .
germany stands unswervingly side by side with israel and its people , " he said . lessons learnt from survivors must endure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler meets with ariel sharon before the speech in the knesset .
in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .
their recollections must not be lost , " he said . " the faces of the victims must not be forgotten .
we must ensure that the teachings of a generation will be passed on to the next generation .
and we must all grasp the fact that the victims of the shoah have given us a duty : to never allow genocide to happen again .
will we do justice to this duty ? " köhler vows to fight anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman passes by a jewish memorial , desecrated with nazi symbols , at a cemetery in dortmund , germany .
the german president also stressed that his country would be unstinting in its fight against anti-semitism and any effort to downplay the horrors of the holocaust in which at least six million jews were killed . " every open society also has enemies .
xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .
we must seek to oppose right-wing extremists and anti-semites through political means and we must do so aggressively . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon earlier told parliament that while he was delighted to play host to the german president , the grief of the holocaust would " endure forever " . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and israel far from normality forty years ago this month , germany and israel took up diplomatic relations for the first time since wwii .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .

around 812,000 tickets are available in the first phase . the website experienced some initial technical difficulties but did not crash despite the heavy demand , organizers said .
" the orders came flying in as soon as the starting whistle went , " said horst r. schmidt , who is responsible for ticketing in his role as senior vice-president of the organizing committee .
" fortunately , our technical system withstood the initial stampede and proved its reliability . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky few ?
in the internet sale , fans were restricted to four tickets per person for any individual match in the lower price categories with a maximum of seven tickets per person for all matches in the same category .
the tickets range in price from € 35 euros -lrb- $ 45.5 -rrb- to € 600 . fifa feared no technical collapse fifa officials seemed to be relishing the technical challenge of providing the world 's soccer fan base with one portal to buy tickets for the most sought after tournament seats in the game after the success of a similar procedure at the 2004 european championship in portugal . " we encourage people to buy over the internet , " said schmidt .
" those people who do n't have internet access should seek out a friend because it 's the easiest way . " the organizers stressed that the tickets ' bought ' in the first phase of sale until march 31 were effectively only applications because if , as seems certain , demand exceeds supply then tickets will not be distributed on a first come , first served basis but rather via a lottery .
in the second phase which runs from may 1 to november 15 this year , the first come , first served principle will apply . irate fans still have much to lament bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the apparent lack of teething problems on the first day of trading , german organizers are bracing themselves for a lot of angry people in the long run as demand is expected to massively outstrip the ticket supply . by the time the 32-nation line-up for the world cup is finalized there will be just 300,000 tickets , or 10 percent of the total , left for public sale .
the result being that many of the fans buying on line on tuesday night were ' buying blind ' with no way of knowing who would be the teams involved in the games they hoped to attend or they were buying the team specific ticket -lrb- tst -rrb- which allows them to follow their own side for several matches . these tickets also carry the risk because , as yet , only the german team is guaranteed a place at the finals . the tsts remain a gamble but fans will get their money back if their team fails to qualify or makes an early exit . fifa has made it clear that tickets returned at the last minute will not be resold .
the plan is to give them out to some of the 190,000 accredited drivers , caterers and other auxiliary workers who would not normally get to see a game .
taken as a whole , the ticket allocation is a lottery with continually dwindling chances of success . ticket numbers in fans ' best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , fifa and the tournament 's german organizing committee have assured the public that the number of tickets available has been calculated to provide the best experience for the fans . both the world soccer governing body and the germans are confident they have learned from the mistakes of south korea and japan four years ago , when there were banks of empty seats even at matches supposedly sold out .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .

but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 five million germans jobless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers will drop again , labor minister wolfgang clement said germany 's federal labor office on wednesday announced that for the first time since world war ii , more than five million people are unemployed .
but some experts say the numbers will begin to fall in the coming months . labor office officials said 5.037 million people were without a job in january - 537,000 more than in december .
while the increase is largely to blame on recent social welfare reform that re-classified welfare recipients as unemployed , there has already been fierce criticism of the government 's economic policy . opposition members are accusing chancellor gerhard schröder of concealing the real magnitude of the country 's unemployment .
the news that five million people can not find work is a serious problem for the chancellor , who took office with the pledge ot intending to drive joblessness below 3.5 million . in the fight against persistently high unemployment , schröder is now banking his political fortunes on a government-sponsored low-wage sector that combines one-euro-an-hour wages with welfare benefits .
next year ’ s general election could then be the chancellor ’ s moment of truth . government blames statistics but as news about the new figures leaked on tuesday , labor minister wolfgang clement was quick to explain the increase . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are now lining up at german labor offices to receive help " the reasons for that are the winter season as well as the fact that job placement activities by our labor office agents were substantially lower last month as a result of sweeping organisational changes , " he said .
" in addition there is a statistical effect as thousands of former welfare recipients will be counted as unemployed for the first time in the wake of our reforms . " experts believe that in addition to december ’ s four and a half million officially registered unemployed , there will be some 350,000 germans who lost their jobs due to the winter , and an estimated 300,000 people who had previously received social welfare without actually being enrolled at the labor office . a long-term problem franz müntefering , party leader of the ruling social democrats said the figures unveil what has so far been kept under wraps by successive governments - including those run by the conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " we are aiming to make a clean breast of things , " he said .
" we do not want to hide people in welfare statistics but give them a real chance to find employment again . " germany ’ s opposition liberals and conservatives , however , accuse the government of fiddling the figures .
they claim that in fact more than seven million germans are unemployed as a result of the government ’ s failing economic policy . labor minister wolfgang clement , however , hopes that the government ’ s social and economic reforms will be able to reduce unemployment by more than 200,000 this year . skepticism vs. trend reversal some economists , such as bert rürup , the new head of the government 's economic advisory council , are sceptical and say any positive effects of the reform could be offset by a worsening global economic climate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans still hesitate to spend money " the steep appreciation of the euro hasn ’ t been stopped , " rürup said , adding that and fears of a war in iran are bound to provoke oil price hikes .
" so i ’ m rather sceptical about government expectations , especially about a rise in domestic consumption which it says will spur on growth and employment here . " but others warned the government of reacting by trying to come up with short-term remedies .
klaus zimmermann , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , said he expected unemployment figures to drop by the summer . " that 's going to continue to happen in 2006 , " he told berliner zeitung .
" this means that the trend has been reversed .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .
" that israel can live within internationally recognized borders , free from fear and terror , is an incontestable maxim of german politics . " " my country has always demonstrated this by its actions .
germany stands unswervingly side by side with israel and its people , " he said . lessons learnt from survivors must endure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler meets with ariel sharon before the speech in the knesset .
in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .
their recollections must not be lost , " he said . " the faces of the victims must not be forgotten .
we must ensure that the teachings of a generation will be passed on to the next generation .
and we must all grasp the fact that the victims of the shoah have given us a duty : to never allow genocide to happen again .
will we do justice to this duty ? " köhler vows to fight anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman passes by a jewish memorial , desecrated with nazi symbols , at a cemetery in dortmund , germany .
the german president also stressed that his country would be unstinting in its fight against anti-semitism and any effort to downplay the horrors of the holocaust in which at least six million jews were killed . " every open society also has enemies .
xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .
we must seek to oppose right-wing extremists and anti-semites through political means and we must do so aggressively . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

" i want to underline that the responsibility for the shoah forms part of the german identity , " köhler told the knesset in his native tongue after a brief preamble in hebrew .
" that israel can live within internationally recognized borders , free from fear and terror , is an incontestable maxim of german politics . " " my country has always demonstrated this by its actions .
germany stands unswervingly side by side with israel and its people , " he said . lessons learnt from survivors must endure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler meets with ariel sharon before the speech in the knesset .
in a speech delivered just days after the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in poland , köhler stressed that germany would never forget the lessons of the past .
" what will happen when there are no survivors left ?
they must remain part of our present .
their recollections must not be lost , " he said . " the faces of the victims must not be forgotten .
we must ensure that the teachings of a generation will be passed on to the next generation .
and we must all grasp the fact that the victims of the shoah have given us a duty : to never allow genocide to happen again .
will we do justice to this duty ? " köhler vows to fight anti-semitism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman passes by a jewish memorial , desecrated with nazi symbols , at a cemetery in dortmund , germany .

xenophobia and anti-semitism have not disappeared from germany , " he said referring to a recent event in the state parliament of saxony where representatives from the right-wing npd party walked out during a moment of silence in honor of the victims of the holocaust .
the nationalist party had created a sensation by calling for replacing the tribute to the jewish victims with one honoring those germans who died during the allied air raid on dresden . " comparisons which try to play down the shoah are scandalous and we must oppose them .
we must seek to oppose right-wing extremists and anti-semites through political means and we must do so aggressively . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . more than 350 films will be showing at the february 10-21 festival known as the berlinale , including 21 productions competing for the prestigious golden bear award for best film . smith and reeves are two of the big hollywood names tentatively lined up to appear at the festival to sprinkle some stardust and promote their movies , which are rivals for best film .
in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .
last year 's winner , the german film " head on , " about the struggles of a turkish couple in germany , has gone on to collect a clutch of international awards and has even attracted interest in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale director dieter kosslick " we do n't want to be the hottest festival , but the most pleasant and the most friendly one , " festival director dieter kosslick told a press conference .

" kinsey and " deep throat " the sex comes in the form of the us-german co-production " kinsey , " about the man regarded as the father of scientific research into human sexual behavior .
starring liam neeson and laura linney , " kinsey " will be the last of the competition films shown .
" inside deep throat , " meanwhile , supplies sex of a different kind , examining the cultural impact of the 1972 porn classic . soccer fans will doubtless enjoy the episodic " one day in europe , " in which football fans in russia , turkey , spain and germany fall prey to thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale begins on feb .
10 the berlinale will also maintain its customary special focus on african films .
the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .
" it is very important that the political elite declare that gypsies are not foreign , that we have to help them to help themselves , " teleki said .
" if we do n't get enough empathy , enough support , then it wo n't work , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to honor roma killed by nazis germany is to commission a memorial to the estimated half a million roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- systematically murdered by the nazi regime during world war ii .

will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . more than 350 films will be showing at the february 10-21 festival known as the berlinale , including 21 productions competing for the prestigious golden bear award for best film . smith and reeves are two of the big hollywood names tentatively lined up to appear at the festival to sprinkle some stardust and promote their movies , which are rivals for best film .
in " hitch , " smith portrays a marriage broker with a gift for pairing ordinary joes with extraordinarily beautiful women , while reeves handles the descent into the hell of drug addiction in " thumbsucker . " while berlin makes no claim to influence the race for an oscar and ranks just below cannes and alongside venice in terms of prestige , winning the golden bear can propel european and international films to success around the world .
last year 's winner , the german film " head on , " about the struggles of a turkish couple in germany , has gone on to collect a clutch of international awards and has even attracted interest in the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale director dieter kosslick " we do n't want to be the hottest festival , but the most pleasant and the most friendly one , " festival director dieter kosslick told a press conference .
with germany currently gripped by the scandal of a referee who has admitted fixing football matches , kosslick tapped into the theme by claiming this year 's festival would feature " football , sex and politics . " kinsey and " deep throat " the sex comes in the form of the us-german co-production " kinsey , " about the man regarded as the father of scientific research into human sexual behavior .
starring liam neeson and laura linney , " kinsey " will be the last of the competition films shown .
" inside deep throat , " meanwhile , supplies sex of a different kind , examining the cultural impact of the 1972 porn classic . soccer fans will doubtless enjoy the episodic " one day in europe , " in which football fans in russia , turkey , spain and germany fall prey to thieves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale begins on feb .
10 the berlinale will also maintain its customary special focus on african films .
the us production " sometimes in april , " examining the 1984 genocide in rwanda , is entered in the competition .
another film about that country 's terrible civil war , " hotel rwanda , " will have its european premiere as an out-of-competition picture .
the barbarity inflicted on children kidnapped by rebels in the ongoing conflicts in sudan and uganda is put under the microscope in the documentary " lost children , " as this category goes from strength to strength , organizers said . running alongside the showings , a film market will take place with organizers expecting 2,500 foreign representatives from the industry in the german capital . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale jury complete chinese actress bai ling and italian fashion designer nino cerruti will feature in the seven-member jury selecting the golden bear award at this year 's berlinale film festival , according to organizers .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german organizations take stock of tsunami relief an endeavor that needs time and money german tsunami early warning system takes shape germany -pipe- 02.02.2005 indonesia imports german tsunami warning model großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both the german and us models rely on buoys and sensors indonesia has decided to install a tsunami early warning system developed by german researchers in potsdam who claim the technology is superior to the existing us model in the pacific . earlier this week news emerged that indonesia , the country worst-affected by the tsunami last december , had decided to go in for an early warning system developed by the geo research center in potsdam , germany .
according to the concept drawn up by the potsdam researchers , the early warning system would first be set up in indonesia and sri lanka .
later , the network could be expanded to cover the entire indian ocean region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of the potsdam geo-research center points to a map showing the location of the tsunami rolf emmerman , head of the potsdam-based research institute said the first stage of building the system is likely to cost around € 25 million , the total costs are pegged at € 45 million .
the first ocean buoys along the indian ocean coast will be laid as early as october this year , emmerman said .
he added that the system would then be up and running in another one and a half years and would be able to relay warnings via the internet , e-mail as well as via mobile text messages .
" i 'm surprised myself that things are proceeding so swiftly since we 're not having a conference until mid-march , " emmerman said .
the german research ministry is said to be poised to sign an agreement on the early warning system with jakarta during the march conference .
" and then we can go ahead . "
faster and more efficient according to german research minister edelgard bulmahn , one clear advantage of the german early warning system lies in the fact that it can be linked with other existing systems .
until now , there has only been one other tsunami early warning system in the pacific ocean operated by the us and japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tsunami buoy on the noaa ship " ronald h. brown " in the pacfic ocean .
both the german and the us systems basically work on the same principle : pressure sensors embedded in the ocean bed record every giant wave and every shudder of a seaquake via buoys and satellites to tsunami alarm centers on the coast .
there the data is processed and the population alarmed if there is a grave risk .
but , the crucial difference according to the potsdam researchers is that their model is faster and more efficient , thereby reducing the number of false alarms .
" in the american and japanese system in the pacific the process is simulated by a computer and thus the measurement of the quake usually takes much longer , " said emmerman .
" we think that what we 're offering is technologically better . "
peter herzig , director of the kiel-based leibnitz institute for oceanography which is also involved in the development of the tsunami early warning system , echoed that view .
" our pressure sensors work more reliably and can - in contrast to the pacific system - differentiate background noises of tsunami waves , " herzig said .
" with a combination of buoys and satellites equipped with gps -lrb- global positioning system -rrb- we can also observe the sea surface in real time and with exact precision , " he said .
the system thus enables experts to differentiate between fatal tsunami waves and other high waves .
unique software researchers also point out that a quick processing of data relayed by the underwater sensors is of paramount importance when it comes to warning threatened residents before tsunami waves that travel at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour hit land .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rogue wave aboard the supertanker esso languedoc , during a storm off durban in south africa in 1980 .
to counter the problem , emmerman said the potsdam institute had developed a unique software which would be installed in data stations in the affected countries .
the potsdam researchers already have a worldwide network with 50 measuring stations .
" we know in one or two minutes after an earthquake about its exact location and its force , " emmerman said .
this experience is expected to come in handy while setting up the early warning system .
however , experts remain clear that setting up a tsunami early warning system wo n't be enough . in the long-term , disaster management capabilities of countries need to be improved .
friedrich-wilhelm wellmer , director of the federal agency for geosciences and raw materials in hanover , said an important step would be to set up functioning information networks in the countries so that warnings could reach all threatened people , even fishermen in remote villages without access to radio , television or internet . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german scientist : tsunami warning possible eyewitnesses of the tsunamis that hit south asia following sunday 's underwater earthquake said the wall of water hit without warning , but a german seismologist said that , in principle , a warning was possible .

gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .
and for gypsy students who may have grown up speaking another language at home , the government has set up 103 classes to learn czech for one year before starting primary school . bulgaria , which is slated to join the eu in 2007 , has pledged to raise employment rates among gypsies .
a survey there in november found 89 percent of gypsies said they would rather have jobs than rely on social assistance .
the study also found one out of two gypsy households was on the welfare rolls in bulgaria , while every third family relied almost entirely on social benefits to make ends meet . gypsies are local however , gypsy leaders have warned that the ambitious plans to improve lives do not always translate into practical benefits . in croatia , gypsy leaders complain that resources to fund health , housing and other projects were misallocated or never reached the targeted areas .
" the projects only exist on paper , " said alija mesic , a leader of an umbrella organization grouping 28 gypsy associations .
" the government estimated that the projects needed € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 3.25 million -rrb- for 2004 but only one percent of that sum was allocated , " he said . nevertheless , the meeting in sofia on wednesday is a hopeful sign for some that gypsy issues will be taken more seriously .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.02.2005 efforts to integrate gypsies gather speed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's sinti and roma often face discrimination ambitious plans are afoot in central and eastern europe to integrate gypsies , or sinti and roma - one of the continent 's largest ethnic minorities - into mainstream society within a decade . the plans , which include ending the segregation of gypsies in schools and eradicating all-gypsy ramshackle housing projects , are part of national action plans worked out in eight of the region 's countries , whose leaders meet in sofia , bulgaria , on wednesday to discuss sinti and roma integration .
gypsy leaders say these programs , already underway in some countries , could mark a new beginning in efforts to integrate gypsies , who number up to 10 million in europe according to some estimates , mostly living in central and eastern europe . " for the first time government budgets will allocate resources to begin the eradication of up to 700 all-gypsy housing projects which have no utilities and to move those living there into decent housing over the next 10 years , " laszlo teleki , state secretary in charge of roma affairs in hungary and himself a gypsy , told afp .
he said that another hungarian project would aim to end the segregation of gypsies in 700 schools nationwide . efforts are concentrated on vital areas such as education , housing and employment in new european union member states - the czech republic , hungary and slovakia - and other countries - bulgaria and romania - which hope to join the eu in the future .
poverty and unemployment rates among gypsies are up to 10 times higher than those of the general population , while education levels are far inferior , with many gypsies dropping out before finishing primary school . special attention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the czech republic , the authorities have started to abolish " special " primary schools filled with gypsies who receive a low-standard education , where many pupils are considered mentally handicapped .
to help with the integration of gypsy students , prague has appointed more than 250 gypsy educational assistants .

the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china .
the deal sees rosneft receive $ 6bn in credits from china 's cnpc .
litigation according to russian newspaper vedomosti , these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft obtained to finance the purchase of yugansk .
reports said cnpc had been offered 20 % of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead .

once the country 's richest man , mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion .
forward security the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china 's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy .

the kremlin said on tuesday that the $ 6bn which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks .
the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china .
the deal sees rosneft receive $ 6bn in credits from china 's cnpc .
litigation according to russian newspaper vedomosti , these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft obtained to finance the purchase of yugansk .
reports said cnpc had been offered 20 % of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead .
analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos , yugansk 's former owner , if cnpc had become a shareholder .
rosneft and veb declined to comment .
" the two companies -lsb- rosneft and cnpc -rsb- have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries , " said russian oil official sergei oganesyan .
" there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years . "
sale the announcements help to explain how rosneft , a medium-sized , indebted , and relatively unknown firm , was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk .
yugansk was sold for $ 9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $ 27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines .
clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage dmitry lukashov , aton analyst the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm .
but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft .

the gwyniad , which dates back to the ice age and is described as similar to a herring , lives in llyn tegid near bala .
conservationists fear they could be wiped out by pollution , disease or by another fish already in the lake .
efforts are now under way to move some of the fish to the nearby llyn arenig .
arwel morris , lake warden at llyn tegid , said they hoped the gwyniad , or coregonus lavaretus , would thrive in their new home although nothing was being taken for granted .
" we ca n't be certain , but the quality of the lake is the same as here at llyn tegid , " he said .
the gwyniad eggs are then released into llyn arenig along with the countryside council for wales and the environment agency , conservationists are gathering fish at night , extracting their eggs and fertilising them before introducing them to the other lake .
" the idea is to net the lake during evening hours after dusk - we go out about five or six times , netting and hopefully getting the stock we need , " said mr morris .
he added that the fish 's precarious existence at the lake had been compounded by the introduction of another fish into the lake in the early 1980s .
" the ruffe ... is known to eat a lot of the gwyniad eggs , " he said .

conservationists fear they could be wiped out by pollution , disease or by another fish already in the lake .
efforts are now under way to move some of the fish to the nearby llyn arenig .
arwel morris , lake warden at llyn tegid , said they hoped the gwyniad , or coregonus lavaretus , would thrive in their new home although nothing was being taken for granted .
" we ca n't be certain , but the quality of the lake is the same as here at llyn tegid , " he said .

" the idea is to net the lake during evening hours after dusk - we go out about five or six times , netting and hopefully getting the stock we need , " said mr morris .
he added that the fish 's precarious existence at the lake had been compounded by the introduction of another fish into the lake in the early 1980s .

" in spite of the attempts to resolve the dispute on the alliance 's outstanding financial and industrial issues , no agreement has been reached , " fiat said in a statement .
a gm spokesman reiterated that the company believed the put option had been invalidated by restructuring moves which changed the shape of fiat auto .
" fiat reasserts its view that the put option is valid , enforceable in accordance with its terms and an important asset for the group .
the put is exercisable from today , " fiat said .
fiat gained the right to sell its car division to gm as part of an alliance agreed in 2000 .
gm , whose own european operations are losing money , no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit .
it has argued the deal was voided by fiat 's decision to sell off its finance arm and halve gm 's stake via a capital-raising effort .
the 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat .
the german firm wanted to buy fiat outright .
changed circumstances but gianni agnelli , the former head of the group , wanted to keep control , and preferred gm 's offer to buy a 20 % stake and give fiat the right to sell in the future , known as a " put option " .
since then , however , fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses , while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut gm 's stake in half to 10 % .
for its part , gm 's european units opel and saab have both had trouble , with opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs .
" the last thing they need is additional production capacity in europe , " said patrick juchemich , auto analyst at sal oppenheim bank .

dr andrew holton was suspended after he prescribed the wrong treatment to hundreds of patients in the late 1990s .
the general medical council launched an inquiry more than three years ago , but has still not set a date for a hearing .
a parents group says the case " should be given top priority rather than being pushed to the back of the queue " .
' little progress ' trevor parr of the leicester epilepsy concerned parents and carers group said : " it is sad that after four years so little progress has been made . "
dr holton was working as consultant neurologist at the leicester royal infirmary in 2000 when he was investigated for misdiagnosing more than 600 children as epileptic and prescribed potentially damaging medication .
" the gmc is only dealing with 12 complainants out of the many hundreds that could have been presented , " mr parr said .
" they have given us a series of dates but they appear to keep changing their minds and the dates . "
the gmc declined to issue a statement as the inquiry is ongoing , but confirmed that no date has yet been set for the hearing .
mr parr said dr holton has been retrained and may be working again but his details are not on the gmc website .
a report by an independent nhs inquiry team in 2003 found complaints were first made about dr holton , who worked at the leicester royal infirmary , almost three years before he was suspended .
dr holton was suspended on full pay in may 2001 , but later left the university hospitals of leicester nhs trust .
