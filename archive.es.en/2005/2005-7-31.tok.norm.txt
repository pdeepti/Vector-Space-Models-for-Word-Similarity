the french state is trying to change the situation - with mixed results . the government argues that living in polygamy prevents immigrants from becoming integrated into french society and that it goes against the principles of gender equality enshrined in the constitution .
polygamy was made illegal in france in 1993 .
those who still live in polygamy have either been doing so since before the law was passed or they married abroad . though polygamy is n't very common in the northern paris suburb of cergy , most people in the african community there seem to know at least one polygamous family , usually with roots in mali . " i 'm against polygamy , even though i 'm african , " explained kofi jumeau , who , along with his 43 brothers and sisters , could speak from first-hand experience .
" my father had between nine and 11 wives .
and unfortunately it really hurt us kids , because there was no family cohesion .
it was really bad for us . " the french authorities employ a strategy they call " de-cohabitation " to reduce the numbers of polygamous households .
it involves social workers helping second and third wives move into separate apartments with their children , breaking up the polygamous arrangement .
a personal issue mamalea bapuwa is an intercultural mediator at the association of african women , one of the groups that helps women want to leave polygamous homes . " it 's a question of choice , " she explained . " we ca n't push people in this direction .
once a woman has made up her mind and has decided she wants to de-cohabitate , she comes to see us . " the government offers women large , subsidized apartments to encourage them to leave polygamous families .
they may also receive the 10-year-residence permits issued to other foreign residents .
polygamous families are only eligible for permits that must be renewed every year , which can make it difficult to find a job or travel internationally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from mali to france fatima camara , 39 , is a mother of five and the second wife in a polygamous marriage .
she was living in mali with her family when her cousin came to visit from france in 1987 .
he was already married , but camara 's family told her to marry him anyway , as is the custom in many muslim communities in mali . " i could n't really say no to my parents .
so i said , that i would agree to whatever they decided .
we went ahead with the marriage , " camara , who lives in cergy , said .
13 people in three rooms she said that things worked out wonderfully until her children became older .
but three adults and 10 children in a three-room apartment grew increasingly more difficult to handle . camara finally moved into a six-room apartment she was assigned in the spring of 2004 .
but she continues to live in semi-polygamy ; her husband and the children belonging to his first wife come over every day .
and she 's happy with the set-up . " i like living in a polygamous family .
we are n't alone .
we can discuss our problems .
there are a lot of things i like , " she said . the french government , however , wants camara to go a step further - to divorce her husband .
only then , would she receive a 10-year residence permit .
but camara would rather be forced to renew her permit every year .
she says she loves her husband and wants to stay married to him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no official national statistics on the number of polygamous families who have been separated .
but a government agency that oversees housing in the paris region says that of the roughly 500 families known to be living in polygamy in the area , only 81 women have moved out in the past five years , and 24 of them have divorced their husbands .
many more polygamous families are thought to be living in the shadows .
taking action parliamentarian chantal brunel has taken up the issue and would like the government to be more aggressive in dealing with it .
" i think we have to send a strong message to other countries and to foreigners who live here and do n't respect the laws on our soil .
polygamy is completely illegal in france , and yet it exists . " brunel sponsored legislation last year calling for state tutors to manage the welfare benefits of polygamous families .
though the bill did n't pass , she did manage to draw attention to the issue of polygamy and continued to lobby her colleagues for more action in tackling it .
there 's now a growing sense that france 's current policy is n't working , and that the country needs to take a tougher stance if it wants polygamy to become a thing of the past . genevieve oger -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tackling the birth-rate problem sandwiched between short-term unemployment woes and steadily declining birth rates , germany has only gradually set about tackling its population problems .

a member of the alleged july 21 cell , fighting extradition from rome , denied he had links to osama bin laden 's al qaeda terror group and said the attacks were " just a gesture . " at least three men wanted over the attacks were being interrogated by police in london .
britain was also seeking access to the reported ringleader of the july 7 blasts , british national haroon aswat , who was arrested in zambia on july 20 . the sunday times said a third terror cell was planning multiple suicide bomb attacks on london .
the weekly said they were on the loose and planning further blasts on " soft " targets like the underground subway network .
the newspaper said intelligence of a third cell with access to explosives and plans to hit london was known to british police , who have not retracted from friday 's statement , " the threat remains and is very real . " the group was said to be independent of the previous bombers but members were associated with some of the suspects nabbed over the july 21 attacks . a metropolitan police firearms officer told the newspaper arrests so far were " just the tip of the iceberg .
" there is some big stuff coming in the next few months .
there 's a big network that 's got to be cracked . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in italian custody : osman hussain suspect bomber osman hussain -lrb- photo -rrb- has begun making revelations about the july 21 incidents .
the alleged attempted bomber of an underground train at shepherd 's bush station , in custody in rome , denied links with al qaeda , the italian news agency ansa reported , quoting records of the interrogation .
" just a gesture " " i have no connection with al qaeda , " hussain - also known as issac hamdi - told italian magistrates after his arrest .
" i joined a muscle-building class in notting hill -lrb- west london -rrb- and i was told we had to act to avenge our people who had been arrested , thrown into prison after the july 7 bombings , " the ethiopian-born naturalized briton said .
" a signal had to be given and we did it , but we did not intend to kill anybody .
it was just a gesture , " he declared , adding that he had no links with the four july 7 suicide bombers . italian justice ministry sources said supporting documentation required for extradition in the case of suspects held under the new european arrest warrant is expected from british police monday .
the new arrest warrant , ratified by the italian parliament in april , has streamlined extradition procedures between european union states and could mean the hussain could be handed over within days . if the subject of the warrant refuses extradition the country where he or she is held has 60 days , extendable by a further 30 , to make a decision . " terrorist goldmine " a british sunday newspaper revealed a bag feared to have been meant to aid further bombers enter and exit britain was found abandoned by london 's main heathrow airport , stuffed with fake passports , documents and bank cards .
the news of the world called the find a " potential terrorist goldmine . "
the 19 passports inside were for pakistani , british , indian , nepalese and south african nationals .
the bag also contained a letter written to a muslim in dewsbury , northern england - home to july 7 suicide bomber mohammed sidique khan .
mastermind arrested in zambia ? zambian police confirmed saturday that aswat was arrested on july 20 in lusaka .
the british foreign office has said it is seeking access to a man being held by the zambian authorities . " his arrest follows ongoing security investigations on the threat of terrorism to which mr aswat is alleged to be connected , " zambian police inspector general ephraim maateyo said in a statement .
" he entered the country on july 6 .
he is a british national and is currently in custody of zambian security authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police officers cordon off the scene of a police raid in an apartment block in west london , friday a total of 11 suspects were still in british custody over the two waves of london bomb attacks .

" we had given them a chance until midday -lrb- 0730 gmt -rrb- , but -lrb- eu foreign policy chief javier -rrb- solana has not announced any decision , " he told iranian state television , according to reuters news service .
" in the next half hour we will hand a letter to the un nuclear agency saying we will restart activities today , " he added .
the move has raised the stakes in the nuclear standoff and risks seeing iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions , a persistent demand of the united states which accuses iran of seeking atomic weapons .
the uranium conversion process , carried out in iran at a facility in the central city of isfahan , changes uranium ore into the uranium gas that is the feedstock for enrichment .
iran agreed in november to suspend uranium enrichment activities , a process that makes fuel for civilian nuclear power plants but can also be the explosive core of atom bombs , during negotiations with the europeans . the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany is preparing a package of trade , technology and security incentives in return for iran guaranteeing its nuclear program is peaceful .
a right to enrichment ? tehran insists it has the right to enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and the issue has been one of the chief stumbling blocks in the process with the europeans .

as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide . while beer is beloved throughout germany , most people associate the malt beverage with big bavarian men wearing lederhosen and green felt hats decorated with bushy brushes served a stein of amber brew by a big woman wearing a dirndl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's a common picture at germany 's largest beer garden , the octoberfest in munich should you make it to bavaria and finally utter those words you spent hours learning from a beginning german cassette , " ein bier bitte , " you will receive a large glass mug of helles , or lager beer .
it is n't as hoppy as your standard pilsner , hence it can go down quickly .
the mug itself is a standard feature of munich 's beer gardens and you will hardly find it anywhere north of the main river .
if you are looking for something more unusual , go to düsseldorf .
the city on the rhine river is about the only place you can order an alt .
it 's dark in color and bitter in flavor , the second attribute of which is particularly useful on a hot summer day .
trademark beer the opposite of the large beer mug in bavaria is cologne 's stange , a tall , thin glass that holds 0.2 liters -lrb- 0.4 pints -rrb- of kölsch .
ordering one of these in düsseldorf , a mere 35 kilometers away -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- could result in a small run-in with the bar staff and customers who wo n't take kindly to the light-colored beer from the rival city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your typical " stange " from cologne one of the nicer traditions of drinking in a cologne pub is the so-called köbes , your waiter .
the kobeses are notorious for continually replacing empty beer glass with full ones regardless of guests ' requests to the contrary .
traditionally , a kölsch could only be called that if the 157-meter -lrb- 515-foot -rrb- high spires of the city 's cathedral could be seen from the brewery .
even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .
mixing with beer popular one of germany 's most popular beers is not a true beer at all - or at least not 100 percent beer .
the " berliner weisse " is a favorite summer drink in the german capital .
there are two versions , one with the addition of raspberry syrup , the other with waldmeister syrup , which comes from the woodruff plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has been known to enjoy a beer in the summer especially , germans get their refreshment by mixing beer with sodas .
radler and alsterwasser are the most popular mixes , made up of half beer and half sprite or orange soda -lrb- fanta -rrb- .
cola mixes are also widespread .
yet if beer to you means just a bitter tasting malt beverage that should never be tainted with sugary sodas , bamberg 's rauchbier , or smoke beer , made with smoked barley malt , may be just what you 're looking for .
if all you really want is a big kick , you might try a donnerbock , or thunder bock , with alcohol content of 13 percent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de which bud 's for europe ?

a member of the alleged july 21 cell , fighting extradition from rome , denied he had links to osama bin laden 's al qaeda terror group and said the attacks were " just a gesture . " at least three men wanted over the attacks were being interrogated by police in london .
britain was also seeking access to the reported ringleader of the july 7 blasts , british national haroon aswat , who was arrested in zambia on july 20 . the sunday times said a third terror cell was planning multiple suicide bomb attacks on london .
the weekly said they were on the loose and planning further blasts on " soft " targets like the underground subway network .
the newspaper said intelligence of a third cell with access to explosives and plans to hit london was known to british police , who have not retracted from friday 's statement , " the threat remains and is very real . " the group was said to be independent of the previous bombers but members were associated with some of the suspects nabbed over the july 21 attacks . a metropolitan police firearms officer told the newspaper arrests so far were " just the tip of the iceberg .
" there is some big stuff coming in the next few months .
there 's a big network that 's got to be cracked . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in italian custody : osman hussain suspect bomber osman hussain -lrb- photo -rrb- has begun making revelations about the july 21 incidents .
the alleged attempted bomber of an underground train at shepherd 's bush station , in custody in rome , denied links with al qaeda , the italian news agency ansa reported , quoting records of the interrogation .
" just a gesture " " i have no connection with al qaeda , " hussain - also known as issac hamdi - told italian magistrates after his arrest .
" i joined a muscle-building class in notting hill -lrb- west london -rrb- and i was told we had to act to avenge our people who had been arrested , thrown into prison after the july 7 bombings , " the ethiopian-born naturalized briton said .
" a signal had to be given and we did it , but we did not intend to kill anybody .
it was just a gesture , " he declared , adding that he had no links with the four july 7 suicide bombers . italian justice ministry sources said supporting documentation required for extradition in the case of suspects held under the new european arrest warrant is expected from british police monday .
the new arrest warrant , ratified by the italian parliament in april , has streamlined extradition procedures between european union states and could mean the hussain could be handed over within days . if the subject of the warrant refuses extradition the country where he or she is held has 60 days , extendable by a further 30 , to make a decision . " terrorist goldmine " a british sunday newspaper revealed a bag feared to have been meant to aid further bombers enter and exit britain was found abandoned by london 's main heathrow airport , stuffed with fake passports , documents and bank cards .
the news of the world called the find a " potential terrorist goldmine . "
the 19 passports inside were for pakistani , british , indian , nepalese and south african nationals .
the bag also contained a letter written to a muslim in dewsbury , northern england - home to july 7 suicide bomber mohammed sidique khan .
mastermind arrested in zambia ? zambian police confirmed saturday that aswat was arrested on july 20 in lusaka .
the british foreign office has said it is seeking access to a man being held by the zambian authorities . " his arrest follows ongoing security investigations on the threat of terrorism to which mr aswat is alleged to be connected , " zambian police inspector general ephraim maateyo said in a statement .
" he entered the country on july 6 .

a member of the alleged july 21 cell , fighting extradition from rome , denied he had links to osama bin laden 's al qaeda terror group and said the attacks were " just a gesture . " at least three men wanted over the attacks were being interrogated by police in london .
britain was also seeking access to the reported ringleader of the july 7 blasts , british national haroon aswat , who was arrested in zambia on july 20 . the sunday times said a third terror cell was planning multiple suicide bomb attacks on london .
the weekly said they were on the loose and planning further blasts on " soft " targets like the underground subway network .
the newspaper said intelligence of a third cell with access to explosives and plans to hit london was known to british police , who have not retracted from friday 's statement , " the threat remains and is very real . " the group was said to be independent of the previous bombers but members were associated with some of the suspects nabbed over the july 21 attacks . a metropolitan police firearms officer told the newspaper arrests so far were " just the tip of the iceberg .
" there is some big stuff coming in the next few months .
there 's a big network that 's got to be cracked . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in italian custody : osman hussain suspect bomber osman hussain -lrb- photo -rrb- has begun making revelations about the july 21 incidents .
the alleged attempted bomber of an underground train at shepherd 's bush station , in custody in rome , denied links with al qaeda , the italian news agency ansa reported , quoting records of the interrogation .
" just a gesture " " i have no connection with al qaeda , " hussain - also known as issac hamdi - told italian magistrates after his arrest .
" i joined a muscle-building class in notting hill -lrb- west london -rrb- and i was told we had to act to avenge our people who had been arrested , thrown into prison after the july 7 bombings , " the ethiopian-born naturalized briton said .
" a signal had to be given and we did it , but we did not intend to kill anybody .
it was just a gesture , " he declared , adding that he had no links with the four july 7 suicide bombers . italian justice ministry sources said supporting documentation required for extradition in the case of suspects held under the new european arrest warrant is expected from british police monday .
the new arrest warrant , ratified by the italian parliament in april , has streamlined extradition procedures between european union states and could mean the hussain could be handed over within days . if the subject of the warrant refuses extradition the country where he or she is held has 60 days , extendable by a further 30 , to make a decision . " terrorist goldmine " a british sunday newspaper revealed a bag feared to have been meant to aid further bombers enter and exit britain was found abandoned by london 's main heathrow airport , stuffed with fake passports , documents and bank cards .
the news of the world called the find a " potential terrorist goldmine . "
the 19 passports inside were for pakistani , british , indian , nepalese and south african nationals .
the bag also contained a letter written to a muslim in dewsbury , northern england - home to july 7 suicide bomber mohammed sidique khan .
mastermind arrested in zambia ? zambian police confirmed saturday that aswat was arrested on july 20 in lusaka .
the british foreign office has said it is seeking access to a man being held by the zambian authorities . " his arrest follows ongoing security investigations on the threat of terrorism to which mr aswat is alleged to be connected , " zambian police inspector general ephraim maateyo said in a statement .
" he entered the country on july 6 .
he is a british national and is currently in custody of zambian security authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police officers cordon off the scene of a police raid in an apartment block in west london , friday a total of 11 suspects were still in british custody over the two waves of london bomb attacks .
twenty-eight people had been arrested altogether by british police in the terror investigations , the metropolitan police revealed saturday . reports said the girlfriends of july 21 bombing suspects ibrahim and mohammed were the two women arrested friday fleeing a bag check at london 's liverpool street railway terminus .
british newspapers said the pair were heading for london stanstead airport .
the sunday mirror quoted a security source as saying the two , released without charge friday , were now being treated as witnesses rather than suspects . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police grill suspected london bombers the four arrested fugitives from the botched july 21 london bomb attacks faced intense questioning as police were feted saturday for seizing them .

" we had given them a chance until midday -lrb- 0730 gmt -rrb- , but -lrb- eu foreign policy chief javier -rrb- solana has not announced any decision , " he told iranian state television , according to reuters news service .
" in the next half hour we will hand a letter to the un nuclear agency saying we will restart activities today , " he added .
the move has raised the stakes in the nuclear standoff and risks seeing iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions , a persistent demand of the united states which accuses iran of seeking atomic weapons .
the uranium conversion process , carried out in iran at a facility in the central city of isfahan , changes uranium ore into the uranium gas that is the feedstock for enrichment .
iran agreed in november to suspend uranium enrichment activities , a process that makes fuel for civilian nuclear power plants but can also be the explosive core of atom bombs , during negotiations with the europeans . the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany is preparing a package of trade , technology and security incentives in return for iran guaranteeing its nuclear program is peaceful .
a right to enrichment ? tehran insists it has the right to enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and the issue has been one of the chief stumbling blocks in the process with the europeans .
and outgoing reformist president mohammad khatami said last week that iran would resume enrichment activities no matter what the europeans propose although " we prefer to do it with their agreement .

a member of the alleged july 21 cell , fighting extradition from rome , denied he had links to osama bin laden 's al qaeda terror group and said the attacks were " just a gesture . " at least three men wanted over the attacks were being interrogated by police in london .
britain was also seeking access to the reported ringleader of the july 7 blasts , british national haroon aswat , who was arrested in zambia on july 20 . the sunday times said a third terror cell was planning multiple suicide bomb attacks on london .
the weekly said they were on the loose and planning further blasts on " soft " targets like the underground subway network .
the newspaper said intelligence of a third cell with access to explosives and plans to hit london was known to british police , who have not retracted from friday 's statement , " the threat remains and is very real . " the group was said to be independent of the previous bombers but members were associated with some of the suspects nabbed over the july 21 attacks . a metropolitan police firearms officer told the newspaper arrests so far were " just the tip of the iceberg .
" there is some big stuff coming in the next few months .

" just a gesture " " i have no connection with al qaeda , " hussain - also known as issac hamdi - told italian magistrates after his arrest .
" i joined a muscle-building class in notting hill -lrb- west london -rrb- and i was told we had to act to avenge our people who had been arrested , thrown into prison after the july 7 bombings , " the ethiopian-born naturalized briton said .
" a signal had to be given and we did it , but we did not intend to kill anybody .
it was just a gesture , " he declared , adding that he had no links with the four july 7 suicide bombers . italian justice ministry sources said supporting documentation required for extradition in the case of suspects held under the new european arrest warrant is expected from british police monday .
the new arrest warrant , ratified by the italian parliament in april , has streamlined extradition procedures between european union states and could mean the hussain could be handed over within days . if the subject of the warrant refuses extradition the country where he or she is held has 60 days , extendable by a further 30 , to make a decision . " terrorist goldmine " a british sunday newspaper revealed a bag feared to have been meant to aid further bombers enter and exit britain was found abandoned by london 's main heathrow airport , stuffed with fake passports , documents and bank cards .
the news of the world called the find a " potential terrorist goldmine . "
the 19 passports inside were for pakistani , british , indian , nepalese and south african nationals .
the bag also contained a letter written to a muslim in dewsbury , northern england - home to july 7 suicide bomber mohammed sidique khan .
mastermind arrested in zambia ? zambian police confirmed saturday that aswat was arrested on july 20 in lusaka .
the british foreign office has said it is seeking access to a man being held by the zambian authorities . " his arrest follows ongoing security investigations on the threat of terrorism to which mr aswat is alleged to be connected , " zambian police inspector general ephraim maateyo said in a statement .
" he entered the country on july 6 .
he is a british national and is currently in custody of zambian security authorities .

twenty-eight people had been arrested altogether by british police in the terror investigations , the metropolitan police revealed saturday . reports said the girlfriends of july 21 bombing suspects ibrahim and mohammed were the two women arrested friday fleeing a bag check at london 's liverpool street railway terminus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2005 in the land of beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians drink more beer than milk a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .
as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide . while beer is beloved throughout germany , most people associate the malt beverage with big bavarian men wearing lederhosen and green felt hats decorated with bushy brushes served a stein of amber brew by a big woman wearing a dirndl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's a common picture at germany 's largest beer garden , the octoberfest in munich should you make it to bavaria and finally utter those words you spent hours learning from a beginning german cassette , " ein bier bitte , " you will receive a large glass mug of helles , or lager beer .
it is n't as hoppy as your standard pilsner , hence it can go down quickly .
the mug itself is a standard feature of munich 's beer gardens and you will hardly find it anywhere north of the main river .
if you are looking for something more unusual , go to düsseldorf .
the city on the rhine river is about the only place you can order an alt .
it 's dark in color and bitter in flavor , the second attribute of which is particularly useful on a hot summer day .
trademark beer the opposite of the large beer mug in bavaria is cologne 's stange , a tall , thin glass that holds 0.2 liters -lrb- 0.4 pints -rrb- of kölsch .
ordering one of these in düsseldorf , a mere 35 kilometers away -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- could result in a small run-in with the bar staff and customers who wo n't take kindly to the light-colored beer from the rival city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your typical " stange " from cologne one of the nicer traditions of drinking in a cologne pub is the so-called köbes , your waiter .
the kobeses are notorious for continually replacing empty beer glass with full ones regardless of guests ' requests to the contrary .
traditionally , a kölsch could only be called that if the 157-meter -lrb- 515-foot -rrb- high spires of the city 's cathedral could be seen from the brewery .
even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .
mixing with beer popular one of germany 's most popular beers is not a true beer at all - or at least not 100 percent beer .
the " berliner weisse " is a favorite summer drink in the german capital .
there are two versions , one with the addition of raspberry syrup , the other with waldmeister syrup , which comes from the woodruff plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has been known to enjoy a beer in the summer especially , germans get their refreshment by mixing beer with sodas .
radler and alsterwasser are the most popular mixes , made up of half beer and half sprite or orange soda -lrb- fanta -rrb- .
cola mixes are also widespread .
yet if beer to you means just a bitter tasting malt beverage that should never be tainted with sugary sodas , bamberg 's rauchbier , or smoke beer , made with smoked barley malt , may be just what you 're looking for .
if all you really want is a big kick , you might try a donnerbock , or thunder bock , with alcohol content of 13 percent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de which bud 's for europe ?

a collection of articles on the topic .
experts warn about powdered alcohol just as youth advocates hail the fact that sales of " alcopops , " sweet drinks containing alcohol , are declining among kids , another product is raising concerns - alcopops in powder form , which are growing in popularity .

as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide . while beer is beloved throughout germany , most people associate the malt beverage with big bavarian men wearing lederhosen and green felt hats decorated with bushy brushes served a stein of amber brew by a big woman wearing a dirndl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's a common picture at germany 's largest beer garden , the octoberfest in munich should you make it to bavaria and finally utter those words you spent hours learning from a beginning german cassette , " ein bier bitte , " you will receive a large glass mug of helles , or lager beer .
it is n't as hoppy as your standard pilsner , hence it can go down quickly .
the mug itself is a standard feature of munich 's beer gardens and you will hardly find it anywhere north of the main river .
if you are looking for something more unusual , go to düsseldorf .
the city on the rhine river is about the only place you can order an alt .
it 's dark in color and bitter in flavor , the second attribute of which is particularly useful on a hot summer day .
trademark beer the opposite of the large beer mug in bavaria is cologne 's stange , a tall , thin glass that holds 0.2 liters -lrb- 0.4 pints -rrb- of kölsch .
ordering one of these in düsseldorf , a mere 35 kilometers away -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- could result in a small run-in with the bar staff and customers who wo n't take kindly to the light-colored beer from the rival city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your typical " stange " from cologne one of the nicer traditions of drinking in a cologne pub is the so-called köbes , your waiter .
the kobeses are notorious for continually replacing empty beer glass with full ones regardless of guests ' requests to the contrary .
traditionally , a kölsch could only be called that if the 157-meter -lrb- 515-foot -rrb- high spires of the city 's cathedral could be seen from the brewery .
even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .
mixing with beer popular one of germany 's most popular beers is not a true beer at all - or at least not 100 percent beer .
the " berliner weisse " is a favorite summer drink in the german capital .
there are two versions , one with the addition of raspberry syrup , the other with waldmeister syrup , which comes from the woodruff plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has been known to enjoy a beer in the summer especially , germans get their refreshment by mixing beer with sodas .
radler and alsterwasser are the most popular mixes , made up of half beer and half sprite or orange soda -lrb- fanta -rrb- .
cola mixes are also widespread .
yet if beer to you means just a bitter tasting malt beverage that should never be tainted with sugary sodas , bamberg 's rauchbier , or smoke beer , made with smoked barley malt , may be just what you 're looking for .
if all you really want is a big kick , you might try a donnerbock , or thunder bock , with alcohol content of 13 percent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de which bud 's for europe ?

" we had given them a chance until midday -lrb- 0730 gmt -rrb- , but -lrb- eu foreign policy chief javier -rrb- solana has not announced any decision , " he told iranian state television , according to reuters news service .
" in the next half hour we will hand a letter to the un nuclear agency saying we will restart activities today , " he added .
the move has raised the stakes in the nuclear standoff and risks seeing iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions , a persistent demand of the united states which accuses iran of seeking atomic weapons .
the uranium conversion process , carried out in iran at a facility in the central city of isfahan , changes uranium ore into the uranium gas that is the feedstock for enrichment .
iran agreed in november to suspend uranium enrichment activities , a process that makes fuel for civilian nuclear power plants but can also be the explosive core of atom bombs , during negotiations with the europeans . the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany is preparing a package of trade , technology and security incentives in return for iran guaranteeing its nuclear program is peaceful .
a right to enrichment ? tehran insists it has the right to enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and the issue has been one of the chief stumbling blocks in the process with the europeans .
and outgoing reformist president mohammad khatami said last week that iran would resume enrichment activities no matter what the europeans propose although " we prefer to do it with their agreement . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council washington accuses its iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by the islamic republic , and the negotiation process with the eu is aimed at avoiding tehran being brought before the security council .
eu concerned but the eu-3 is " warning about the consequences of breaking the suspension and that this will lead to the matter being taken to the un security council , " one diplomat told afp in vienna , the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-elect mahmoud ahmadinejad , speaks to the media , during his first news conference since being elected on friday , in the city council building in tehran , iran , sunday , june 26 , 2005 .
the ultraconservative ahmadinejad has vowed to pursue a peaceful nuclear program and said iran does n't need america to make progress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2005 in the land of beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians drink more beer than milk a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .
as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide . while beer is beloved throughout germany , most people associate the malt beverage with big bavarian men wearing lederhosen and green felt hats decorated with bushy brushes served a stein of amber brew by a big woman wearing a dirndl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's a common picture at germany 's largest beer garden , the octoberfest in munich should you make it to bavaria and finally utter those words you spent hours learning from a beginning german cassette , " ein bier bitte , " you will receive a large glass mug of helles , or lager beer .
it is n't as hoppy as your standard pilsner , hence it can go down quickly .
the mug itself is a standard feature of munich 's beer gardens and you will hardly find it anywhere north of the main river .
if you are looking for something more unusual , go to düsseldorf .
the city on the rhine river is about the only place you can order an alt .
it 's dark in color and bitter in flavor , the second attribute of which is particularly useful on a hot summer day .
trademark beer the opposite of the large beer mug in bavaria is cologne 's stange , a tall , thin glass that holds 0.2 liters -lrb- 0.4 pints -rrb- of kölsch .
ordering one of these in düsseldorf , a mere 35 kilometers away -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- could result in a small run-in with the bar staff and customers who wo n't take kindly to the light-colored beer from the rival city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your typical " stange " from cologne one of the nicer traditions of drinking in a cologne pub is the so-called köbes , your waiter .
the kobeses are notorious for continually replacing empty beer glass with full ones regardless of guests ' requests to the contrary .
traditionally , a kölsch could only be called that if the 157-meter -lrb- 515-foot -rrb- high spires of the city 's cathedral could be seen from the brewery .
even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .
mixing with beer popular one of germany 's most popular beers is not a true beer at all - or at least not 100 percent beer .
the " berliner weisse " is a favorite summer drink in the german capital .
there are two versions , one with the addition of raspberry syrup , the other with waldmeister syrup , which comes from the woodruff plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has been known to enjoy a beer in the summer especially , germans get their refreshment by mixing beer with sodas .
radler and alsterwasser are the most popular mixes , made up of half beer and half sprite or orange soda -lrb- fanta -rrb- .
cola mixes are also widespread .
yet if beer to you means just a bitter tasting malt beverage that should never be tainted with sugary sodas , bamberg 's rauchbier , or smoke beer , made with smoked barley malt , may be just what you 're looking for .
if all you really want is a big kick , you might try a donnerbock , or thunder bock , with alcohol content of 13 percent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de which bud 's for europe ?

" we had given them a chance until midday -lrb- 0730 gmt -rrb- , but -lrb- eu foreign policy chief javier -rrb- solana has not announced any decision , " he told iranian state television , according to reuters news service .
" in the next half hour we will hand a letter to the un nuclear agency saying we will restart activities today , " he added .
the move has raised the stakes in the nuclear standoff and risks seeing iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions , a persistent demand of the united states which accuses iran of seeking atomic weapons .
the uranium conversion process , carried out in iran at a facility in the central city of isfahan , changes uranium ore into the uranium gas that is the feedstock for enrichment .
iran agreed in november to suspend uranium enrichment activities , a process that makes fuel for civilian nuclear power plants but can also be the explosive core of atom bombs , during negotiations with the europeans . the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany is preparing a package of trade , technology and security incentives in return for iran guaranteeing its nuclear program is peaceful .
a right to enrichment ? tehran insists it has the right to enrichment under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and the issue has been one of the chief stumbling blocks in the process with the europeans .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un security council washington accuses its iran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge vehemently denied by the islamic republic , and the negotiation process with the eu is aimed at avoiding tehran being brought before the security council .
eu concerned but the eu-3 is " warning about the consequences of breaking the suspension and that this will lead to the matter being taken to the un security council , " one diplomat told afp in vienna , the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-elect mahmoud ahmadinejad , speaks to the media , during his first news conference since being elected on friday , in the city council building in tehran , iran , sunday , june 26 , 2005 .
the ultraconservative ahmadinejad has vowed to pursue a peaceful nuclear program and said iran does n't need america to make progress .

even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .

a member of the alleged july 21 cell , fighting extradition from rome , denied he had links to osama bin laden 's al qaeda terror group and said the attacks were " just a gesture . " at least three men wanted over the attacks were being interrogated by police in london .
britain was also seeking access to the reported ringleader of the july 7 blasts , british national haroon aswat , who was arrested in zambia on july 20 . the sunday times said a third terror cell was planning multiple suicide bomb attacks on london .
the weekly said they were on the loose and planning further blasts on " soft " targets like the underground subway network .
the newspaper said intelligence of a third cell with access to explosives and plans to hit london was known to british police , who have not retracted from friday 's statement , " the threat remains and is very real . " the group was said to be independent of the previous bombers but members were associated with some of the suspects nabbed over the july 21 attacks . a metropolitan police firearms officer told the newspaper arrests so far were " just the tip of the iceberg .
" there is some big stuff coming in the next few months .
there 's a big network that 's got to be cracked . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in italian custody : osman hussain suspect bomber osman hussain -lrb- photo -rrb- has begun making revelations about the july 21 incidents .
the alleged attempted bomber of an underground train at shepherd 's bush station , in custody in rome , denied links with al qaeda , the italian news agency ansa reported , quoting records of the interrogation .
" just a gesture " " i have no connection with al qaeda , " hussain - also known as issac hamdi - told italian magistrates after his arrest .
" i joined a muscle-building class in notting hill -lrb- west london -rrb- and i was told we had to act to avenge our people who had been arrested , thrown into prison after the july 7 bombings , " the ethiopian-born naturalized briton said .
" a signal had to be given and we did it , but we did not intend to kill anybody .
it was just a gesture , " he declared , adding that he had no links with the four july 7 suicide bombers . italian justice ministry sources said supporting documentation required for extradition in the case of suspects held under the new european arrest warrant is expected from british police monday .
the new arrest warrant , ratified by the italian parliament in april , has streamlined extradition procedures between european union states and could mean the hussain could be handed over within days . if the subject of the warrant refuses extradition the country where he or she is held has 60 days , extendable by a further 30 , to make a decision . " terrorist goldmine " a british sunday newspaper revealed a bag feared to have been meant to aid further bombers enter and exit britain was found abandoned by london 's main heathrow airport , stuffed with fake passports , documents and bank cards .
the news of the world called the find a " potential terrorist goldmine . "
the 19 passports inside were for pakistani , british , indian , nepalese and south african nationals .
the bag also contained a letter written to a muslim in dewsbury , northern england - home to july 7 suicide bomber mohammed sidique khan .
mastermind arrested in zambia ? zambian police confirmed saturday that aswat was arrested on july 20 in lusaka .
the british foreign office has said it is seeking access to a man being held by the zambian authorities . " his arrest follows ongoing security investigations on the threat of terrorism to which mr aswat is alleged to be connected , " zambian police inspector general ephraim maateyo said in a statement .
" he entered the country on july 6 .
he is a british national and is currently in custody of zambian security authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police officers cordon off the scene of a police raid in an apartment block in west london , friday a total of 11 suspects were still in british custody over the two waves of london bomb attacks .
twenty-eight people had been arrested altogether by british police in the terror investigations , the metropolitan police revealed saturday . reports said the girlfriends of july 21 bombing suspects ibrahim and mohammed were the two women arrested friday fleeing a bag check at london 's liverpool street railway terminus .
british newspapers said the pair were heading for london stanstead airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.07.2005 in the land of beer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians drink more beer than milk a rose is a rose is a rose - but that does n't hold true for beer .
as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide . while beer is beloved throughout germany , most people associate the malt beverage with big bavarian men wearing lederhosen and green felt hats decorated with bushy brushes served a stein of amber brew by a big woman wearing a dirndl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's a common picture at germany 's largest beer garden , the octoberfest in munich should you make it to bavaria and finally utter those words you spent hours learning from a beginning german cassette , " ein bier bitte , " you will receive a large glass mug of helles , or lager beer .
it is n't as hoppy as your standard pilsner , hence it can go down quickly .
the mug itself is a standard feature of munich 's beer gardens and you will hardly find it anywhere north of the main river .
if you are looking for something more unusual , go to düsseldorf .
the city on the rhine river is about the only place you can order an alt .
it 's dark in color and bitter in flavor , the second attribute of which is particularly useful on a hot summer day .
trademark beer the opposite of the large beer mug in bavaria is cologne 's stange , a tall , thin glass that holds 0.2 liters -lrb- 0.4 pints -rrb- of kölsch .
ordering one of these in düsseldorf , a mere 35 kilometers away -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- could result in a small run-in with the bar staff and customers who wo n't take kindly to the light-colored beer from the rival city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : your typical " stange " from cologne one of the nicer traditions of drinking in a cologne pub is the so-called köbes , your waiter .
the kobeses are notorious for continually replacing empty beer glass with full ones regardless of guests ' requests to the contrary .
traditionally , a kölsch could only be called that if the 157-meter -lrb- 515-foot -rrb- high spires of the city 's cathedral could be seen from the brewery .
even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .
mixing with beer popular one of germany 's most popular beers is not a true beer at all - or at least not 100 percent beer .
the " berliner weisse " is a favorite summer drink in the german capital .
there are two versions , one with the addition of raspberry syrup , the other with waldmeister syrup , which comes from the woodruff plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has been known to enjoy a beer in the summer especially , germans get their refreshment by mixing beer with sodas .
radler and alsterwasser are the most popular mixes , made up of half beer and half sprite or orange soda -lrb- fanta -rrb- .
cola mixes are also widespread .
yet if beer to you means just a bitter tasting malt beverage that should never be tainted with sugary sodas , bamberg 's rauchbier , or smoke beer , made with smoked barley malt , may be just what you 're looking for .
if all you really want is a big kick , you might try a donnerbock , or thunder bock , with alcohol content of 13 percent . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de which bud 's for europe ?

but the catholic church event is already being overshadowed by the threat of terrorist attacks on civilians . dealing with the security of such events is a massive undertaking for the police , who are charged not only with the taking care of the hundreds of thousands of youngsters , but with pope benedict xvi and other high-profile religious figures and politicians . the security operation is on a grand scale and will draw on resources from local and federal police and private security staff as well portuguese , french and and italian police and some 30 sniffer dogs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city will be crawling with police during the world youth day even with several thousand people working together to prevent terrorist attacks , there is no way of monitoring the moves of every one of the more than 800,000 people expected to attend the six-day event . hermann-josef johanns , managing director of the catholic festival , said organizers are doing everything they can to ensure the safety during the gathering . " as the event organizers , we have to work together with the relevant authorities to make sure that people can celebrate in a safe environment .
we are never going to be able to ensure one hundred percent security at such a huge event , and to believe that is possible is quite simple illusionary , " he said . too many police ? such a mass of police and security staff could seem alienating for the young pilgrims who are coming from all corners of the world to celebrate their beliefs , sing and pray together . in order to hear the pope speak , they will have to pass through tight security controls in a process which could take hours and , some fear , ruin the joy of the celebration .

but the catholic church event is already being overshadowed by the threat of terrorist attacks on civilians . dealing with the security of such events is a massive undertaking for the police , who are charged not only with the taking care of the hundreds of thousands of youngsters , but with pope benedict xvi and other high-profile religious figures and politicians . the security operation is on a grand scale and will draw on resources from local and federal police and private security staff as well portuguese , french and and italian police and some 30 sniffer dogs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city will be crawling with police during the world youth day even with several thousand people working together to prevent terrorist attacks , there is no way of monitoring the moves of every one of the more than 800,000 people expected to attend the six-day event . hermann-josef johanns , managing director of the catholic festival , said organizers are doing everything they can to ensure the safety during the gathering . " as the event organizers , we have to work together with the relevant authorities to make sure that people can celebrate in a safe environment .
we are never going to be able to ensure one hundred percent security at such a huge event , and to believe that is possible is quite simple illusionary , " he said . too many police ? such a mass of police and security staff could seem alienating for the young pilgrims who are coming from all corners of the world to celebrate their beliefs , sing and pray together . in order to hear the pope speak , they will have to pass through tight security controls in a process which could take hours and , some fear , ruin the joy of the celebration .
johanns said the whole issue of security would have to be dealt with in a sensitive fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi " take the example of the pope surrounded by a lot of young people when he 's on the boat on the rhine river .
there will be security people there who will not be recognizable as such .
they 'll be young and professional , but people wo n't notice them , which will enable us to grant the pope and the people on the ship some protection , " he said .
" what we do n't want is a police party , but a police presence which is not too obvious .
and the authorities are aware of that . " well practiced cologne has already had two papal visits and is thus familiar with the security levels synonymous with them .
but this time , the measures will be even more elaborate , with tight restrictions on roads , bridges , waterways and the airspace above the city , dieter klinger , head of the police operation , said . it is a lot of effort to go to given police no reason to believe the event is indeed a target for a terrorist attack .
but since the possibility ca n't be ruled out , neither the german authorities not the world youth day organizers are prepared to take any risks .

but the catholic church event is already being overshadowed by the threat of terrorist attacks on civilians . dealing with the security of such events is a massive undertaking for the police , who are charged not only with the taking care of the hundreds of thousands of youngsters , but with pope benedict xvi and other high-profile religious figures and politicians . the security operation is on a grand scale and will draw on resources from local and federal police and private security staff as well portuguese , french and and italian police and some 30 sniffer dogs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city will be crawling with police during the world youth day even with several thousand people working together to prevent terrorist attacks , there is no way of monitoring the moves of every one of the more than 800,000 people expected to attend the six-day event . hermann-josef johanns , managing director of the catholic festival , said organizers are doing everything they can to ensure the safety during the gathering . " as the event organizers , we have to work together with the relevant authorities to make sure that people can celebrate in a safe environment .
we are never going to be able to ensure one hundred percent security at such a huge event , and to believe that is possible is quite simple illusionary , " he said . too many police ? such a mass of police and security staff could seem alienating for the young pilgrims who are coming from all corners of the world to celebrate their beliefs , sing and pray together . in order to hear the pope speak , they will have to pass through tight security controls in a process which could take hours and , some fear , ruin the joy of the celebration .
johanns said the whole issue of security would have to be dealt with in a sensitive fashion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi " take the example of the pope surrounded by a lot of young people when he 's on the boat on the rhine river .
there will be security people there who will not be recognizable as such .
they 'll be young and professional , but people wo n't notice them , which will enable us to grant the pope and the people on the ship some protection , " he said .
" what we do n't want is a police party , but a police presence which is not too obvious .
and the authorities are aware of that . " well practiced cologne has already had two papal visits and is thus familiar with the security levels synonymous with them .
but this time , the measures will be even more elaborate , with tight restrictions on roads , bridges , waterways and the airspace above the city , dieter klinger , head of the police operation , said . it is a lot of effort to go to given police no reason to believe the event is indeed a target for a terrorist attack .
but since the possibility ca n't be ruled out , neither the german authorities not the world youth day organizers are prepared to take any risks .

as a beer-drinker 's paradise , the vast choice in germany can be mind-boggling .
here 's a brief guide . while beer is beloved throughout germany , most people associate the malt beverage with big bavarian men wearing lederhosen and green felt hats decorated with bushy brushes served a stein of amber brew by a big woman wearing a dirndl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's a common picture at germany 's largest beer garden , the octoberfest in munich should you make it to bavaria and finally utter those words you spent hours learning from a beginning german cassette , " ein bier bitte , " you will receive a large glass mug of helles , or lager beer .
it is n't as hoppy as your standard pilsner , hence it can go down quickly .
the mug itself is a standard feature of munich 's beer gardens and you will hardly find it anywhere north of the main river .
if you are looking for something more unusual , go to düsseldorf .
the city on the rhine river is about the only place you can order an alt .
it 's dark in color and bitter in flavor , the second attribute of which is particularly useful on a hot summer day .
trademark beer the opposite of the large beer mug in bavaria is cologne 's stange , a tall , thin glass that holds 0.2 liters -lrb- 0.4 pints -rrb- of kölsch .
ordering one of these in düsseldorf , a mere 35 kilometers away -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- could result in a small run-in with the bar staff and customers who wo n't take kindly to the light-colored beer from the rival city .

even today , the term is a registered trademark in the eu , like champagne and cognac .
mixing with beer popular one of germany 's most popular beers is not a true beer at all - or at least not 100 percent beer .
the " berliner weisse " is a favorite summer drink in the german capital .
there are two versions , one with the addition of raspberry syrup , the other with waldmeister syrup , which comes from the woodruff plant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder has been known to enjoy a beer in the summer especially , germans get their refreshment by mixing beer with sodas .
radler and alsterwasser are the most popular mixes , made up of half beer and half sprite or orange soda -lrb- fanta -rrb- .
cola mixes are also widespread .
yet if beer to you means just a bitter tasting malt beverage that should never be tainted with sugary sodas , bamberg 's rauchbier , or smoke beer , made with smoked barley malt , may be just what you 're looking for .

he wrote to the sunday times : " i would have thought that the wizards , witches , trolls , unicorns , hidden worlds ... would have given her a clue ? "
harry potter and the halfblood prince has been a runaway bestseller in the uk and us since its release on 16 july .
pratchett is one of the uk 's most successful novelists .
his comments came on rowling 's 40th birthday , also harry potter 's birthday .
in a recent interview with time magazine , rowling said she was " not a huge fan of fantasy " and was trying to " subvert " the genre .
the magazine also said rowling reinvented fantasy fiction , which was previously stuck in " an idealised , romanticised , pseudofeudal world , where knights and ladies morris-dance to greensleeves " .
pratchett , whose first fantasy novel was published 34 years ago and has since sold more than 40 million books , said in his letter that the genre had always been " edgy and inventive " .
" ever since the lord of the rings revitalised the genre , writers have played with it , reinvented it , subverted it and bent it to their times , " he wrote .
" it has also contained some of the very best , most accessible writing for children , by writers who seldom get the acknowledgement they deserve . "
his full response to rowling 's admission that she did not think harry potter was fantasy as she was writing it , was : " i would have thought that the wizards , witches , trolls , unicorns , hidden worlds , jumping chocolate frogs , owl mail , magic food , ghosts , broomsticks and spells would have given her a clue ? "
meanwhile , rowling celebrated her 40th birthday on sunday , the day she has also made her young creation 's birthday .
the author 's website displayed pictures of a birthday cake and birthday card with the words : " happy birthday harry potter . "
fans have been trying to deduce how old he is , with one site saying the boy wizard has now turned 25 .
