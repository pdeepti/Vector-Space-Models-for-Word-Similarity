they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .
in 1998 world cup qualifiers , the spaniards took both matches from slovakia . czechs face norway ; turkey and swiss to meet the other two matchups will pit teams that last clashed in the 1996 european cup qualification rounds .

in the euro 96 qualifiers , both sides won on the opponent 's grounds 2-1 . uruguay , australia in rematch soccer fans in colombia and chile must be frustrated with one of the world 's greatest soccer nations .
for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia . " uruguay must be at the world cup and our dream of getting there is still alive , " lone goalscorer recoba said after the 1-0 victory over argentina at montevideo 's centenario stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia can earn a ticket to germany by beating uruguay and taking a stab at the argentineans , uruguayan defender diego lugano said the playoff against australia will be " more difficult than argentina . " uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out .

" uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe .

" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .
" i would describe the situation as pure panic , " pharmacist hasan erdem said in downtown ankara . cull speeds up as romania chases containment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are plans to slaughter some 40,000 birds in coming days in romania , veterinary teams accompanied by police sped up the slaughter of poultry in a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- zone around the backyard farm in the danube delta where a bird virus had been found . on friday bucharest said the virus was detected in a second village nearby , in samples taken from a goose and a chicken .
" the village was immediately placed in quarantine and all the poultry will be sacrificed , " a spokesman said . the eu commission slapped on a ban on live bird imports on turkey on monday even before confirming the presence of hn51 .
it took a similar step thursday against romania after the presence of an undetermined strain of bird flu was confirmed . germany locks up its flocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations are working to keep the virus from spreading the german government called friday on regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against any possible bird flu epidemic . in zones at risk " enclosure measures " of " open air " poultry need to be taken , alexander müller , secretary of state at the ministry of consumer protection , said . geese and ducks should be segregated from chickens , as far as possible , he said after a meeting of representatives of the 16 regional states which have responsibility in this area .
three states - lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia - have already ordered poultry to be kept inside until november 30 . special measures are also planned to avoid the possibility of bird flu infecting pigs , müller said . helmut born , secretary-general of the federation of german farmers , called friday for a nationwide ban on the raising of poultry in the open air . eu foreign ministers are due to discuss the bird flu threat at an emergency meeting in luxembourg next week , primarily focused on world trade talks but with the avian influenza crisis forcing itself onto the menu . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds despite assurances from the government , scientific institutes and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , germans are starting to panic that bird flu may be coming their way .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .
in 1998 world cup qualifiers , the spaniards took both matches from slovakia . czechs face norway ; turkey and swiss to meet the other two matchups will pit teams that last clashed in the 1996 european cup qualification rounds .

in the euro 96 qualifiers , both sides won on the opponent 's grounds 2-1 . uruguay , australia in rematch soccer fans in colombia and chile must be frustrated with one of the world 's greatest soccer nations .
for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia . " uruguay must be at the world cup and our dream of getting there is still alive , " lone goalscorer recoba said after the 1-0 victory over argentina at montevideo 's centenario stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia can earn a ticket to germany by beating uruguay and taking a stab at the argentineans , uruguayan defender diego lugano said the playoff against australia will be " more difficult than argentina . " uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.10.2005 deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite every effort , the h5n1 strain has breached europe 's borders hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .
this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe . " we have received telephone confirmation from london that it is the h5n1 virus , " alina monea , spokeswoman at romania 's veterinary and animal health authority , told reuters . eu stockpiles drugs as virus crosses border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion : bird flu looks towards the eu the commission , the eu 's executive branch , on thursday called on eu governments to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and said people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular influenza . the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . in geneva , the world health organization said friday that it was concerned about the new outbreaks - but sought to allay panic .
" the spread of h5n1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur , " it said , while stressing that the h5n1 virus " does not spread easily from birds to humans . " in a further worrying sign , a new study said researchers have identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared influenza pandemic . turkey claims to have outbreak under control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds are buried and the ground above them disenfected at the center of the crisis in turkey , the environment ministry on friday banned the hunting of wild birds - but officials remained confident the disease had been successfully contained .
" it looks like it is dying out , " ministry spokesman faruk demirel told afp . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan tried to calm fears , breaking his dawn-to-dusk ramadan fast on thursday with a forkful of chicken salad after the confirmation that the h5n1 virus had been detected in his country .
" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .
" i would describe the situation as pure panic , " pharmacist hasan erdem said in downtown ankara . cull speeds up as romania chases containment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are plans to slaughter some 40,000 birds in coming days in romania , veterinary teams accompanied by police sped up the slaughter of poultry in a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- zone around the backyard farm in the danube delta where a bird virus had been found . on friday bucharest said the virus was detected in a second village nearby , in samples taken from a goose and a chicken .
" the village was immediately placed in quarantine and all the poultry will be sacrificed , " a spokesman said . the eu commission slapped on a ban on live bird imports on turkey on monday even before confirming the presence of hn51 .
it took a similar step thursday against romania after the presence of an undetermined strain of bird flu was confirmed . germany locks up its flocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations are working to keep the virus from spreading the german government called friday on regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against any possible bird flu epidemic . in zones at risk " enclosure measures " of " open air " poultry need to be taken , alexander müller , secretary of state at the ministry of consumer protection , said . geese and ducks should be segregated from chickens , as far as possible , he said after a meeting of representatives of the 16 regional states which have responsibility in this area .
three states - lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia - have already ordered poultry to be kept inside until november 30 . special measures are also planned to avoid the possibility of bird flu infecting pigs , müller said . helmut born , secretary-general of the federation of german farmers , called friday for a nationwide ban on the raising of poultry in the open air . eu foreign ministers are due to discuss the bird flu threat at an emergency meeting in luxembourg next week , primarily focused on world trade talks but with the avian influenza crisis forcing itself onto the menu . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds despite assurances from the government , scientific institutes and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , germans are starting to panic that bird flu may be coming their way .

this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe . " we have received telephone confirmation from london that it is the h5n1 virus , " alina monea , spokeswoman at romania 's veterinary and animal health authority , told reuters . eu stockpiles drugs as virus crosses border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion : bird flu looks towards the eu the commission , the eu 's executive branch , on thursday called on eu governments to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and said people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular influenza . the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . in geneva , the world health organization said friday that it was concerned about the new outbreaks - but sought to allay panic .
" the spread of h5n1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur , " it said , while stressing that the h5n1 virus " does not spread easily from birds to humans .

" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .

" the village was immediately placed in quarantine and all the poultry will be sacrificed , " a spokesman said . the eu commission slapped on a ban on live bird imports on turkey on monday even before confirming the presence of hn51 .
it took a similar step thursday against romania after the presence of an undetermined strain of bird flu was confirmed . germany locks up its flocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations are working to keep the virus from spreading the german government called friday on regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against any possible bird flu epidemic . in zones at risk " enclosure measures " of " open air " poultry need to be taken , alexander müller , secretary of state at the ministry of consumer protection , said . geese and ducks should be segregated from chickens , as far as possible , he said after a meeting of representatives of the 16 regional states which have responsibility in this area .
three states - lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia - have already ordered poultry to be kept inside until november 30 . special measures are also planned to avoid the possibility of bird flu infecting pigs , müller said . helmut born , secretary-general of the federation of german farmers , called friday for a nationwide ban on the raising of poultry in the open air . eu foreign ministers are due to discuss the bird flu threat at an emergency meeting in luxembourg next week , primarily focused on world trade talks but with the avian influenza crisis forcing itself onto the menu . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds despite assurances from the government , scientific institutes and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , germans are starting to panic that bird flu may be coming their way .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .

in the euro 96 qualifiers , both sides won on the opponent 's grounds 2-1 . uruguay , australia in rematch soccer fans in colombia and chile must be frustrated with one of the world 's greatest soccer nations .
for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia . " uruguay must be at the world cup and our dream of getting there is still alive , " lone goalscorer recoba said after the 1-0 victory over argentina at montevideo 's centenario stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia can earn a ticket to germany by beating uruguay and taking a stab at the argentineans , uruguayan defender diego lugano said the playoff against australia will be " more difficult than argentina . " uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .
in 1998 world cup qualifiers , the spaniards took both matches from slovakia . czechs face norway ; turkey and swiss to meet the other two matchups will pit teams that last clashed in the 1996 european cup qualification rounds .
the czech republic host norway on november 12 before going to the icy cold of oslo four days later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan koller of the czech republic need to improve on their euro 2004 performance norway coach age hareide was happy to avoid spain and thinks the chances against the czechs , the 1996 euro runners-up , are good . " the czech republic is an opponent that i think will suit us , " he said . turkey will face switzerland .
in the euro 96 qualifiers , both sides won on the opponent 's grounds 2-1 . uruguay , australia in rematch soccer fans in colombia and chile must be frustrated with one of the world 's greatest soccer nations .
for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia .

this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe . " we have received telephone confirmation from london that it is the h5n1 virus , " alina monea , spokeswoman at romania 's veterinary and animal health authority , told reuters . eu stockpiles drugs as virus crosses border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion : bird flu looks towards the eu the commission , the eu 's executive branch , on thursday called on eu governments to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and said people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular influenza . the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . in geneva , the world health organization said friday that it was concerned about the new outbreaks - but sought to allay panic .
" the spread of h5n1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur , " it said , while stressing that the h5n1 virus " does not spread easily from birds to humans . " in a further worrying sign , a new study said researchers have identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared influenza pandemic . turkey claims to have outbreak under control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds are buried and the ground above them disenfected at the center of the crisis in turkey , the environment ministry on friday banned the hunting of wild birds - but officials remained confident the disease had been successfully contained .
" it looks like it is dying out , " ministry spokesman faruk demirel told afp . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan tried to calm fears , breaking his dawn-to-dusk ramadan fast on thursday with a forkful of chicken salad after the confirmation that the h5n1 virus had been detected in his country .
" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .

the bosnian serb parliament recently adopted reforms to unify the country 's ethnically divided police force and the country 's international envoy has said the eu could soon open talks with bosnia on a stabilization and association agreement . the new development comes just before the 10th anniversary of the dayton peace accord that ended bosnia 's three-year war in december 1995 . britain rolls out firepower before they set their minds to business , the ministers were treated to a 40-minute display of heavy british firepower , as the host country showed how it would secure a hostile airport . in the first-ever exercise of its kind before eu defense ministers , the military used fighter planes , transport and refueling aircraft , helicopters , artillery and ground troops in a five-phase exercise . harrier jump jets flew in low over the ministers ' heads to destroy " enemy " vehicles dotted around the royal air force base in lyneham southern england , guided to their targets by an advance team of reconnaissance paratroopers . field artillery was dropped in by chinook helicopters and fired off rounds as c-130 aircraft deployed supplies and a huge c-17 transport jet landed on a sixpence to bring in jeeps , a truck and personnel . more competition needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nato-led soldier in the bosnian serb village of celebici the ministers also examined a plan to inject real competition into europe 's arms industry through a voluntary , non-binding code of conduct drawn up by the european defence agency -lrb- eda -rrb- . under it , defense contracts worth more than one million euros would be advertised on a single electronic portal so companies could tender for them . at the moment , member states quietly lump their defense deals under a piece of eu legislation - article 296 - which is meant to exempt them from normal market rules only in cases where their security interests are under threat . but the european commission , the eu 's competition watchdog , plans to crack down on abuses of the article and has forced the industry 's hand . eu defense needs more funds the talks come amid renewed calls to boost eu defense spending , notably in research and development and in key areas such as mid-air refueling planes , as the eu 's theater of operations spreads from the balkans to africa . they also come after us general joseph ralston and general klaus naumann of germany warned that europe could be overwhelmed by security challenges like international terrorism unless it starts pooling its defenses . " staying the course is not an option - indeed , it is a recipe for disaster .
seen in this light , defense integration is not just an appealing or interesting idea : it is an imperative , " they said in a report . british defense secretary john reid , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency and is hosting the informal talks , told the financial times that nato and the eu must work more closely together . " part of the big challenge facing us is to make both nato and the european union more effective and to make sure , so far as possible , they are complementary , they operate in partnership , and not competitors in a zero-sum game , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to supervise aceh peace accord the european union is set to head an unprecedented mission to supervise the implementation of a peace agreement that was signed monday in helsinki ending decades of bloodshed in indonesia 's aceh province .

the bosnian serb parliament recently adopted reforms to unify the country 's ethnically divided police force and the country 's international envoy has said the eu could soon open talks with bosnia on a stabilization and association agreement . the new development comes just before the 10th anniversary of the dayton peace accord that ended bosnia 's three-year war in december 1995 . britain rolls out firepower before they set their minds to business , the ministers were treated to a 40-minute display of heavy british firepower , as the host country showed how it would secure a hostile airport . in the first-ever exercise of its kind before eu defense ministers , the military used fighter planes , transport and refueling aircraft , helicopters , artillery and ground troops in a five-phase exercise . harrier jump jets flew in low over the ministers ' heads to destroy " enemy " vehicles dotted around the royal air force base in lyneham southern england , guided to their targets by an advance team of reconnaissance paratroopers . field artillery was dropped in by chinook helicopters and fired off rounds as c-130 aircraft deployed supplies and a huge c-17 transport jet landed on a sixpence to bring in jeeps , a truck and personnel . more competition needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nato-led soldier in the bosnian serb village of celebici the ministers also examined a plan to inject real competition into europe 's arms industry through a voluntary , non-binding code of conduct drawn up by the european defence agency -lrb- eda -rrb- . under it , defense contracts worth more than one million euros would be advertised on a single electronic portal so companies could tender for them . at the moment , member states quietly lump their defense deals under a piece of eu legislation - article 296 - which is meant to exempt them from normal market rules only in cases where their security interests are under threat . but the european commission , the eu 's competition watchdog , plans to crack down on abuses of the article and has forced the industry 's hand . eu defense needs more funds the talks come amid renewed calls to boost eu defense spending , notably in research and development and in key areas such as mid-air refueling planes , as the eu 's theater of operations spreads from the balkans to africa . they also come after us general joseph ralston and general klaus naumann of germany warned that europe could be overwhelmed by security challenges like international terrorism unless it starts pooling its defenses .

" part of the big challenge facing us is to make both nato and the european union more effective and to make sure , so far as possible , they are complementary , they operate in partnership , and not competitors in a zero-sum game , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to supervise aceh peace accord the european union is set to head an unprecedented mission to supervise the implementation of a peace agreement that was signed monday in helsinki ending decades of bloodshed in indonesia 's aceh province .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .

for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia . " uruguay must be at the world cup and our dream of getting there is still alive , " lone goalscorer recoba said after the 1-0 victory over argentina at montevideo 's centenario stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia can earn a ticket to germany by beating uruguay and taking a stab at the argentineans , uruguayan defender diego lugano said the playoff against australia will be " more difficult than argentina . " uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .
in 1998 world cup qualifiers , the spaniards took both matches from slovakia . czechs face norway ; turkey and swiss to meet the other two matchups will pit teams that last clashed in the 1996 european cup qualification rounds .

for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia . " uruguay must be at the world cup and our dream of getting there is still alive , " lone goalscorer recoba said after the 1-0 victory over argentina at montevideo 's centenario stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia can earn a ticket to germany by beating uruguay and taking a stab at the argentineans , uruguayan defender diego lugano said the playoff against australia will be " more difficult than argentina . " uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.10.2005 deadly bird flu strain confirmed in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite every effort , the h5n1 strain has breached europe 's borders hopes that the deadly h5n1 strain of avian flu had not yet reached mainland europe were dashed saturday after samples from romanian ducks proved positive .
this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe . " we have received telephone confirmation from london that it is the h5n1 virus , " alina monea , spokeswoman at romania 's veterinary and animal health authority , told reuters . eu stockpiles drugs as virus crosses border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion : bird flu looks towards the eu the commission , the eu 's executive branch , on thursday called on eu governments to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and said people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular influenza . the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . in geneva , the world health organization said friday that it was concerned about the new outbreaks - but sought to allay panic .
" the spread of h5n1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur , " it said , while stressing that the h5n1 virus " does not spread easily from birds to humans . " in a further worrying sign , a new study said researchers have identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared influenza pandemic . turkey claims to have outbreak under control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds are buried and the ground above them disenfected at the center of the crisis in turkey , the environment ministry on friday banned the hunting of wild birds - but officials remained confident the disease had been successfully contained .
" it looks like it is dying out , " ministry spokesman faruk demirel told afp . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan tried to calm fears , breaking his dawn-to-dusk ramadan fast on thursday with a forkful of chicken salad after the confirmation that the h5n1 virus had been detected in his country .
" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .
" i would describe the situation as pure panic , " pharmacist hasan erdem said in downtown ankara . cull speeds up as romania chases containment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are plans to slaughter some 40,000 birds in coming days in romania , veterinary teams accompanied by police sped up the slaughter of poultry in a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- zone around the backyard farm in the danube delta where a bird virus had been found . on friday bucharest said the virus was detected in a second village nearby , in samples taken from a goose and a chicken .

" slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 .

" uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .

three states - lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia - have already ordered poultry to be kept inside until november 30 . special measures are also planned to avoid the possibility of bird flu infecting pigs , müller said . helmut born , secretary-general of the federation of german farmers , called friday for a nationwide ban on the raising of poultry in the open air . eu foreign ministers are due to discuss the bird flu threat at an emergency meeting in luxembourg next week , primarily focused on world trade talks but with the avian influenza crisis forcing itself onto the menu . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds despite assurances from the government , scientific institutes and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , germans are starting to panic that bird flu may be coming their way .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 .

the bosnian serb parliament recently adopted reforms to unify the country 's ethnically divided police force and the country 's international envoy has said the eu could soon open talks with bosnia on a stabilization and association agreement . the new development comes just before the 10th anniversary of the dayton peace accord that ended bosnia 's three-year war in december 1995 . britain rolls out firepower before they set their minds to business , the ministers were treated to a 40-minute display of heavy british firepower , as the host country showed how it would secure a hostile airport . in the first-ever exercise of its kind before eu defense ministers , the military used fighter planes , transport and refueling aircraft , helicopters , artillery and ground troops in a five-phase exercise . harrier jump jets flew in low over the ministers ' heads to destroy " enemy " vehicles dotted around the royal air force base in lyneham southern england , guided to their targets by an advance team of reconnaissance paratroopers . field artillery was dropped in by chinook helicopters and fired off rounds as c-130 aircraft deployed supplies and a huge c-17 transport jet landed on a sixpence to bring in jeeps , a truck and personnel . more competition needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german nato-led soldier in the bosnian serb village of celebici the ministers also examined a plan to inject real competition into europe 's arms industry through a voluntary , non-binding code of conduct drawn up by the european defence agency -lrb- eda -rrb- . under it , defense contracts worth more than one million euros would be advertised on a single electronic portal so companies could tender for them . at the moment , member states quietly lump their defense deals under a piece of eu legislation - article 296 - which is meant to exempt them from normal market rules only in cases where their security interests are under threat . but the european commission , the eu 's competition watchdog , plans to crack down on abuses of the article and has forced the industry 's hand . eu defense needs more funds the talks come amid renewed calls to boost eu defense spending , notably in research and development and in key areas such as mid-air refueling planes , as the eu 's theater of operations spreads from the balkans to africa . they also come after us general joseph ralston and general klaus naumann of germany warned that europe could be overwhelmed by security challenges like international terrorism unless it starts pooling its defenses . " staying the course is not an option - indeed , it is a recipe for disaster .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 .

they have however not failed to qualify for a world cup since 1974 , so the pressure to assure their place in germany next summer is great . " slovakia are definitely not the team i was hoping for , " aragones told reuters after spain drew slovakia on friday . aragones spoke of a team that might not be technically as skilled as his own but his players must face a physically tough squad , paying respect to the slovaks .
a loss to slovakia can not be ruled out . " of course we have always had good players technically but in recent years we have not been able to convert that talent into international success , " aragones admitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovakia 's robert vittek has a chance to keep spain out of the tournament the slovakian soccer association , while not overjoyed to be facing probably the strongest of the possible opponents , was happy to avoid a draw against the czech republic , their neighbor and former national partner as czechoslovakia until 1993 . " we were quite keen to avoid a big derby against the czech republic , " said association general secretary dusan tittel to reuters .
the derby will not happen , but it 's hard to say whether spain is a preferable opponent .
in 1998 world cup qualifiers , the spaniards took both matches from slovakia . czechs face norway ; turkey and swiss to meet the other two matchups will pit teams that last clashed in the 1996 european cup qualification rounds .

" the czech republic is an opponent that i think will suit us , " he said . turkey will face switzerland .
in the euro 96 qualifiers , both sides won on the opponent 's grounds 2-1 . uruguay , australia in rematch soccer fans in colombia and chile must be frustrated with one of the world 's greatest soccer nations .
for the second time in two world cup qualifying rounds , the two-time world champions from argentina failed to beat uruguay , and hence allowed their river plate neighbors to advance to the playoff round to face australia . " uruguay must be at the world cup and our dream of getting there is still alive , " lone goalscorer recoba said after the 1-0 victory over argentina at montevideo 's centenario stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australia can earn a ticket to germany by beating uruguay and taking a stab at the argentineans , uruguayan defender diego lugano said the playoff against australia will be " more difficult than argentina . " uruguay finished one point ahead of colombia to finish fifth in the ten-team south america group .
four years ago , they also ended fifth after a 1-1 draw against argentina in the last group stage match that many critics called highly uncompetitive .
uruguay went on to beat the socceroos from australia 3-1 on aggregate to play at the 2002 world cup . in the fifth and final matchup to determine who will compete for the world cup in 2006 , the fourth-place concacaf squad , surprising trinidad and tobago , will play fifth-place asian side bahrain . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hold off socceroos jürgen klinsmann 's germany opened the confederations cup with a 4-3 victory over australia .

this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe . " we have received telephone confirmation from london that it is the h5n1 virus , " alina monea , spokeswoman at romania 's veterinary and animal health authority , told reuters . eu stockpiles drugs as virus crosses border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion : bird flu looks towards the eu the commission , the eu 's executive branch , on thursday called on eu governments to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and said people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular influenza . the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . in geneva , the world health organization said friday that it was concerned about the new outbreaks - but sought to allay panic .
" the spread of h5n1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur , " it said , while stressing that the h5n1 virus " does not spread easily from birds to humans . " in a further worrying sign , a new study said researchers have identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared influenza pandemic . turkey claims to have outbreak under control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds are buried and the ground above them disenfected at the center of the crisis in turkey , the environment ministry on friday banned the hunting of wild birds - but officials remained confident the disease had been successfully contained .
" it looks like it is dying out , " ministry spokesman faruk demirel told afp . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan tried to calm fears , breaking his dawn-to-dusk ramadan fast on thursday with a forkful of chicken salad after the confirmation that the h5n1 virus had been detected in his country .
" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .
" i would describe the situation as pure panic , " pharmacist hasan erdem said in downtown ankara . cull speeds up as romania chases containment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are plans to slaughter some 40,000 birds in coming days in romania , veterinary teams accompanied by police sped up the slaughter of poultry in a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- zone around the backyard farm in the danube delta where a bird virus had been found . on friday bucharest said the virus was detected in a second village nearby , in samples taken from a goose and a chicken .
" the village was immediately placed in quarantine and all the poultry will be sacrificed , " a spokesman said . the eu commission slapped on a ban on live bird imports on turkey on monday even before confirming the presence of hn51 .
it took a similar step thursday against romania after the presence of an undetermined strain of bird flu was confirmed . germany locks up its flocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations are working to keep the virus from spreading the german government called friday on regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against any possible bird flu epidemic . in zones at risk " enclosure measures " of " open air " poultry need to be taken , alexander müller , secretary of state at the ministry of consumer protection , said . geese and ducks should be segregated from chickens , as far as possible , he said after a meeting of representatives of the 16 regional states which have responsibility in this area .
three states - lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia - have already ordered poultry to be kept inside until november 30 . special measures are also planned to avoid the possibility of bird flu infecting pigs , müller said . helmut born , secretary-general of the federation of german farmers , called friday for a nationwide ban on the raising of poultry in the open air . eu foreign ministers are due to discuss the bird flu threat at an emergency meeting in luxembourg next week , primarily focused on world trade talks but with the avian influenza crisis forcing itself onto the menu . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds despite assurances from the government , scientific institutes and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , germans are starting to panic that bird flu may be coming their way .

this follows a similar confirmation in turkey on friday europe bolstered its defenses against bird flu friday after the lethal asian strain of the virus was confirmed in turkey , and then later romania , raising further fears of a potential pandemic throughout the european mainland . but eu veterinary experts , while approving a package of measures including advising that some poultry should be moved indoors , also underlined that the avian influenza poses no risk to public health " at present . " " information from the outbreaks of avian influenza this week in east europe -lrb- romania and turkey -rrb- suggests that the disease remains confined to poultry and wild birds and at this stage no human cases have been confirmed , " they said .
" therefore at present avian influenza does not represent a risk to the general public . " authorities scrambled to allay panic after the h5n1 virus was identified on the continent 's southeastern border , but early on saturday the romanian state veterinary authority confirmed that lab tests in britain had discovered that an outbreak of bird flu in romania to contain h5n1 , the strain that is potentially highly pathogenic to humans . the tests on three ducks found dead in romania 's danube delta near the black sea last week confirmed fears that the disease , which has killed more than 60 people in asia since 2003 , has entered europe . " we have received telephone confirmation from london that it is the h5n1 virus , " alina monea , spokeswoman at romania 's veterinary and animal health authority , told reuters . eu stockpiles drugs as virus crosses border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european expansion : bird flu looks towards the eu the commission , the eu 's executive branch , on thursday called on eu governments to stockpile anti-viral drugs , and said people at risk should ensure they are vaccinated against regular influenza . the big fear among experts is that h5n1 may mutate , acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that would make it highly infectious as well as lethal - possibly killing millions worldwide as the influenza pandemic of 1918 did . in geneva , the world health organization said friday that it was concerned about the new outbreaks - but sought to allay panic .
" the spread of h5n1 to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur , " it said , while stressing that the h5n1 virus " does not spread easily from birds to humans . " in a further worrying sign , a new study said researchers have identified a mutated form of h5n1 bird flu that is resistant to tamiflu , the drug being stockpiled around the world to counter a feared influenza pandemic . turkey claims to have outbreak under control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birds are buried and the ground above them disenfected at the center of the crisis in turkey , the environment ministry on friday banned the hunting of wild birds - but officials remained confident the disease had been successfully contained .
" it looks like it is dying out , " ministry spokesman faruk demirel told afp . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan tried to calm fears , breaking his dawn-to-dusk ramadan fast on thursday with a forkful of chicken salad after the confirmation that the h5n1 virus had been detected in his country .
" do you know what this is ? " he asked reporters .
" i hope you will change your headlines from now on , " he joked . but turkish producers said poultry sales slid by up to 50 percent , and pharmacists reported surging demand for anti-viral drug tamiflu .
" i would describe the situation as pure panic , " pharmacist hasan erdem said in downtown ankara . cull speeds up as romania chases containment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are plans to slaughter some 40,000 birds in coming days in romania , veterinary teams accompanied by police sped up the slaughter of poultry in a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- zone around the backyard farm in the danube delta where a bird virus had been found . on friday bucharest said the virus was detected in a second village nearby , in samples taken from a goose and a chicken .
" the village was immediately placed in quarantine and all the poultry will be sacrificed , " a spokesman said . the eu commission slapped on a ban on live bird imports on turkey on monday even before confirming the presence of hn51 .
it took a similar step thursday against romania after the presence of an undetermined strain of bird flu was confirmed . germany locks up its flocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations are working to keep the virus from spreading the german government called friday on regional states to take rapid steps to enclose flocks of poultry in regions where there is intensive farming of birds to protect them against any possible bird flu epidemic . in zones at risk " enclosure measures " of " open air " poultry need to be taken , alexander müller , secretary of state at the ministry of consumer protection , said . geese and ducks should be segregated from chickens , as far as possible , he said after a meeting of representatives of the 16 regional states which have responsibility in this area .
three states - lower saxony , mecklenburg-western pomerania and north rhine-westphalia - have already ordered poultry to be kept inside until november 30 . special measures are also planned to avoid the possibility of bird flu infecting pigs , müller said . helmut born , secretary-general of the federation of german farmers , called friday for a nationwide ban on the raising of poultry in the open air . eu foreign ministers are due to discuss the bird flu threat at an emergency meeting in luxembourg next week , primarily focused on world trade talks but with the avian influenza crisis forcing itself onto the menu . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds despite assurances from the government , scientific institutes and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , germans are starting to panic that bird flu may be coming their way .

the medics have very few clues about the family of this wounded boy who was airlifted to a hospital in srinagar , summer capital of indian-administered kashmir , from his quake devastated village in uri .
what they do know from some of the boy 's neighbours who are attending to their injured relatives in the same hospital is that zafar 's father died in last saturday 's earthquake which razed dalanja village in uri to the ground .
they also know that zafar 's mother is nearly blind and largely immobile , and that the boy has two brothers who are called sajjad and nissar .
that is where zafar 's story ends .
dealing with grief the psychologists from medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- attending to him are not asking him any more questions , in case the boy goes into shock . "
i want to go home .
home is better " zafar khan people drop into the hospital ward and gift zafar colourful playthings - a plastic hockey stick , plastic balls , crayons , colouring books , even fancy shades .
doctors have put zafar 's bed next to two brothers , imtiaz , 12 and ishtiaq , six , neighbours and playmates from the same village , who are now recovering in the same ward .
the brothers got hurt when their house collapsed on them .
imtiaz has a fractured leg , and ishtiaq hurt his head and swam in and out of consciousness keeping doctors on tenterhooks for the first few days .
a week later , the three boys are getting better , and even playing mock hockey games with their plastic toys on their hospital beds .
imtiaz , says a counsellor , is dealing with grief directly .
he says one of his sisters is dead , his friends are dead , elders are dead - without betraying much emotion .
zafar is the most playful of the lot , humming rhymes , singing songs and even putting on the black plastic shades to impress visitors .
" i want to go home .
home is better , " he says smiling weakly .
while his ward mates , imtiaz and ishtiaq , will certainly go home in the near future with their father , zafar may have nobody to go with .
a week after the quake , no relative has arrived at the hospital to claim the boy and be with him .
" the hospital is planning to send him to a youth hostel if nobody comes to claim him after he recovers , " says arooj , a msf volunteer , who spends time with zafar .
zafar khan is one of the killer quake 's many nowhere children , who face distressingly uncertain futures .
learning to write fate could not have been crueller to 15-year-old mumtaz ahmed and his seven-year-old sister rubeena , who have been left holding each other . "
you had a problem with your arm , sister .
so the doctors had to cut it off " mumtaz ahmed they became orphans when both their parents died of illnesses in a matter of months in the past two years .
the loss of parents meant that mumtaz , the eldest of six siblings , including a disabled sister , took care of a family of children .
he worked as a daily wage labourer and ran the small family farm to make ends meet .
at least , the orphaned family had a roof over their heads .
last week , the quake swallowed their house and left rubeena severely wounded with a crushed right hand .
six days after she was airlifted to the hospital , accompanied by mumtaz , the doctors amputated her right hand after it began rotting .
" you had a problem with your arm , sister .
so the doctors had to cut it off , " mumtaz told his sister when she came out of the anaesthesia and began sobbing quietly on seeing her right arm gone .
he has also given rubeena some paper on which the pained girl has already begun to scribble the alphabet using her left hand .
" look , she is already using her left hand ! " says mumtaz .
week-long search the penniless orphans are too dazed to think about the future and the fate of their four siblings who may or may not have survived the quake .
" my siblings must be in the farm .
they must have camped there .
i do n't really know , " says mumtaz .
a local bank gave him $ 23 to meet some expenses ; the government , of course , has still not come with any help .
so where does he take his sister back to when she recovers ?
" i do n't know .
i need a tent to house my siblings and look after them .
if i do n't get one , maybe i will build a small bunker , " says mumtaz .
other children like ifra lone , 10 , and her sister tabassum , 14 , are luckier - there is somebody in the family by their side .
airlifted out of their tangdhar village with head , back and leg injuries after the quake , they were looking like becoming nowhere children until their uncle turned up at the hospital yesterday after a week-long search .
they also found out that another sister faizana , 9 , is recovering from injuries in another hospital with their father by her side .
other children like eight-year-old bilal ali khan and his brother majaz , six , from tangdar , are still waiting to meet their parents , but keep their spirits up by doodling on notebooks .
miracle recovery in a neighbouring bed , shaida bano , 12 , has even drawn a picture of the quake in her mind - a house shaking and a man with body parts showing , straight out of a junior school biology book .
or 12-year-old riaz ahmed who has managed to write a short story in urdu about his quake experiences from his hospital bed .
" i had to write it because i was so scared .
i feel scared even now when they move the hospital bed , " he says .
there is some flickering reaffirmation of life in the middle of death in the gloomy hospital wards too .
when seven-year-old mohammed altaf was taken out of the debris of his family house in uri and airlifted to the hospital , he was in a coma .
his mother , taaja , who came with him , was in shock , having lost her 15-day-old daughter in the rubble , and her son sinking fast .
a week later , altaf has recovered miraculously .
he is saluting and grinning at visitors and his mother is happy to take him back to their tent home .
" i am happy to go back now , " says taaja .
zafar khan may never have that luxury .

the medics have very few clues about the family of this wounded boy who was airlifted to a hospital in srinagar , summer capital of indian-administered kashmir , from his quake devastated village in uri .
what they do know from some of the boy 's neighbours who are attending to their injured relatives in the same hospital is that zafar 's father died in last saturday 's earthquake which razed dalanja village in uri to the ground .
they also know that zafar 's mother is nearly blind and largely immobile , and that the boy has two brothers who are called sajjad and nissar .
that is where zafar 's story ends .
dealing with grief the psychologists from medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- attending to him are not asking him any more questions , in case the boy goes into shock .
i want to go home .
home is better zafar khan people drop into the hospital ward and gift zafar colourful playthings - a plastic hockey stick , plastic balls , crayons , colouring books , even fancy shades .
doctors have put zafar 's bed next to two brothers , imtiaz , 12 and ishtiaq , six , neighbours and playmates from the same village , who are now recovering in the same ward .
the brothers got hurt when their house collapsed on them .
imtiaz has a fractured leg , and ishtiaq hurt his head and swam in and out of consciousness keeping doctors on tenterhooks for the first few days .
a week later , the three boys are getting better , and even playing mock hockey games with their plastic toys on their hospital beds .
imtiaz , says a counsellor , is dealing with grief directly .
he says one of his sisters is dead , his friends are dead , elders are dead - without betraying much emotion .
zafar is the most playful of the lot , humming rhymes , singing songs and even putting on the black plastic shades to impress visitors .
shaida has drawn her experience " i want to go home .
home is better , " he says smiling weakly .
while his ward mates , imtiaz and ishtiaq , will certainly go home in the near future with their father , zafar may have nobody to go with .
a week after the quake , no relative has arrived at the hospital to claim the boy and be with him .
" the hospital is planning to send him to a youth hostel if nobody comes to claim him after he recovers , " says arooj , a msf volunteer , who spends time with zafar .
zafar khan is one of the killer quake 's many nowhere children , who face distressingly uncertain futures .
learning to write fate could not have been crueller to 15-year-old mumtaz ahmed and his seven-year-old sister rubeena , who have been left holding each other .
you had a problem with your arm , sister .
so the doctors had to cut it off mumtaz ahmed they became orphans when both their parents died of illnesses in a matter of months in the past two years .
the loss of parents meant that mumtaz , the eldest of six siblings , including a disabled sister , took care of a family of children .
he worked as a daily wage labourer and ran the small family farm to make ends meet .
at least , the orphaned family had a roof over their heads .
last week , the quake swallowed their house and left rubeena severely wounded with a crushed right hand .
six days after she was airlifted to the hospital , accompanied by mumtaz , the doctors amputated her right hand after it began rotting .
" you had a problem with your arm , sister .
so the doctors had to cut it off , " mumtaz told his sister when she came out of the anaesthesia and began sobbing quietly on seeing her right arm gone .
he has also given rubeena some paper on which the pained girl has already begun to scribble the alphabet using her left hand .
" look , she is already using her left hand ! " says mumtaz .
week-long search the penniless orphans are too dazed to think about the future and the fate of their four siblings who may or may not have survived the quake .
" my siblings must be in the farm .
they must have camped there .
i do n't really know , " says mumtaz .
majaz , six , is still hoping his parents will turn up a local bank gave him $ 23 to meet some expenses ; the government , of course , has still not come with any help .
so where does he take his sister back to when she recovers ?
" i do n't know .
i need a tent to house my siblings and look after them .
if i do n't get one , maybe i will build a small bunker , " says mumtaz .
other children like ifra lone , 10 , and her sister tabassum , 14 , are luckier - there is somebody in the family by their side .
airlifted out of their tangdhar village with head , back and leg injuries after the quake , they were looking like becoming nowhere children until their uncle turned up at the hospital yesterday after a week-long search .
they also found out that another sister faizana , 9 , is recovering from injuries in another hospital with their father by her side .
other children like eight-year-old bilal ali khan and his brother majaz , six , from tangdar , are still waiting to meet their parents , but keep their spirits up by doodling on notebooks .
miracle recovery in a neighbouring bed , shaida bano , 12 , has even drawn a picture of the quake in her mind - a house shaking and a man with body parts showing , straight out of a junior school biology book .
altaf is now on the mend or 12-year-old riaz ahmed who has managed to write a short story in urdu about his quake experiences from his hospital bed .
" i had to write it because i was so scared .
i feel scared even now when they move the hospital bed , " he says .
there is some flickering reaffirmation of life in the middle of death in the gloomy hospital wards too .
when seven-year-old mohammed altaf was taken out of the debris of his family house in uri and airlifted to the hospital , he was in a coma .
his mother , taaja , who came with him , was in shock , having lost her 15-day-old daughter in the rubble , and her son sinking fast .
a week later , altaf has recovered miraculously .
he is saluting and grinning at visitors and his mother is happy to take him back to their tent home .
" i am happy to go back now , " says taaja .
zafar khan may never have that luxury .

airlift lifeline a state of emergency has been declared in all 61 municipalities of brazil 's amazonas state as the drought has started affecting towns and cities further downstream , reports the bbc 's tom gibb in sao paolo .
brazil 's armed forces have been delivering water , food and medical supplies to communities isolated by the worst drought in the amazon for decades .
the air force has been distributing water-purifying chemicals to counter the threat of disease from water supplies contaminated by dead fish in the amazon .
low river levels are preventing boats - for many the only means of transport - from using the amazon safely , leaving communities depending on government airlifts for their survival .
big ships have been left stranded in the world 's second-largest river and millions of fish are rotting in the sun , witnesses say .

star trek actor james doohan , who played scotty in the series , will have his final wish granted when his ashes are sent into space on 6 december .
doohan died of alzheimer 's disease and pneumonia in july , aged 85 .
his ashes will be accompanied by thousands of tributes from fans of the sci-fi show .
" james spent so much time with fans and many want to come to his space blast , " a space services inc spokeswoman said .
the firm will fire the ashes into orbit from a california air force base .
' absolutely adored ' " jimmy absolutely adored playing the role of scotty on star trek , " said his widow wende doohan in a letter to fans .
" he would have given almost anything to be able to actually go into space .
" he finally gets his wish , i ca n't think of a more fitting send off than having some of his fans attend this , his final journey . "
doohan -lrb- left -rrb- starred with william shatner in star trek mrs doohan invited fans to contribute extra tribute messages via the space services inc website , " to honour him on his journey to earth orbit " .
messages will be digitised and put onto a disc that will be included in the rocket that carries doohan 's remains into space from vandenberg air force base .
the texas company previously sent the ashes of star trek creator gene roddenberry and 1960s drug guru timothy leary into space .
doohan 's star trek character scotty manned the starship enterprise with captain james t kirk , played by shatner , and mr spock , played by leonard nimoy .
the original crew lasted for three series , starting in 1966 , before the show was axed , but the team reunited for seven big screen movies .
' beam me up ' although doohan became synonymous with the line " beam me up , scotty " , it was never actually said in the series .
the closest captain kirk came to saying it was in the fourth star trek movie , when he said " scotty , beam me up " .
canadian-born doohan had been a successful character actor on radio and tv before landing the role in the pilot star trek episode .
he quickly became typecast as the scottish space engineer , finding it difficult to get other roles , but he learned to embrace his place in sci-fi history .
his final public appearance was in october 2004 when he received a star on the hollywood walk of fame .

enlarge image a welsh zoo has successfully bred hundreds of tiny rare seahorses .
visitors to anglesey sea zoo can see some of the short-snouted seahorse -lrb- hippocampus hippocampus -rrb- for the first time on saturday .
the babies - or fry - were just 5-7mm -lrb- 0.19 - 0.27in -rrb- long when they were born three months ago .
three of the original 300 born will be on display at the zoo , which is part of a worldwide project to protect endangered seahorses .
the short-snouted seahorse is found in the mediterranean and in uk waters .
they live around eelgrass beds and because they do not move much they are often missed by divers .
staff at the zoo are delighted the creatures are now around 35mm -lrb- 1.37in -rrb- long , and so large enough to make their first public appearance .
putting the fry in a different tank has helped their nurturing curator karen tuson said they could be told apart from one another because they had slightly different markings .
the seahorses had proved difficult to rear in the past , but the team now belive they have eliminated problems which had caused earlier hatchlings to die .
the zoo has had success with other species of seahorse , but short-snouts are particularly small .
" they are usually born overnight . , " ms tuson said .
" we come in the morning and they are there in the tank .
" in the tank we were keeping them in before , we were finding dead space where the water and food was n't moving .
the seahorses were getting trapped . "
' dance together ' the new , smaller , tanks have an air tube down the side , which keeps the water moving and breaks up the surface tension .
this means the fry are not stuck at the surface , unable to descend .
the zoo brought in five adults - four males and one female - from ireland earlier this year .
the female has mated with the same male on each occasion and staff at the site have watched the mating ritual .
ms tuson said : " they do a wonderful dance together .
they are very active .
it is usually in the mornings .
chinese medicine " what they will do is entwine their tails and rise up and down in the tank .
sometimes the male will go over to the female and he 'll basically almost drag her around the tank .
" he has to persevere , and she has to be ready and have eggs that are viable which she will give him . "
the zoo hopes to exchange some of its growing population with fellow institutions involved in protecting seahorse populations .
at least 20 million seahorses are taken from the sea each year to meet the demands of chinese medicine , where they are highly prized as treatment for asthma , lethargy and impotence .
next month the zoo is hosting a national aquarium workshop , with more than 100 delegates from public aquaria nationwide .

shareholders were unable to persuade a judge that former transport secretary stephen byers acted maliciously and actively sought the firm 's collapse .
asked about the ruling , mr windsor said it was " abundantly clear " that mr byers had not acted maliciously .
railtrack went into administration in october 2001 .
the government had withdrawn the company 's funding in the aftermath of the fatal hatfield crash in 2000 .
both mr byers and the government had always denied any wrongdoing .
his -lsb- stephen byers ' -rsb- explanation as then given seems to me little above gibberish mr justice lindsay despite the failure of the shareholders ' £ 157m compensation case , mr byers could yet face censure from the house of commons .
during the trial it was revealed that he had earlier misled a commons sub-committee .
speaking at the high court on friday , mr justice lindsay said it was for parliament , and not him , to decide whether mr byers was a liar or not .
" his explanation as then given seems to me little above gibberish , but it will be for parliament to assess what he meant , " said the judge .
" i do not find mr byers generally to have been an untruthful witness . "
' political impatience ' mr winsor said the injury to shareholders was a " by-product " of mr byers ' actions , rather than the reason for his behaviour .
however , the former regulator argued that mr byers had been guilty of " political impatience " , adding that the government " jumped the gun " by putting the company into administration .
stephen byers has described the verdict as ' a great victory ' mr winsor said : " railtrack was a seriously unsatisfactory company .
it had a hostility to its customers ... -lsb- and -rsb- ... it had a policy of neglect of its assets - it did n't have cost control . "
he added : " we do now have an improved railway system .
" we do have sharply falling costs , significantly improved efficiency , much better punctuality and reliability and some of the best track quality results and measures in europe . "
however , he said these improvements were not necessarily due to mr byers ' actions , but industry reforms and improved management .
mr byers described the verdict as " a great victory " .
" the railtrack shareholders put my honesty and integrity at the heart of their case and the court has found in my favour , " he said in a statement after the court ruling .
" this legal action was a political attack on my decision to deny railtrack yet more taxpayers ' money .
throughout this whole affair i have put the public interest first . "
the civil lawsuit was brought by the 49,000-strong railtrack private shareholders action group , in the name of retired railtrack engineer geoffrey weir .
geoffrey weir said the shareholder group may now appeal mr weir said the shareholders were now considering whether they had grounds for appeal after being " disappointed and perplexed " by the ruling .
under cross-examination by mps , mr byers was asked if he had begun discussing the demise of railtrack before a key meeting in july 2001 , at which the company 's chairman warned mr byers of the financial difficulties .
mr byers told mps that he had not , but during the high court case he admitted " it is true to say there was work going on , so yes that was untrue " .
railtrack was replaced by not-for-profit company network rail in 2002 .
railtrack was formed in april 1994 after the privatisation of the uk railway network by the then conservative government of john major .
many small investors snapped up shares when it floated on the london stock exchange in 1996 .
the group 's shares climbed as high as 1768 pence each , but were eventually suspended at 280p each when it went into administration in 2001 .
institutional shareholders accepted the government 's eventual compensation offer of about 250p a share , but the private shareholders wanted much more .

mr byers described the verdict as " a great victory " .
" the railtrack shareholders put my honesty and integrity at the heart of their case and the court has found in my favour , " he said in a statement after the court ruling .
" this legal action was a political attack on my decision to deny railtrack yet more taxpayers ' money .
throughout this whole affair i have put the public interest first . "
the civil lawsuit was brought by the 49,000-strong railtrack private shareholders action group , in the name of retired railtrack engineer geoffrey weir .
mr weir said the shareholders were now considering whether they had grounds for appeal after being " disappointed and perplexed " by the ruling .
under cross-examination by mps , mr byers was asked if he had begun discussing the demise of railtrack before a key meeting in july 2001 , at which the company 's chairman warned mr byers of the financial difficulties .
mr byers told mps that he had not , but during the high court case he admitted " it is true to say there was work going on , so yes that was untrue " .
railtrack was replaced by not-for-profit company network rail in 2002 .
railtrack was formed in april 1994 after the privatisation of the uk railway network by the then conservative government of john major .
many small investors snapped up shares when it floated on the london stock exchange in 1996 .
the group 's shares climbed as high as 1768 pence each , but were eventually suspended at 280p each when it went into administration in 2001 .
institutional shareholders accepted the government 's eventual compensation offer of about 250p a share , but the private shareholders wanted much more .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- how should we tackle drugs ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 15 october 2005 , 10:55 gmt 11:55 uk how should we tackle drugs ?
does society have the right attitude to drug taking or is it time for a new approach ?
recent government figures indicate that more than a third of british people have taken drugs in their lifetime - mainly cannabis .
the subject of drugs has been in the spotlight again with stories about kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse .
however , drugs minister paul goggins has called for the debate to move beyond headlines about celebrities and become more mature .
how should drug use be dealt with ?
is it possible to strike a balance between punishment and treatment ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : " this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe " angela , london for over 11 years of working as a psychotherapist , i have worked with many clients / patients who are , from their own wording , addicted to cannabis or are suffering from the effects of the drug .
it causes mood swings , inability to relax unaided by the drug , paranoia , psychosis , insomnia , depression , anxiety and panic attacks , to name but a few of its side-effects .
i would never have believed it until i witnessed this first hand .
over and over again .
without any doubt , this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe .
i certainly wo n't be indulging and i would n't want any of my future children to either .
we are going to regret our softly , softly approach in years to come .
angela , london has anyone actually considered why people take drugs ?
in my experience it 's because people are bored .
what is truly stimulating about our lives ?
tv , computers and all other forms of multimedia ...
i do n't think so .
drugs are taken to find an alternative form of reality , something which mankind has been doing for a millennia .
prohibition only makes drug use more dangerous .
claire , brighton , uk i use cannabis but have never been tempted to use anything else .
i do n't smoke cigarettes on their own and i do n't touch alcohol .
i work full time in a good job and have 3 children and have no adverse effects .
i think cannabis availability should be like in amsterdam where you can buy it ready made or from vending machines .
ban smoking in public if needs be but also ban drinking as well so all drug and alcohol usage will be in the home and not outside where the majority of problems are caused .
hard drugs , coke and heroin i can not comment on but these , in my opinion , are more dangerous .
tamika , london , uk " it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work " ian , lancashire i work full time in the legal system .
i do n't enjoy drinking as i sometimes become aggressive .
i enjoy a joint or 2 in the evening at home with my wife .
it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work .
i could lose my home and career if i was caught , however it is still fine to get drunk in public and become an obnoxious neanderthal .
is that what the government wants me to return too ?
ian , lancashire some people enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner , others end up hopeless alcoholics .
in the same way , some people use drugs responsibly and other end up addicts .

drugs are not a modern problem .
mankind has been using drugs for thousands of years .

that just puts the whole market underground , and that market will always be there regardless of the state officials and other moralists who do n't like it .
i do n't want my taxes wasted on criminalising people who want to indulge in chemically-assisted recreation .
what i do want is a society which has enough going for it that people do n't need to escape on a trip , and that includes being less vindictive against those unfortunate enough to get addicted .
drugs of various kinds have been around for centuries , but the only time we have noticed a " problem " with them is when they became illegal .
phil , uk " legalise , tax and strictly control the supply " alison , leeds , uk making dangerous drugs illegal does not stop people from taking them and ruining their lives as a consequence .
legalise , tax and strictly control the supply .
this can be used to help educate users and offer safer , cleaner supplies to people who are currently taking their lives into their own hands with their addiction .
if we remove the criminal element from the cycle , more people can live safely and hopefully get the help they need to live cleanly .
alison , leeds , uk i 'm 30 , i have a full time job and have worked since leaving school .
i pay my taxes , i pay my bills and after a hard day at work i go home and have a few joints of cannabis instead of a few pints of beer .
this is my choice of how i want to relax and socialise .
i stay in my own home with friends and family , i 'm not out on the streets vandalising and abusing passers by intoxicated on alcohol .
but unfortunately i am classed as a criminal .
alex , surrey uk we must legalise all drugs , and the manufacture and sale of them should be taxed and regulated by the government .
purity , quality and quantity would be uniform and if prices were kept low the multi-million pound illegal drugs market would collapse overnight .
it would greatly reduced addict-related petty crime , and drastically reduce gun crime between feuding drug gangs .
sarah , se london " yet another area where schools need to play a part " deb , uk unfortunately this is yet another area where schools need to play a part .
they already do this through pshe and no doubt some parents wo n't like it , but if children are educated about drugs in an age appropriate way and taught assertiveness techniques to help them say " no " , hopefully they will be better equipped to be drug free adults .
there needs to be an investment at that level .
much cheaper than paying for rehabilitation and the cost of drug related crime .
deb , uk drugs are a fact of modern society .
i believe that they should be treated like tobacco .
legalise it , tax it , prohibit it , educate against it .
that may cut crime and deglamourise it .
david stevens , nottingham , england legalise - simple !
scott , leeds , uk even those of us who condemn drug abuse , who have never used or intend to use drugs and who educate our children in the dangers of using drugs can not help but notice the increase in violence surrounding the trading of illegal narcotics .
the gun crime and gun ownership is now more terrifying than the drugs themselves and is surely moving the debate into new areas .
lorraine , st albans , uk if alcohol is free , taxed and widely available , i do n't see why drugs should not .
pascal , cambridge , uk i 'm 19 years old and currently hold a job in it .
many of my friends also hold a respectable job like me and pay tax like any other citizen .
i do n't drink alcohol .
i am , however , a recreational drug user , like many of my friends .
we do n't go out pubbing / clubbing at the weekend , that 's not my scene .
i find the atmosphere too aggressive , too competitive .
you ca n't look at anyone without risking a fight .
i just want to relax with my mates .
however , not everyone can handle certain drugs , and all drugs have different risks .
the government will never be able to stamp out illegal drug use so they should be looking to support those who want / need help and those who do n't ... leave them be as long as they do n't cause trouble to society .

does society have the right attitude to drug taking or is it time for a new approach ?
recent government figures indicate that more than a third of british people have taken drugs in their lifetime - mainly cannabis .
the subject of drugs has been in the spotlight again with stories about kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse .
however , drugs minister paul goggins has called for the debate to move beyond headlines about celebrities and become more mature .
how should drug use be dealt with ?
is it possible to strike a balance between punishment and treatment ?

it causes mood swings , inability to relax unaided by the drug , paranoia , psychosis , insomnia , depression , anxiety and panic attacks , to name but a few of its side-effects .
i would never have believed it until i witnessed this first hand .
over and over again .
without any doubt , this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe .
i certainly wo n't be indulging and i would n't want any of my future children to either .

i do n't think so .
drugs are taken to find an alternative form of reality , something which mankind has been doing for a millennia .
prohibition only makes drug use more dangerous .
claire , brighton , uk i use cannabis but have never been tempted to use anything else .
i do n't smoke cigarettes on their own and i do n't touch alcohol .
i work full time in a good job and have 3 children and have no adverse effects .
i think cannabis availability should be like in amsterdam where you can buy it ready made or from vending machines .
ban smoking in public if needs be but also ban drinking as well so all drug and alcohol usage will be in the home and not outside where the majority of problems are caused .
hard drugs , coke and heroin i can not comment on but these , in my opinion , are more dangerous .

rob , corby , england i wonder if people would be so eager to legalise drugs if it were their children that had died due to drug addiction ?

drugs are not a modern problem .
mankind has been using drugs for thousands of years .
from the egyptians to the romans to our modern day artists , drugs have influenced our society .
do not make criminals out of ordinary folk .
how many times do we hear " terror groups " get their funding from drug money ?
why not remove this source of income and use it to benefit society ?

legalise , let people see for themselves how cool being a drug addict is .
simon soaper , england as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal , there is no argument whatsoever .
drugs must be legal too .
the sheer hypocrisy and irrationality of this surmounts any discussion .
tom franklin , london , uk the answer is certainly not prohibition .
that just puts the whole market underground , and that market will always be there regardless of the state officials and other moralists who do n't like it .
i do n't want my taxes wasted on criminalising people who want to indulge in chemically-assisted recreation .
what i do want is a society which has enough going for it that people do n't need to escape on a trip , and that includes being less vindictive against those unfortunate enough to get addicted .
drugs of various kinds have been around for centuries , but the only time we have noticed a " problem " with them is when they became illegal .
phil , uk legalise , tax and strictly control the supply alison , leeds , uk making dangerous drugs illegal does not stop people from taking them and ruining their lives as a consequence .
legalise , tax and strictly control the supply .
this can be used to help educate users and offer safer , cleaner supplies to people who are currently taking their lives into their own hands with their addiction .
if we remove the criminal element from the cycle , more people can live safely and hopefully get the help they need to live cleanly .
alison , leeds , uk i 'm 30 , i have a full time job and have worked since leaving school .
i pay my taxes , i pay my bills and after a hard day at work i go home and have a few joints of cannabis instead of a few pints of beer .
this is my choice of how i want to relax and socialise .
i stay in my own home with friends and family , i 'm not out on the streets vandalising and abusing passers by intoxicated on alcohol .
but unfortunately i am classed as a criminal .
alex , surrey uk we must legalise all drugs , and the manufacture and sale of them should be taxed and regulated by the government .
purity , quality and quantity would be uniform and if prices were kept low the multi-million pound illegal drugs market would collapse overnight .
it would greatly reduced addict-related petty crime , and drastically reduce gun crime between feuding drug gangs .
sarah , se london yet another area where schools need to play a part deb , uk unfortunately this is yet another area where schools need to play a part .
they already do this through pshe and no doubt some parents wo n't like it , but if children are educated about drugs in an age appropriate way and taught assertiveness techniques to help them say " no " , hopefully they will be better equipped to be drug free adults .
there needs to be an investment at that level .
much cheaper than paying for rehabilitation and the cost of drug related crime .
deb , uk drugs are a fact of modern society .
i believe that they should be treated like tobacco .
legalise it , tax it , prohibit it , educate against it .
that may cut crime and deglamourise it .
david stevens , nottingham , england legalise - simple !
scott , leeds , uk even those of us who condemn drug abuse , who have never used or intend to use drugs and who educate our children in the dangers of using drugs can not help but notice the increase in violence surrounding the trading of illegal narcotics .
the gun crime and gun ownership is now more terrifying than the drugs themselves and is surely moving the debate into new areas .
lorraine , st albans , uk if alcohol is free , taxed and widely available , i do n't see why drugs should not .
pascal , cambridge , uk i 'm 19 years old and currently hold a job in it .
many of my friends also hold a respectable job like me and pay tax like any other citizen .
i do n't drink alcohol .
i am , however , a recreational drug user , like many of my friends .
we do n't go out pubbing / clubbing at the weekend , that 's not my scene .
i find the atmosphere too aggressive , too competitive .
you ca n't look at anyone without risking a fight .
i just want to relax with my mates .
however , not everyone can handle certain drugs , and all drugs have different risks .
the government will never be able to stamp out illegal drug use so they should be looking to support those who want / need help and those who do n't ... leave them be as long as they do n't cause trouble to society .

does society have the right attitude to drug taking or is it time for a new approach ?
recent government figures indicate that more than a third of british people have taken drugs in their lifetime - mainly cannabis .
the subject of drugs has been in the spotlight again with stories about kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse .
however , drugs minister paul goggins has called for the debate to move beyond headlines about celebrities and become more mature .
how should drug use be dealt with ?
is it possible to strike a balance between punishment and treatment ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe angela , london for over 11 years of working as a psychotherapist , i have worked with many clients / patients who are , from their own wording , addicted to cannabis or are suffering from the effects of the drug .
it causes mood swings , inability to relax unaided by the drug , paranoia , psychosis , insomnia , depression , anxiety and panic attacks , to name but a few of its side-effects .
i would never have believed it until i witnessed this first hand .
over and over again .
without any doubt , this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe .
i certainly wo n't be indulging and i would n't want any of my future children to either .
we are going to regret our softly , softly approach in years to come .
angela , london has anyone actually considered why people take drugs ?
in my experience it 's because people are bored .
what is truly stimulating about our lives ?
tv , computers and all other forms of multimedia ...
i do n't think so .
drugs are taken to find an alternative form of reality , something which mankind has been doing for a millennia .
prohibition only makes drug use more dangerous .
claire , brighton , uk i use cannabis but have never been tempted to use anything else .
i do n't smoke cigarettes on their own and i do n't touch alcohol .
i work full time in a good job and have 3 children and have no adverse effects .
i think cannabis availability should be like in amsterdam where you can buy it ready made or from vending machines .
ban smoking in public if needs be but also ban drinking as well so all drug and alcohol usage will be in the home and not outside where the majority of problems are caused .
hard drugs , coke and heroin i can not comment on but these , in my opinion , are more dangerous .
tamika , london , uk it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work ian , lancashire i work full time in the legal system .
i do n't enjoy drinking as i sometimes become aggressive .
i enjoy a joint or 2 in the evening at home with my wife .
it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work .
i could lose my home and career if i was caught , however it is still fine to get drunk in public and become an obnoxious neanderthal .
is that what the government wants me to return too ?
ian , lancashire some people enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner , others end up hopeless alcoholics .
in the same way , some people use drugs responsibly and other end up addicts .
i am in the highest tax bracket , own my own home and contribute to several charities .
yet because i prefer drugs to wine , i am classed as a criminal ?
drugs are only kept illegal to boost the profits of the booze and prescription medicine trade .
prozac anyone ?
dave b , london current drug abatement policy is absurd .
i agree with others who suggest that regulation of the sale of cannabis is more sensible than criminalising usage .
hard drugs are another matter , but again , why ruin a life by imprisoning the user ?
treatment is more humane , more sensible and will ultimately be better for society as well as the individual addict .
barbie , florida , usa although keeping drugs illegal may not solve all problems , it is considerably better than the alternative .
with all the alcohol-related problems that are rife in britain , it seems staggering to argue that drugs should be legal because alcohol is .
if anything , the responsible move would be in the opposite direction , with stiffer penalties for drunken behaviour .
stephen , philadelphia , usa what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use michael , utrecht , netherlands drug policy should be reviewed in a holistic way , rather than the focus on this or that drug .
many drugs that are illegal today do less direct harm than many legal drugs .
what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use ?
prohibition in the 20 's gave rise to decades of organized crime and prohibition today is doing the same to a whole new generation of real criminals .
michael , utrecht , netherlands if class a drugs were to be legalised then presumably people would be able to indulge in pubs , restaurants , on public transport etc .
would this be deemed acceptable to the public at large ?
i doubt it .
tony jennings , liverpool , england by insisting on a head-in-the-sand approach that refuses to concede that young people will always use drugs , the government is morally responsible for the harm that comes to them when they use impure substances pedalled by unscrupulous individuals .
to legalise all drugs , however , would be foolhardy unless it is done in a controlled environment .
adam sulkowski , london , england ban alcohol and cigarettes first nat , london , uk as long as this government feeds us lies , people will ignore all the drug advice .
they moan about ecstasy being deadly , yet thousands of ecstasy tablets are taken every weekend in clubs around the country , with no bad effects .
we ca n't say that about alcohol .
isolated deaths do not make something a fundamental danger to society .
consistent deaths and illness does - so ban alcohol and cigarettes first .
then we might start listening to a valid argument , not a torrent of contradiction from the department of health .
nat , london , uk having used cannabis medicinally for five years and knowing many people whose lives are made bearable by the substance , i must say that anyone who advocates prohibition is irresponsible and stupid .
reverend paul farnhill , manchester , uk i used to manage a cannabis addict who would never drink , and who would rather be in a full room of people loved up on drugs than in a pub -lrb- because alcohol caused violent behaviour -rrb- .
i had to physically restrain him from attacking another member of staff .
i had to handle his threats of violence against another member of staff .
i had to deal with his paranoia , his mood swings , his threats , his tears , his tantrums , his demands .
in the end , i left the job i loved because i could not take the stress of having to deal with him every day .
and this from a " soft drug " that everyone seems to suggest does no harm ?
graham , bedfordshire over the years , there has been far more harm caused by alcohol and cigarettes than by the use of cannabis .
but the government wo n't ban alcohol cigarettes because of the revenue it produces .
if you ban cannabis you must ban the other two .
since this will not happen , cannabis ought to be legalised in the same way .
but then this would only make a " right " out of three wrongs instead of just two .

alison , leeds , uk i 'm 30 , i have a full time job and have worked since leaving school .
i pay my taxes , i pay my bills and after a hard day at work i go home and have a few joints of cannabis instead of a few pints of beer .

alex , surrey uk we must legalise all drugs , and the manufacture and sale of them should be taxed and regulated by the government .
purity , quality and quantity would be uniform and if prices were kept low the multi-million pound illegal drugs market would collapse overnight .
it would greatly reduced addict-related petty crime , and drastically reduce gun crime between feuding drug gangs .

they already do this through pshe and no doubt some parents wo n't like it , but if children are educated about drugs in an age appropriate way and taught assertiveness techniques to help them say " no " , hopefully they will be better equipped to be drug free adults .
there needs to be an investment at that level .
much cheaper than paying for rehabilitation and the cost of drug related crime .
deb , uk drugs are a fact of modern society .
i believe that they should be treated like tobacco .
legalise it , tax it , prohibit it , educate against it .
that may cut crime and deglamourise it .

recent government figures indicate that more than a third of british people have taken drugs in their lifetime - mainly cannabis .
the subject of drugs has been in the spotlight again with stories about kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse .
however , drugs minister paul goggins has called for the debate to move beyond headlines about celebrities and become more mature .
how should drug use be dealt with ?
is it possible to strike a balance between punishment and treatment ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe angela , london for over 11 years of working as a psychotherapist , i have worked with many clients / patients who are , from their own wording , addicted to cannabis or are suffering from the effects of the drug .
it causes mood swings , inability to relax unaided by the drug , paranoia , psychosis , insomnia , depression , anxiety and panic attacks , to name but a few of its side-effects .
i would never have believed it until i witnessed this first hand .
over and over again .
without any doubt , this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe .
i certainly wo n't be indulging and i would n't want any of my future children to either .
we are going to regret our softly , softly approach in years to come .
angela , london has anyone actually considered why people take drugs ?
in my experience it 's because people are bored .
what is truly stimulating about our lives ?
tv , computers and all other forms of multimedia ...
i do n't think so .
drugs are taken to find an alternative form of reality , something which mankind has been doing for a millennia .
prohibition only makes drug use more dangerous .
claire , brighton , uk i use cannabis but have never been tempted to use anything else .
i do n't smoke cigarettes on their own and i do n't touch alcohol .
i work full time in a good job and have 3 children and have no adverse effects .
i think cannabis availability should be like in amsterdam where you can buy it ready made or from vending machines .
ban smoking in public if needs be but also ban drinking as well so all drug and alcohol usage will be in the home and not outside where the majority of problems are caused .
hard drugs , coke and heroin i can not comment on but these , in my opinion , are more dangerous .
tamika , london , uk it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work ian , lancashire i work full time in the legal system .
i do n't enjoy drinking as i sometimes become aggressive .
i enjoy a joint or 2 in the evening at home with my wife .
it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work .
i could lose my home and career if i was caught , however it is still fine to get drunk in public and become an obnoxious neanderthal .
is that what the government wants me to return too ?
ian , lancashire some people enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner , others end up hopeless alcoholics .
in the same way , some people use drugs responsibly and other end up addicts .
i am in the highest tax bracket , own my own home and contribute to several charities .
yet because i prefer drugs to wine , i am classed as a criminal ?
drugs are only kept illegal to boost the profits of the booze and prescription medicine trade .
prozac anyone ?
dave b , london current drug abatement policy is absurd .
i agree with others who suggest that regulation of the sale of cannabis is more sensible than criminalising usage .
hard drugs are another matter , but again , why ruin a life by imprisoning the user ?
treatment is more humane , more sensible and will ultimately be better for society as well as the individual addict .
barbie , florida , usa although keeping drugs illegal may not solve all problems , it is considerably better than the alternative .
with all the alcohol-related problems that are rife in britain , it seems staggering to argue that drugs should be legal because alcohol is .
if anything , the responsible move would be in the opposite direction , with stiffer penalties for drunken behaviour .
stephen , philadelphia , usa what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use michael , utrecht , netherlands drug policy should be reviewed in a holistic way , rather than the focus on this or that drug .
many drugs that are illegal today do less direct harm than many legal drugs .
what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use ?
prohibition in the 20 's gave rise to decades of organized crime and prohibition today is doing the same to a whole new generation of real criminals .
michael , utrecht , netherlands if class a drugs were to be legalised then presumably people would be able to indulge in pubs , restaurants , on public transport etc .
would this be deemed acceptable to the public at large ?
i doubt it .
tony jennings , liverpool , england by insisting on a head-in-the-sand approach that refuses to concede that young people will always use drugs , the government is morally responsible for the harm that comes to them when they use impure substances pedalled by unscrupulous individuals .
to legalise all drugs , however , would be foolhardy unless it is done in a controlled environment .
adam sulkowski , london , england ban alcohol and cigarettes first nat , london , uk as long as this government feeds us lies , people will ignore all the drug advice .
they moan about ecstasy being deadly , yet thousands of ecstasy tablets are taken every weekend in clubs around the country , with no bad effects .
we ca n't say that about alcohol .
isolated deaths do not make something a fundamental danger to society .
consistent deaths and illness does - so ban alcohol and cigarettes first .
then we might start listening to a valid argument , not a torrent of contradiction from the department of health .
nat , london , uk having used cannabis medicinally for five years and knowing many people whose lives are made bearable by the substance , i must say that anyone who advocates prohibition is irresponsible and stupid .
reverend paul farnhill , manchester , uk i used to manage a cannabis addict who would never drink , and who would rather be in a full room of people loved up on drugs than in a pub -lrb- because alcohol caused violent behaviour -rrb- .
i had to physically restrain him from attacking another member of staff .
i had to handle his threats of violence against another member of staff .
i had to deal with his paranoia , his mood swings , his threats , his tears , his tantrums , his demands .
in the end , i left the job i loved because i could not take the stress of having to deal with him every day .
and this from a " soft drug " that everyone seems to suggest does no harm ?
graham , bedfordshire over the years , there has been far more harm caused by alcohol and cigarettes than by the use of cannabis .
but the government wo n't ban alcohol cigarettes because of the revenue it produces .
if you ban cannabis you must ban the other two .
since this will not happen , cannabis ought to be legalised in the same way .
but then this would only make a " right " out of three wrongs instead of just two .
martin snook , baldock , herts the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source myles , san francisco , usa trying to tackle the problem after the drugs are in the country will not work .
the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source .
until the governments of drug producing countries step up and stop this problem , it will always exist on our streets .
there is no other way .
myles , san francisco , usa having worked with teenagers whose minds and bodies have been irreparably damaged and their lives -lrb- and the lives of others -rrb- ruined by what started as recreational use , i must say that anyone who advocates legalisation is irresponsible and stupid .
mike , ivybridge , uk legalisation is the only way to take drugs away from criminal activity and to face up to the issue as an unavoidable recreation for so many in the uk .
for too long there has been the futile " war on drugs " and the governments fighting it have all lost , the dismal finale being the magic mushroom criminalisation as a class a drug over the summer .
it is now time to maturely face up to reality and tax substances according to their health risk , maintaining a clean , accessible supply for users .
lee d , newcastle , uk i am also one of those who prefer a ' crafty one ' in comfortable surroundings with a few mates .
this makes me very bias but i also know people who have created nothing but problems for themselves because of much harder substances .
alcohol should be at least a category b drug .
rob , corby , england i wonder if people would be so eager to legalise drugs if it were their children that had died due to drug addiction ?
drugs kill people , alcohol kills people , tobacco kills people .
make them all illegal .
just because people do it , does n't mean to say we should make it acceptable by legalising it .
d , west yorkshire learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work dave , london learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work .
drugs are not a modern problem .
mankind has been using drugs for thousands of years .
from the egyptians to the romans to our modern day artists , drugs have influenced our society .
do not make criminals out of ordinary folk .
how many times do we hear " terror groups " get their funding from drug money ?
why not remove this source of income and use it to benefit society ?
dave , london what stopped me taking heroin ?
the kids from grange hill or seeing a junkie dead in a doorway with a needle in their arm in amsterdam .
legalise , let people see for themselves how cool being a drug addict is .
simon soaper , england as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal , there is no argument whatsoever .
drugs must be legal too .
the sheer hypocrisy and irrationality of this surmounts any discussion .
tom franklin , london , uk the answer is certainly not prohibition .
that just puts the whole market underground , and that market will always be there regardless of the state officials and other moralists who do n't like it .
i do n't want my taxes wasted on criminalising people who want to indulge in chemically-assisted recreation .
what i do want is a society which has enough going for it that people do n't need to escape on a trip , and that includes being less vindictive against those unfortunate enough to get addicted .
drugs of various kinds have been around for centuries , but the only time we have noticed a " problem " with them is when they became illegal .
phil , uk legalise , tax and strictly control the supply alison , leeds , uk making dangerous drugs illegal does not stop people from taking them and ruining their lives as a consequence .

does society have the right attitude to drug taking or is it time for a new approach ?
recent government figures indicate that more than a third of british people have taken drugs in their lifetime - mainly cannabis .
the subject of drugs has been in the spotlight again with stories about kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse .
however , drugs minister paul goggins has called for the debate to move beyond headlines about celebrities and become more mature .
how should drug use be dealt with ?
is it possible to strike a balance between punishment and treatment ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe angela , london for over 11 years of working as a psychotherapist , i have worked with many clients / patients who are , from their own wording , addicted to cannabis or are suffering from the effects of the drug .
it causes mood swings , inability to relax unaided by the drug , paranoia , psychosis , insomnia , depression , anxiety and panic attacks , to name but a few of its side-effects .
i would never have believed it until i witnessed this first hand .
over and over again .
without any doubt , this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe .
i certainly wo n't be indulging and i would n't want any of my future children to either .
we are going to regret our softly , softly approach in years to come .
angela , london has anyone actually considered why people take drugs ?
in my experience it 's because people are bored .
what is truly stimulating about our lives ?
tv , computers and all other forms of multimedia ...
i do n't think so .
drugs are taken to find an alternative form of reality , something which mankind has been doing for a millennia .
prohibition only makes drug use more dangerous .
claire , brighton , uk i use cannabis but have never been tempted to use anything else .
i do n't smoke cigarettes on their own and i do n't touch alcohol .
i work full time in a good job and have 3 children and have no adverse effects .
i think cannabis availability should be like in amsterdam where you can buy it ready made or from vending machines .
ban smoking in public if needs be but also ban drinking as well so all drug and alcohol usage will be in the home and not outside where the majority of problems are caused .
hard drugs , coke and heroin i can not comment on but these , in my opinion , are more dangerous .
tamika , london , uk it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work ian , lancashire i work full time in the legal system .
i do n't enjoy drinking as i sometimes become aggressive .
i enjoy a joint or 2 in the evening at home with my wife .
it is my way of relaxing after a hard day 's work .
i could lose my home and career if i was caught , however it is still fine to get drunk in public and become an obnoxious neanderthal .
is that what the government wants me to return too ?
ian , lancashire some people enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner , others end up hopeless alcoholics .
in the same way , some people use drugs responsibly and other end up addicts .
i am in the highest tax bracket , own my own home and contribute to several charities .
yet because i prefer drugs to wine , i am classed as a criminal ?
drugs are only kept illegal to boost the profits of the booze and prescription medicine trade .
prozac anyone ?
dave b , london current drug abatement policy is absurd .
i agree with others who suggest that regulation of the sale of cannabis is more sensible than criminalising usage .
hard drugs are another matter , but again , why ruin a life by imprisoning the user ?
treatment is more humane , more sensible and will ultimately be better for society as well as the individual addict .
barbie , florida , usa although keeping drugs illegal may not solve all problems , it is considerably better than the alternative .
with all the alcohol-related problems that are rife in britain , it seems staggering to argue that drugs should be legal because alcohol is .
if anything , the responsible move would be in the opposite direction , with stiffer penalties for drunken behaviour .
stephen , philadelphia , usa what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use michael , utrecht , netherlands drug policy should be reviewed in a holistic way , rather than the focus on this or that drug .
many drugs that are illegal today do less direct harm than many legal drugs .
what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use ?
prohibition in the 20 's gave rise to decades of organized crime and prohibition today is doing the same to a whole new generation of real criminals .
michael , utrecht , netherlands if class a drugs were to be legalised then presumably people would be able to indulge in pubs , restaurants , on public transport etc .
would this be deemed acceptable to the public at large ?
i doubt it .
tony jennings , liverpool , england by insisting on a head-in-the-sand approach that refuses to concede that young people will always use drugs , the government is morally responsible for the harm that comes to them when they use impure substances pedalled by unscrupulous individuals .
to legalise all drugs , however , would be foolhardy unless it is done in a controlled environment .
adam sulkowski , london , england ban alcohol and cigarettes first nat , london , uk as long as this government feeds us lies , people will ignore all the drug advice .
they moan about ecstasy being deadly , yet thousands of ecstasy tablets are taken every weekend in clubs around the country , with no bad effects .
we ca n't say that about alcohol .
isolated deaths do not make something a fundamental danger to society .
consistent deaths and illness does - so ban alcohol and cigarettes first .
then we might start listening to a valid argument , not a torrent of contradiction from the department of health .
nat , london , uk having used cannabis medicinally for five years and knowing many people whose lives are made bearable by the substance , i must say that anyone who advocates prohibition is irresponsible and stupid .
reverend paul farnhill , manchester , uk i used to manage a cannabis addict who would never drink , and who would rather be in a full room of people loved up on drugs than in a pub -lrb- because alcohol caused violent behaviour -rrb- .
i had to physically restrain him from attacking another member of staff .
i had to handle his threats of violence against another member of staff .
i had to deal with his paranoia , his mood swings , his threats , his tears , his tantrums , his demands .
in the end , i left the job i loved because i could not take the stress of having to deal with him every day .
and this from a " soft drug " that everyone seems to suggest does no harm ?
graham , bedfordshire over the years , there has been far more harm caused by alcohol and cigarettes than by the use of cannabis .
but the government wo n't ban alcohol cigarettes because of the revenue it produces .
if you ban cannabis you must ban the other two .
since this will not happen , cannabis ought to be legalised in the same way .
but then this would only make a " right " out of three wrongs instead of just two .
martin snook , baldock , herts the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source myles , san francisco , usa trying to tackle the problem after the drugs are in the country will not work .
the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source .
until the governments of drug producing countries step up and stop this problem , it will always exist on our streets .
there is no other way .
myles , san francisco , usa having worked with teenagers whose minds and bodies have been irreparably damaged and their lives -lrb- and the lives of others -rrb- ruined by what started as recreational use , i must say that anyone who advocates legalisation is irresponsible and stupid .
mike , ivybridge , uk legalisation is the only way to take drugs away from criminal activity and to face up to the issue as an unavoidable recreation for so many in the uk .
for too long there has been the futile " war on drugs " and the governments fighting it have all lost , the dismal finale being the magic mushroom criminalisation as a class a drug over the summer .
it is now time to maturely face up to reality and tax substances according to their health risk , maintaining a clean , accessible supply for users .
lee d , newcastle , uk i am also one of those who prefer a ' crafty one ' in comfortable surroundings with a few mates .
this makes me very bias but i also know people who have created nothing but problems for themselves because of much harder substances .
alcohol should be at least a category b drug .
rob , corby , england i wonder if people would be so eager to legalise drugs if it were their children that had died due to drug addiction ?
drugs kill people , alcohol kills people , tobacco kills people .
make them all illegal .
just because people do it , does n't mean to say we should make it acceptable by legalising it .
d , west yorkshire learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work dave , london learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work .
drugs are not a modern problem .
mankind has been using drugs for thousands of years .
from the egyptians to the romans to our modern day artists , drugs have influenced our society .
do not make criminals out of ordinary folk .
how many times do we hear " terror groups " get their funding from drug money ?
why not remove this source of income and use it to benefit society ?
dave , london what stopped me taking heroin ?
the kids from grange hill or seeing a junkie dead in a doorway with a needle in their arm in amsterdam .
legalise , let people see for themselves how cool being a drug addict is .
simon soaper , england as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal , there is no argument whatsoever .
drugs must be legal too .
the sheer hypocrisy and irrationality of this surmounts any discussion .
tom franklin , london , uk the answer is certainly not prohibition .
that just puts the whole market underground , and that market will always be there regardless of the state officials and other moralists who do n't like it .
i do n't want my taxes wasted on criminalising people who want to indulge in chemically-assisted recreation .
what i do want is a society which has enough going for it that people do n't need to escape on a trip , and that includes being less vindictive against those unfortunate enough to get addicted .
drugs of various kinds have been around for centuries , but the only time we have noticed a " problem " with them is when they became illegal .
phil , uk legalise , tax and strictly control the supply alison , leeds , uk making dangerous drugs illegal does not stop people from taking them and ruining their lives as a consequence .
legalise , tax and strictly control the supply .
this can be used to help educate users and offer safer , cleaner supplies to people who are currently taking their lives into their own hands with their addiction .
if we remove the criminal element from the cycle , more people can live safely and hopefully get the help they need to live cleanly .
alison , leeds , uk i 'm 30 , i have a full time job and have worked since leaving school .
i pay my taxes , i pay my bills and after a hard day at work i go home and have a few joints of cannabis instead of a few pints of beer .
this is my choice of how i want to relax and socialise .
i stay in my own home with friends and family , i 'm not out on the streets vandalising and abusing passers by intoxicated on alcohol .
but unfortunately i am classed as a criminal .
alex , surrey uk we must legalise all drugs , and the manufacture and sale of them should be taxed and regulated by the government .
purity , quality and quantity would be uniform and if prices were kept low the multi-million pound illegal drugs market would collapse overnight .
it would greatly reduced addict-related petty crime , and drastically reduce gun crime between feuding drug gangs .
sarah , se london yet another area where schools need to play a part deb , uk unfortunately this is yet another area where schools need to play a part .
they already do this through pshe and no doubt some parents wo n't like it , but if children are educated about drugs in an age appropriate way and taught assertiveness techniques to help them say " no " , hopefully they will be better equipped to be drug free adults .
there needs to be an investment at that level .
much cheaper than paying for rehabilitation and the cost of drug related crime .
deb , uk drugs are a fact of modern society .
i believe that they should be treated like tobacco .
legalise it , tax it , prohibit it , educate against it .
that may cut crime and deglamourise it .
david stevens , nottingham , england legalise - simple !
scott , leeds , uk even those of us who condemn drug abuse , who have never used or intend to use drugs and who educate our children in the dangers of using drugs can not help but notice the increase in violence surrounding the trading of illegal narcotics .
the gun crime and gun ownership is now more terrifying than the drugs themselves and is surely moving the debate into new areas .
lorraine , st albans , uk if alcohol is free , taxed and widely available , i do n't see why drugs should not .
pascal , cambridge , uk i 'm 19 years old and currently hold a job in it .
many of my friends also hold a respectable job like me and pay tax like any other citizen .
i do n't drink alcohol .
i am , however , a recreational drug user , like many of my friends .
we do n't go out pubbing / clubbing at the weekend , that 's not my scene .
i find the atmosphere too aggressive , too competitive .
you ca n't look at anyone without risking a fight .
i just want to relax with my mates .
however , not everyone can handle certain drugs , and all drugs have different risks .
the government will never be able to stamp out illegal drug use so they should be looking to support those who want / need help and those who do n't ... leave them be as long as they do n't cause trouble to society .
mark , 19 , surrey , england e-mail this to a friend printable version uk 's drugs habit latest news call for ' smarter ' drugs policy un shows scale of uk cocaine use ' phoney ' uk drug war criticised drugs swoops ' have little impact ' background and features cheap cocaine as the price of cocaine falls , it is also becoming less pure .
new tactic in war on cocaine gangs how does cocaine get to the uk ?
heroin ' cheaper than a night out ' more women used as drug mules top have your say stories what will calm the violence in iran ?
was china right to execute briton ?
should airport security get tougher ?

is that what the government wants me to return too ?
ian , lancashire some people enjoy a glass of wine with their dinner , others end up hopeless alcoholics .
in the same way , some people use drugs responsibly and other end up addicts .
i am in the highest tax bracket , own my own home and contribute to several charities .
yet because i prefer drugs to wine , i am classed as a criminal ?
drugs are only kept illegal to boost the profits of the booze and prescription medicine trade .
prozac anyone ?
dave b , london current drug abatement policy is absurd .
i agree with others who suggest that regulation of the sale of cannabis is more sensible than criminalising usage .
hard drugs are another matter , but again , why ruin a life by imprisoning the user ?
treatment is more humane , more sensible and will ultimately be better for society as well as the individual addict .
barbie , florida , usa although keeping drugs illegal may not solve all problems , it is considerably better than the alternative .
with all the alcohol-related problems that are rife in britain , it seems staggering to argue that drugs should be legal because alcohol is .
if anything , the responsible move would be in the opposite direction , with stiffer penalties for drunken behaviour .
stephen , philadelphia , usa what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use michael , utrecht , netherlands drug policy should be reviewed in a holistic way , rather than the focus on this or that drug .
many drugs that are illegal today do less direct harm than many legal drugs .
what is more damaging to a drug user ?
a prison sentence and then a life of low paid employment or continued drug use ?
prohibition in the 20 's gave rise to decades of organized crime and prohibition today is doing the same to a whole new generation of real criminals .
michael , utrecht , netherlands if class a drugs were to be legalised then presumably people would be able to indulge in pubs , restaurants , on public transport etc .
would this be deemed acceptable to the public at large ?
i doubt it .
tony jennings , liverpool , england by insisting on a head-in-the-sand approach that refuses to concede that young people will always use drugs , the government is morally responsible for the harm that comes to them when they use impure substances pedalled by unscrupulous individuals .
to legalise all drugs , however , would be foolhardy unless it is done in a controlled environment .
adam sulkowski , london , england ban alcohol and cigarettes first nat , london , uk as long as this government feeds us lies , people will ignore all the drug advice .
they moan about ecstasy being deadly , yet thousands of ecstasy tablets are taken every weekend in clubs around the country , with no bad effects .
we ca n't say that about alcohol .
isolated deaths do not make something a fundamental danger to society .
consistent deaths and illness does - so ban alcohol and cigarettes first .
then we might start listening to a valid argument , not a torrent of contradiction from the department of health .
nat , london , uk having used cannabis medicinally for five years and knowing many people whose lives are made bearable by the substance , i must say that anyone who advocates prohibition is irresponsible and stupid .
reverend paul farnhill , manchester , uk i used to manage a cannabis addict who would never drink , and who would rather be in a full room of people loved up on drugs than in a pub -lrb- because alcohol caused violent behaviour -rrb- .
i had to physically restrain him from attacking another member of staff .
i had to handle his threats of violence against another member of staff .
i had to deal with his paranoia , his mood swings , his threats , his tears , his tantrums , his demands .
in the end , i left the job i loved because i could not take the stress of having to deal with him every day .
and this from a " soft drug " that everyone seems to suggest does no harm ?
graham , bedfordshire over the years , there has been far more harm caused by alcohol and cigarettes than by the use of cannabis .
but the government wo n't ban alcohol cigarettes because of the revenue it produces .
if you ban cannabis you must ban the other two .
since this will not happen , cannabis ought to be legalised in the same way .
but then this would only make a " right " out of three wrongs instead of just two .
martin snook , baldock , herts the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source myles , san francisco , usa trying to tackle the problem after the drugs are in the country will not work .
the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source .
until the governments of drug producing countries step up and stop this problem , it will always exist on our streets .
there is no other way .
myles , san francisco , usa having worked with teenagers whose minds and bodies have been irreparably damaged and their lives -lrb- and the lives of others -rrb- ruined by what started as recreational use , i must say that anyone who advocates legalisation is irresponsible and stupid .
mike , ivybridge , uk legalisation is the only way to take drugs away from criminal activity and to face up to the issue as an unavoidable recreation for so many in the uk .
for too long there has been the futile " war on drugs " and the governments fighting it have all lost , the dismal finale being the magic mushroom criminalisation as a class a drug over the summer .
it is now time to maturely face up to reality and tax substances according to their health risk , maintaining a clean , accessible supply for users .
lee d , newcastle , uk i am also one of those who prefer a ' crafty one ' in comfortable surroundings with a few mates .
this makes me very bias but i also know people who have created nothing but problems for themselves because of much harder substances .
alcohol should be at least a category b drug .
rob , corby , england i wonder if people would be so eager to legalise drugs if it were their children that had died due to drug addiction ?
drugs kill people , alcohol kills people , tobacco kills people .
make them all illegal .
just because people do it , does n't mean to say we should make it acceptable by legalising it .
d , west yorkshire learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work dave , london learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work .
drugs are not a modern problem .
mankind has been using drugs for thousands of years .
from the egyptians to the romans to our modern day artists , drugs have influenced our society .
do not make criminals out of ordinary folk .
how many times do we hear " terror groups " get their funding from drug money ?
why not remove this source of income and use it to benefit society ?
dave , london what stopped me taking heroin ?
the kids from grange hill or seeing a junkie dead in a doorway with a needle in their arm in amsterdam .
legalise , let people see for themselves how cool being a drug addict is .
simon soaper , england as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal , there is no argument whatsoever .
drugs must be legal too .
the sheer hypocrisy and irrationality of this surmounts any discussion .
tom franklin , london , uk the answer is certainly not prohibition .
that just puts the whole market underground , and that market will always be there regardless of the state officials and other moralists who do n't like it .
i do n't want my taxes wasted on criminalising people who want to indulge in chemically-assisted recreation .
what i do want is a society which has enough going for it that people do n't need to escape on a trip , and that includes being less vindictive against those unfortunate enough to get addicted .
drugs of various kinds have been around for centuries , but the only time we have noticed a " problem " with them is when they became illegal .
phil , uk legalise , tax and strictly control the supply alison , leeds , uk making dangerous drugs illegal does not stop people from taking them and ruining their lives as a consequence .
legalise , tax and strictly control the supply .
this can be used to help educate users and offer safer , cleaner supplies to people who are currently taking their lives into their own hands with their addiction .
if we remove the criminal element from the cycle , more people can live safely and hopefully get the help they need to live cleanly .
alison , leeds , uk i 'm 30 , i have a full time job and have worked since leaving school .
i pay my taxes , i pay my bills and after a hard day at work i go home and have a few joints of cannabis instead of a few pints of beer .
this is my choice of how i want to relax and socialise .
i stay in my own home with friends and family , i 'm not out on the streets vandalising and abusing passers by intoxicated on alcohol .
but unfortunately i am classed as a criminal .
alex , surrey uk we must legalise all drugs , and the manufacture and sale of them should be taxed and regulated by the government .
purity , quality and quantity would be uniform and if prices were kept low the multi-million pound illegal drugs market would collapse overnight .
it would greatly reduced addict-related petty crime , and drastically reduce gun crime between feuding drug gangs .
sarah , se london yet another area where schools need to play a part deb , uk unfortunately this is yet another area where schools need to play a part .
they already do this through pshe and no doubt some parents wo n't like it , but if children are educated about drugs in an age appropriate way and taught assertiveness techniques to help them say " no " , hopefully they will be better equipped to be drug free adults .
there needs to be an investment at that level .
much cheaper than paying for rehabilitation and the cost of drug related crime .
deb , uk drugs are a fact of modern society .
i believe that they should be treated like tobacco .
legalise it , tax it , prohibit it , educate against it .
that may cut crime and deglamourise it .
david stevens , nottingham , england legalise - simple !
scott , leeds , uk even those of us who condemn drug abuse , who have never used or intend to use drugs and who educate our children in the dangers of using drugs can not help but notice the increase in violence surrounding the trading of illegal narcotics .
the gun crime and gun ownership is now more terrifying than the drugs themselves and is surely moving the debate into new areas .
lorraine , st albans , uk if alcohol is free , taxed and widely available , i do n't see why drugs should not .
pascal , cambridge , uk i 'm 19 years old and currently hold a job in it .
many of my friends also hold a respectable job like me and pay tax like any other citizen .
i do n't drink alcohol .
i am , however , a recreational drug user , like many of my friends .
we do n't go out pubbing / clubbing at the weekend , that 's not my scene .
i find the atmosphere too aggressive , too competitive .
you ca n't look at anyone without risking a fight .
i just want to relax with my mates .
however , not everyone can handle certain drugs , and all drugs have different risks .
the government will never be able to stamp out illegal drug use so they should be looking to support those who want / need help and those who do n't ... leave them be as long as they do n't cause trouble to society .

it causes mood swings , inability to relax unaided by the drug , paranoia , psychosis , insomnia , depression , anxiety and panic attacks , to name but a few of its side-effects .
i would never have believed it until i witnessed this first hand .
over and over again .
without any doubt , this drug is not as innocent as some would like to believe .

i do n't smoke cigarettes on their own and i do n't touch alcohol .
i work full time in a good job and have 3 children and have no adverse effects .

graham , bedfordshire over the years , there has been far more harm caused by alcohol and cigarettes than by the use of cannabis .
but the government wo n't ban alcohol cigarettes because of the revenue it produces .
if you ban cannabis you must ban the other two .
since this will not happen , cannabis ought to be legalised in the same way .
but then this would only make a " right " out of three wrongs instead of just two .
martin snook , baldock , herts the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source myles , san francisco , usa trying to tackle the problem after the drugs are in the country will not work .
the only way to stop drugs from getting used on our streets is to cut them off at source .
until the governments of drug producing countries step up and stop this problem , it will always exist on our streets .
there is no other way .
myles , san francisco , usa having worked with teenagers whose minds and bodies have been irreparably damaged and their lives -lrb- and the lives of others -rrb- ruined by what started as recreational use , i must say that anyone who advocates legalisation is irresponsible and stupid .
mike , ivybridge , uk legalisation is the only way to take drugs away from criminal activity and to face up to the issue as an unavoidable recreation for so many in the uk .
for too long there has been the futile " war on drugs " and the governments fighting it have all lost , the dismal finale being the magic mushroom criminalisation as a class a drug over the summer .
it is now time to maturely face up to reality and tax substances according to their health risk , maintaining a clean , accessible supply for users .
lee d , newcastle , uk i am also one of those who prefer a ' crafty one ' in comfortable surroundings with a few mates .
this makes me very bias but i also know people who have created nothing but problems for themselves because of much harder substances .
alcohol should be at least a category b drug .
rob , corby , england i wonder if people would be so eager to legalise drugs if it were their children that had died due to drug addiction ?
drugs kill people , alcohol kills people , tobacco kills people .
make them all illegal .
just because people do it , does n't mean to say we should make it acceptable by legalising it .
d , west yorkshire learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work dave , london learn a lesson from history - prohibition did n't work .
drugs are not a modern problem .
mankind has been using drugs for thousands of years .
from the egyptians to the romans to our modern day artists , drugs have influenced our society .
do not make criminals out of ordinary folk .
how many times do we hear " terror groups " get their funding from drug money ?
why not remove this source of income and use it to benefit society ?
dave , london what stopped me taking heroin ?
the kids from grange hill or seeing a junkie dead in a doorway with a needle in their arm in amsterdam .
legalise , let people see for themselves how cool being a drug addict is .
simon soaper , england as long as alcohol and cigarettes are legal , there is no argument whatsoever .
drugs must be legal too .
the sheer hypocrisy and irrationality of this surmounts any discussion .
tom franklin , london , uk the answer is certainly not prohibition .
that just puts the whole market underground , and that market will always be there regardless of the state officials and other moralists who do n't like it .
i do n't want my taxes wasted on criminalising people who want to indulge in chemically-assisted recreation .
what i do want is a society which has enough going for it that people do n't need to escape on a trip , and that includes being less vindictive against those unfortunate enough to get addicted .
drugs of various kinds have been around for centuries , but the only time we have noticed a " problem " with them is when they became illegal .
phil , uk legalise , tax and strictly control the supply alison , leeds , uk making dangerous drugs illegal does not stop people from taking them and ruining their lives as a consequence .
legalise , tax and strictly control the supply .
this can be used to help educate users and offer safer , cleaner supplies to people who are currently taking their lives into their own hands with their addiction .
if we remove the criminal element from the cycle , more people can live safely and hopefully get the help they need to live cleanly .
alison , leeds , uk i 'm 30 , i have a full time job and have worked since leaving school .
i pay my taxes , i pay my bills and after a hard day at work i go home and have a few joints of cannabis instead of a few pints of beer .
this is my choice of how i want to relax and socialise .
i stay in my own home with friends and family , i 'm not out on the streets vandalising and abusing passers by intoxicated on alcohol .
but unfortunately i am classed as a criminal .
alex , surrey uk we must legalise all drugs , and the manufacture and sale of them should be taxed and regulated by the government .
purity , quality and quantity would be uniform and if prices were kept low the multi-million pound illegal drugs market would collapse overnight .
it would greatly reduced addict-related petty crime , and drastically reduce gun crime between feuding drug gangs .
sarah , se london yet another area where schools need to play a part deb , uk unfortunately this is yet another area where schools need to play a part .
they already do this through pshe and no doubt some parents wo n't like it , but if children are educated about drugs in an age appropriate way and taught assertiveness techniques to help them say " no " , hopefully they will be better equipped to be drug free adults .
there needs to be an investment at that level .
much cheaper than paying for rehabilitation and the cost of drug related crime .
deb , uk drugs are a fact of modern society .
i believe that they should be treated like tobacco .
legalise it , tax it , prohibit it , educate against it .
that may cut crime and deglamourise it .
david stevens , nottingham , england legalise - simple !
scott , leeds , uk even those of us who condemn drug abuse , who have never used or intend to use drugs and who educate our children in the dangers of using drugs can not help but notice the increase in violence surrounding the trading of illegal narcotics .
the gun crime and gun ownership is now more terrifying than the drugs themselves and is surely moving the debate into new areas .
lorraine , st albans , uk if alcohol is free , taxed and widely available , i do n't see why drugs should not .
pascal , cambridge , uk i 'm 19 years old and currently hold a job in it .
many of my friends also hold a respectable job like me and pay tax like any other citizen .
i do n't drink alcohol .
i am , however , a recreational drug user , like many of my friends .
we do n't go out pubbing / clubbing at the weekend , that 's not my scene .
i find the atmosphere too aggressive , too competitive .
you ca n't look at anyone without risking a fight .
i just want to relax with my mates .
however , not everyone can handle certain drugs , and all drugs have different risks .
the government will never be able to stamp out illegal drug use so they should be looking to support those who want / need help and those who do n't ... leave them be as long as they do n't cause trouble to society .
